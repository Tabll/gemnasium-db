title: "serverless MCP Server vulnerable to Command Injection in list-projects tool"
description: "A command injection vulnerability exists in the Serverless Framework's
  built-in MCP server package (@serverless/mcp). This vulnerability only affects users
  of the experimental MCP server feature (serverless mcp), which represents less than
  0.1% of Serverless Framework users. The core Serverless Framework CLI and deployment
  functionality are not affected.\n\nThe vulnerability is caused by the unsanitized
  use of input parameters within a call to `child_process.exec`, enabling an attacker
  to inject arbitrary system commands. Successful exploitation can lead to remote
  code execution under the server process's privileges.\n\nThe server constructs and
  executes shell commands using unvalidated user input directly within command-line
  strings. This introduces the possibility of shell metacharacter injection (`|`,
  `>`, `&&`, etc.)."
