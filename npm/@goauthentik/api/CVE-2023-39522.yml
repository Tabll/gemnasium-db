package_slug: "npm/@goauthentik/api"
title: "Observable Discrepancy"
description: "goauthentik is an open-source Identity Provider. In affected versions
  using a recovery flow with an identification stage an attacker is able to determine
  if a username exists. Only setups configured with a recovery flow are impacted by
  this. Anyone with a user account on a system with the recovery flow described above
  is susceptible to having their username/email revealed as existing. An attacker
  can easily enumerate and check users' existence using the recovery flow, as a clear
  message is shown when a user does not exist. Depending on configuration this can
  either be done by username, email, or both. This issue has been addressed in versions
  2023.5.6 and 2023.6.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
  for this issue."
