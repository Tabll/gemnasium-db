title: "Withdrawn Advisory: eslint has a Stack Overflow when serializing objects with
  circular references"
description: "## Withdrawn Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because RuleTester
  is used for testing rules during development and results in a error rather than
  crashing the application.\n\n## Original Description\n\nThere is a Stack Overflow
  vulnerability in eslint before 9.26.0 when serializing objects with circular references
  in `eslint/lib/shared/serialization.js`. The exploit is triggered via the `RuleTester.run()`
  method, which validates test cases and checks for duplicates. During validation,
  the internal function `checkDuplicateTestCase()` is called, which in turn uses the
  `isSerializable()` function for serialization checks. When a circular reference
  object is passed in, `isSerializable()` enters infinite recursion, ultimately causing
  a Stack Overflow."
