title: "Malware in fsevents"
description: "This advisory is intended to inform the npm ecosystem with details to resolve a third-party malware
  incident that may have impacted your infrastructure if you are directly or transitively dependent on the
  [fsevents](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fsevents) npm package.\n\nfsevents v1.0.0 <= v1.2.10 downloaded binary
  executables that contained unintended code due to an expired cloud storage resource being reclaimed by a third
  party.\n\nThe fsevents npm package v1.0.0 through v1.2.10 attempts to fetch a pre-built binary executable artifact
  (fse.node) from cloud storage. If this fetch fails, fsevents v1.x will attempt to build this artifact directly
  from source.\n\nVersion 1.x of fsevents has been deprecated for several years and as a result the aforementioned
  cloud storage resource namespace was available for registration. A third party, unrelated to the fsevents
  maintainers, subsequently claimed this namespace and in April 2023 this third party started serving modified
  versions of the “fse.node” binary executable artifact to new fsevents v1.x users.\n\nAs of April 27, 2023 the cloud
  storage resource in question has been indefinitely suspended and is no longer serving binaries.\n\nThe affected
  cloud storage pre-fetch was [removed](https://github.com/fsevents/fsevents/commit/909af26846834642c81d19f4148afa3b7557b058)
  in fsevents version 1.2.11.\n\nThe impact of the modified versions of fse.node appears to be limited to information
  gathering.\n\nNote that initial analysis was performed for the modified artifact associated with fsevents v1.2.9,
  which was distributed as fse-v1.2.9-node-v72-darwin-x64.tar.gz prior to the cloud storage resource being
  suspended.\n\nFor more detailed analysis you may compare a decompilation of the v1.x fse.node artifacts on your
  systems with the intended fsevents v1.x source as it exists at https://github.com/fsevents/fsevents/tree/v1.x\n\n
  If you are dependent on the deprecated version of fsevents v1.x, the recommended course of action is to upgrade to
  fsevents v2.x or remove the dependency altogether as currently maintained versions of Node.js no longer require
  fsevents for file system watching on macOS.\n\n"
