title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command
  Injection')"
description: "webdrvr is a npm wrapper for Selenium Webdriver including Chromedriver
  / IEDriver / IOSDriver / Ghostdriver. webdrvr downloads binary resources over HTTP,

  execution (RCE) by swapping out the requested binary with an attacker controlled
  binary if the attacker is on the network or positioned in between the user and the
  remote server."
