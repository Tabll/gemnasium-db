package_slug: "npm/backslash"
title: "backslash@0.2.1 contains malware after npm account takeover"
description: "On 8 September 2025, the npm publishing account for `backslash` was
  taken over after a phishing attack. Version `0.2.1` was published, functionally
  identical to the previous patch version, but with a malware payload added attempting
  to redirect cryptocurrency transactions to the attacker's own addresses from within
  browser environments.\n\nLocal environments, server environments, command line applications,
  etc. are not affected. If the package was used in a browser context (e.g. a direct
  `<script>` inclusion, or via a bundling tool such as Babel, Rollup, Vite, Next.js,
  etc.) there is a chance the malware still exists and such bundles will need to be
  rebuilt.\n\nThe malware seemingly only targets cryptocurrency transactions and wallets
  such as MetaMask. See references below for more information on the payload."
