title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "Node-Red is a low-code programming for event-driven applications built
  using nodejs. Node-RED has a vulnerability which allows arbitrary path traversal
  via the Projects API. If the Projects feature is enabled, a user with `projects.read`
  permission is able to access any file via the Projects API. The issue has been patched
  in Node-RED The vulnerability applies only to the Projects feature which is not
  enabled by default in Node-RED. The primary workaround is not give untrusted users
  read access to the Node-RED editor."
