title: "Formidable relies on hexoid to prevent guessing of filenames for untrusted
  executable content"
description: "Formidable (aka node-formidable) 2.1.0 through 3.x before 3.5.3 relies
  on hexoid to prevent guessing of filenames for untrusted executable content; however,
  hexoid is documented as not \"cryptographically secure.\" (Also, there is a scenario
  in which only the last two characters of a hexoid string need to be guessed, but
  this is not often relevant.) NOTE: this does not imply that, in a typical use case,
  attackers will be able to exploit any hexoid behavior to upload and execute their
  own content."
