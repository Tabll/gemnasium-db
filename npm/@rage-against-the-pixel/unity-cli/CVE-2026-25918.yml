title: "unity-cli Exposes Plaintext Credentials in Debug Logs (sign-package command)"
description: "The sign-package command in @rage-against-the-pixel/unity-cli logs sensitive
  credentials in plaintext when the `--verbose` flag is used. Command-line arguments
  including `--email` and `--password` are output via JSON.stringify without sanitization,
  exposing secrets to shell history, CI/CD logs, and log aggregation systems.\n\nUsers
  who run sign-package with `--verbose` and credential arguments expose their Unity
  account passwords. This affects all versions prior to 1.8.2. The vulnerability requires
  explicit user action (using `--verbose`) but creates significant risk in automated
  and shared environments.\n\nWorkaround: Use environment variables (`UNITY_USERNAME`,
  `UNITY_PASSWORD`) instead of command-line arguments, and avoid the `--verbose` flag
  when working with credentials.\n\nExisting RageAgainstThePixel and Buildalon GitHub
  actions are unaffected as they use the environment variables exclusively."
