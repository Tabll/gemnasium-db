title: "Sandbox Breakout / Arbitrary Code Execution in sandbox"
description: "All versions of `sandbox` are vulnerable to Sandbox Escape leading to
  Remote Code Execution. The package fails to restrict access to the main context
  through `this.constructor.constructor` . This may allow attackers to execute arbitrary
  code in the system. Evaluating the payload `this.constructor.constructor('return
  process.env')()` prints the contents of `process.env`."
