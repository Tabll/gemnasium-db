title: "Static file leakage"
description: "As stated on \"The NPM Blog\", \"it was possible, through a carefully
  encoded URL, to get st to serve any file it could see, not just the ones in the
  static content directory, and you could also list the contents of directories, so
  it was very easy to go looking for sensitive files.\" The NPM registry relies on
  st, meaning that all the versions of all the npms published prior to March th may
  be corrupted. But there is no evidence that they *have* been corrupted."
