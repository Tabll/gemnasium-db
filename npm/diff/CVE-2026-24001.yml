title: "jsdiff has a Denial of Service vulnerability in parsePatch and applyPatch"
description: "Attempting to parse a patch whose filename headers contain the line
  break characters `\\r`, `\\u2028`, or `\\u2029` can cause the `parsePatch` method
  to enter an infinite loop. It then consumes memory without limit until the process
  crashes due to running out of memory.\n\nApplications are therefore likely to be
  vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack if they call `parsePatch` with a user-provided
  patch as input. A large payload is not needed to trigger the vulnerability, so size
  limits on user input do not provide any protection. Furthermore, some applications
  may be vulnerable even when calling `parsePatch` on a patch generated by the application
  itself if the user is nonetheless able to control the filename headers (e.g. by
  directly providing the filenames of the files to be diffed).\n\nThe `applyPatch`
  method is similarly affected if (and only if) called with a string representation
  of a patch as an argument, since under the hood it parses that string using `parsePatch`.
  Other methods of the library are unaffected.\n\nFinally, a second and lesser bug
  - a ReDOS - also exhibits when those same line break characters are present in a
  patch's *patch* header (also known as its \"leading garbage\"). A maliciously-crafted
  patch header of length *n* can take `parsePatch` O(*n*³) time to parse."
