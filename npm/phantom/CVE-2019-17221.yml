identifier: "CVE-2019-17221"
package_slug: "npm/phantom"
title: "Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties"
description: "PhantomJS has an arbitrary file read vulnerability, as demonstrated
  by an `XMLHttpRequest` for a `file://` URI. The vulnerability exists in the `page.open()`
  function of the webpage module, which loads a specified URL and calls a given callback.
  An attacker can supply a specially crafted HTML file, as user input, that allows
  reading arbitrary files on the filesystem. For example, if `page.render()` is the
  function callback, this generates a PDF or an image of the targeted file."
