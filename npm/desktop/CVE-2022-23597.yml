title: "Use After Free"
description: "Element Desktop is a Matrix client for desktop platforms with Element
  Web at its core. Element Desktop before 1.9.7 is vulnerable to a remote program
  execution bug with user interaction. The exploit is non-trivial and requires clicking
  on a malicious link, followed by another button click. To the best of our knowledge,
  the vulnerability has never been exploited in the wild. If you are using Element
  Desktop < 1.9.7, we recommend upgrading at your earliest convenience. If successfully
  exploited, the vulnerability allows an attacker to specify a file path of a binary
  on the victim's computer which then gets executed. Notably, the attacker does *not*
  have the ability to specify program arguments. However, in certain unspecified configurations,
  the attacker may be able to specify an URI instead of a file path which then gets
  handled using standard platform mechanisms. These may allow exploiting further vulnerabilities
  in those mechanisms, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution."
