package_slug: "npm/orejime"
title: "Orejime has executable code in HTML attributes"
description: "On HTML elements handled by Orejime, one could run malicious code by
  embedding `javascript:` code within data attributes.\nWhen consenting to the related
  purpose, Orejime would turn data attributes into unprefixed ones (i.e. `data-href`
  into `href`), thus executing the code.\n\nThis shouldn't have any impact on most
  setups, as elements handled by Orejime are generally hardcoded. The problem would
  only arise if somebody could inject HTML code within pages.\n\nSee https://github.com/boscop-fr/orejime/issues/142
  for the original report."
