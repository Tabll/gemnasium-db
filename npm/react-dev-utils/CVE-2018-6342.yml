title: "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
description: "react-dev-utils on Windows allows developers to run a local webserver
  for accepting various commands, including a command to launch an editor. The input
  to that command was not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker who can make a
  network request to the server (either via CSRF or by direct request) to execute
  arbitrary commands on the targeted system."
