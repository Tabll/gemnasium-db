title: "secp256k1-node allows private key extraction over ECDH"
description: "In `elliptic`-based version, `loadUncompressedPublicKey` has a check
  that the public key is on the curve: https://github.com/cryptocoinjs/secp256k1-node/blob/6d3474b81d073cc9c8cc8cfadb580c84f8df5248/lib/elliptic.js#L37-L39\n\n`loadCompressedPublicKey`
  is, however, missing that check: https://github.com/cryptocoinjs/secp256k1-node/blob/6d3474b81d073cc9c8cc8cfadb580c84f8df5248/lib/elliptic.js#L17-L19\n\nThat
  allows the attacker to use public keys on low-cardinality curves to extract enough
  information to fully restore the private key from as little as 11 ECDH sessions,
  and very cheaply on compute power\n\nOther operations on public keys are also affected,
  including e.g. `publicKeyVerify()` incorrectly returning `true` on those invalid
  keys, and e.g. `publicKeyTweakMul()` also returning predictable outcomes allowing
  to restore the tweak"
