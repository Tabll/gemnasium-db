title: "Orval Mock Generation Code Injection via const"
description: "I am reporting a code injection vulnerability in Orval’s mock generation
  pipeline affecting @orval/mock in both the 7.x and 8.x series. This issue is related
  in impact to the previously reported enum x-enumDescriptions (https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-h526-wf6g-67jv),
  but it affects a different code path in the faker-based mock generator rather than
  @orval/core.\n\nThe vulnerability allows untrusted OpenAPI specifications to inject
  arbitrary TypeScript/JavaScript into generated mock files via the const keyword
  on schema properties. These const values are interpolated into the mock scalar generator
  (getMockScalar in packages/mock/src/faker/getters/scalar.ts) without proper escaping
  or type-safe serialization, which results in attacker-controlled code being emitted
  into both interface definitions and faker/MSW handlers. I have confirmed that this
  occurs on orval@7.19.0 and orval@8.0.2 with mock: true, and that the generated mocks
  contain executable payloads such as require('child_process').execSync('id') in the
  output TypeScript.\n\n```yaml\nopenapi: 3.1.0\ninfo:\ntitle: Mock Const Injection
