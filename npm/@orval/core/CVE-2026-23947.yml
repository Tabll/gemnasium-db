title: "Orval has a code injection via unsanitized x-enum-descriptions in enum generation"
description: "Arbitrary code execution in environments consuming generated clients\n\nThis
  issue is similar in nature to the recently-patched MCP vulnerability (CVE-2026-22785),
  but affects a different code path in @orval/core that was not addressed by that
  fix.\n\nThe vulnerability allows untrusted OpenAPI specifications to inject arbitrary
  TypeScript/JavaScript code into generated clients via the x-enumDescriptions field,
  which is embedded without proper escaping in getEnumImplementation(). I have confirmed
  that the injection occurs during const enum generation and results in executable
  code within the generated schema files."
