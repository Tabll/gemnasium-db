package_slug: "npm/@conventional-changelog/git-client"
title: "@conventional-changelog/git-client has Argument Injection vulnerability"
description: "While the scope is only limited to writing a file with input from the
  git log result, it still allows to specify and overwrite any arbitrary files on
  disk, such as `.env` or as far as critical system configuration at `/etc` if the
  application is running as privileged `root` user.\n\nIt may be the library's design
  choice to expose a generic `params` object to allow any consuming users to specify
  random Git command line arguments, however it could be abused by attackers when
  developers aren't aware of the security risks which aren't communicated. As such,
  I recommend not ignoring, and either patching this insecure design gap with hardened
  secure coding practices (like in other APIs mentioned previously) or adding a security
  disclaimer to this library's documentation."
