package_slug: "npm/electron"
title: "Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')"
description: "Electron is a framework which lets you write cross-platform desktop
  applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Electron apps that are launched as
  command line executables are impacted. Specifically this issue can only be exploited
  if the following conditions are met: 1. The app is launched with an attacker-controlled
  working directory and 2. The attacker has the ability to write files to that working
  directory. This makes the risk quite low, in fact normally issues of this kind are
  considered outside of our threat model as similar to Chromium we exclude Physically
  Local Attacks but given the ability for this issue to bypass certain protections
  like ASAR Integrity it is being treated with higher importance. This issue has been
  fixed in versions:`26.0.0-beta.13`, `25.4.1`, `24.7.1`, `23.3.13`, and `22.3.19`.
  There are no app side workarounds, users must update to a patched version of Electron."
