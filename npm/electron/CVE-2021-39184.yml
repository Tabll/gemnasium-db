package_slug: "npm/electron"
title: "Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere"
description: "Electron is a framework for writing cross-platform desktop applications
  using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. A vulnerability allows a sandboxed renderer to request
  a `thumbnail` image of an arbitrary file on the user's system. The thumbnail can
  potentially include significant parts of the original file, including textual data
  in many cases. all contain a fix for the vulnerability. Two workarounds aside from
  upgrading are available. One may make the vulnerability significantly more difficult
  for an attacker to exploit by enabling `contextIsolation` in one's app. One may
  also disable the functionality of the `createThumbnailFromPath` API if one does
  not need it."
