package_slug: "npm/electron"
title: "Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity"
description: "Electron is an open source framework for writing cross-platform desktop
  applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. This only impacts apps that have the
  `embeddedAsarIntegrityValidation` and `onlyLoadAppFromAsar` fuses enabled. Apps
  without these fuses enabled are not impacted. This issue is specific to macOS as
  these fuses are only currently supported on macOS. Specifically this issue can only
  be exploited if your app is launched from a filesystem the attacker has write access
  too. i.e. the ability to edit files inside the `.app` bundle on macOS which these
  fuses are supposed to protect against. There are no app side workarounds, you must
  update to a patched version of Electron."
