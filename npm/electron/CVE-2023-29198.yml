package_slug: "npm/electron"
title: "Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions"
description: "Electron is a framework which lets you write cross-platform desktop
  applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Electron apps using `contextIsolation`
  and `contextBridge` are affected. This is a context isolation bypass, meaning that
  code running in the main world context in the renderer can reach into the isolated
  Electron context and perform privileged actions. This issue is only exploitable
  if an API exposed to the main world via `contextBridge` can return an object or
  array that contains a javascript object which cannot be serialized, for instance,
  a canvas rendering context. This would normally result in an exception being thrown
  `Error: object could not be cloned`. The app side workaround is to ensure that such
  a case is not possible. Ensure all values returned from a function exposed over
  the context bridge are supported. This issue has been fixed in versions `25.0.0-alpha.2`,
  `24.0.1`, `23.2.3`, and `22.3.6`."
