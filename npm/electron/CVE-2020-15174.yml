identifier: "CVE-2020-15174"
package_slug: "npm/electron"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "In Electron the `will-navigate` event that apps use to prevent navigations
  to unexpected destinations as per our security recommendations can be bypassed when
  a sub-frame performs a top-frame navigation across sites. The issue is patched As
  a workaround sandbox all your iframes using the sandbox attribute. This will prevent
  them creating top-frame navigations and is good practice anyway."
