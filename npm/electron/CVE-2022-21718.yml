package_slug: "npm/electron"
title: "Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere"
description: "Electron is a framework for writing cross-platform desktop applications
  using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. A vulnerability in versions prior to `17.0.0-alpha.6`,
  `16.0.6`, `15.3.5`, `14.2.4`, and `13.6.6` allows renderers to obtain access to
  a bluetooth device via the web bluetooth API if the app has not configured a custom
  `select-bluetooth-device` event handler. This has been patched and Electron versions
  `17.0.0-alpha.6`, `16.0.6`, `15.3.5`, `14.2.4`, and `13.6.6` contain the fix. Code
  from the GitHub Security Advisory can be added to the app to work around the issue."
