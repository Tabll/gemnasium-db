package_slug: "npm/electron"
title: "Always-Incorrect Control Flow Implementation"
description: "Electron is a framework which lets you write cross-platform desktop
  applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. A ``Content-Security-Policy`` that
  disables eval, specifically setting a `script-src` directive and _not_ providing
  `unsafe-eval` in that directive, is not respected in renderers that have sandbox
  disabled. i.e. `sandbox: false` in the `webPreferences` object. This allows usage
  of methods like `eval()` and `new Function` unexpectedly which can result in an
  expanded attack surface. This issue only ever affected the 22 and 23 major versions
  of Electron and has been fixed in the latest versions of those release lines. Specifically,
  these versions contain the fixes: 22.0.1 and 23.0.0-alpha.2 We recommend all apps
  upgrade to the latest stable version of Electron. If upgrading isn't possible, this
  issue can be addressed without upgrading by enabling `sandbox: true` on all renderers."
