package_slug: "npm/electron"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "Electron is a framework for writing cross-platform desktop applications
  using JavaScript (JS), HTML, and CSS. A vulnerability in versions prior to 18.0.0-beta.6,
  17.2.0, 16.2.6, and 15.5.5 allows attackers who have control over a given apps update
  server / update storage to serve maliciously crafted update packages that pass the
  code signing validation check but contain malicious code in some components. This
  kind of attack would require significant privileges in a potential victim's own
  auto updating infrastructure and the ease of that attack entirely depends on the
  potential victim's infrastructure security. Electron versions 18.0.0-beta.6, 17.2.0,
  16.2.6, and 15.5.5 contain a fix for this issue. There are no known workarounds."
