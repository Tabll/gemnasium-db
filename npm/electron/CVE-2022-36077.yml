package_slug: "npm/electron"
title: "Insufficiently Protected Credentials"
description: "The Electron framework enables writing cross-platform desktop applications
  using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. In versions prior to 21.0.0-beta.1, 20.0.1, 19.0.11,
  and 18.3.7, Electron is vulnerable to Exposure of Sensitive Information. When following
  a redirect, Electron delays a check for redirecting to file:// URLs from other schemes.
  The contents of the file is not available to the renderer following the redirect,
  but if the redirect target is a SMB URL such as `file://some.website.com/`, then
  in some cases, Windows will connect to that server and attempt NTLM authentication,
  which can include sending hashed credentials.This issue has been patched in versions:
  21.0.0-beta.1, 20.0.1, 19.0.11, and 18.3.7. Users are recommended to upgrade to
  the latest stable version of Electron. If upgrading isn't possible, this issue can
  be addressed without upgrading by preventing redirects to `file://` URLs in the 
  `WebContents.on('will-redirect')` event, for all WebContents as a workaround."
