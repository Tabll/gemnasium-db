package_slug: "npm/electron"
title: "Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere"
description: "Electron is vulnerable to a context isolation bypass. Apps using both
  `contextIsolation` and `sandbox: true` are affected. Apps using both `contextIsolation`
  and `nodeIntegrationInSubFrames: true` are affected. This is a context isolation
  bypass, meaning that code running in the main world context in the renderer can
  reach into the isolated Electron context and perform privileged actions."
