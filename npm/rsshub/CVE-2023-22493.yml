title: "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
description: "RSSHub is an open source RSS feed generator. RSSHub is vulnerable to
  Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. This vulnerability allows an attacker
  to send arbitrary HTTP requests from the server to other servers or resources on
  the network. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a request to
  the affected routes with a malicious URL. An attacker could also use this vulnerability
  to send requests to internal or any other servers or resources on the network, potentially
  gain access to sensitive information that would not normally be accessible and amplifying
  the impact of the attack. The patch for this issue can be found in commit a66cbcf."
