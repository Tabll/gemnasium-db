title: "Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in micromatch"
description: "The NPM package `micromatch` prior to version 4.0.8 is vulnerable to
  Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). The vulnerability occurs in `micromatch.braces()`
  in `index.js` because the pattern `.*` will greedily match anything. By passing
  a malicious payload, the pattern matching will keep backtracking to the input while
  it doesn't find the closing bracket. As the input size increases, the consumption
  time will also increase until it causes the application to hang or slow down. There
  was a merged fix but further testing shows the issue persisted prior to https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch/pull/266.
  This issue should be mitigated by using a safe pattern that won't start backtracking
  the regular expression due to greedy matching."
