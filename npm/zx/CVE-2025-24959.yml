title: "ZX Allows Environment Variable Injection for dotenv API"
description: "This vulnerability is an **Environment Variable Injection** issue in
  `dotenv.stringify`, affecting `google/zx`  version **8.3.1**.\n\nAn attacker with
  control over environment variable values can inject unintended environment variables
  into `process.env`. This can lead to **arbitrary command execution** or **unexpected
  behavior** in applications that rely on environment variables for security-sensitive
  operations. Applications that process untrusted input and pass it through `dotenv.stringify`
  are particularly vulnerable."
