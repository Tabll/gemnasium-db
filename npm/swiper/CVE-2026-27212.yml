title: "Prototype pollution in swiper"
description: "A prototype pollution vulnerability exists in the the npm package swiper
  (>=6.5.1, < 12.1.2). Despite a previous fix that attempted to mitigate prototype
  pollution by checking whether user input contained a forbidden key, it is still
  possible to pollute `Object.prototype` via a crafted input using Array.prototype.
  The exploit works across Windows and Linux and on Node and Bun runtimes. This issue
  is fixed in version 12.1.2"
