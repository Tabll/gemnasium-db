package_slug: "npm/@replit/crosis"
title: "Potential exposure of tokens to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "@replit/crosis is a JavaScript client that speaks Replit's container
  protocol. A vulnerability that involves exposure of sensitive information exists
  When using this library as a way to programmatically communicate with Replit in
  a standalone fashion, if there are multiple failed attempts to contact Replit through
  a WebSocket, the library will attempt to communicate using a fallback poll-based
  proxy. The URL of the proxy has changed, so any communication done to the previous
  URL could potentially reach a server that is outside of Replit's control and the
  token used to connect to the Repl could be obtained by an attacker, leading to full
  compromise of that Repl (not of the account). This was patched by updating the address
  of the fallback WebSocket polling proxy to the new one. As a workaround, a user
  may specify the new address for the polling host (`gp-v2.replit.com`) in the `ConnectArgs`.
  More information about this workaround is available in the GitHub Security Advisory."
