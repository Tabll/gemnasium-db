title: "ExpressGateway Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability in lib/rest/routes/users.js"
description: "A cross-site scripting (XSS) issue exists in ExpressGateway up to 1.16.10
  in the REST endpoint implemented in lib/rest/routes/users.js. User-controlled input
  is reflected into the HTTP response without proper sanitization, allowing arbitrary
  JavaScript execution in the browser of a logged-in user who views the affected page/route.
  The attack can be triggered over the network with low complexity and requires a
  low-privileged authenticated context and user interaction (viewing the page). Impact
  is limited to confidentiality and integrity of the session in the affected UI."
