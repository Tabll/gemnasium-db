title: "Broken Authentication in Atlassian Connect Express"
description: "Broken Authentication in Atlassian Connect Express (ACE) from version
  3.0.2 before version 6.6.0: Atlassian Connect Express is a Node.js package for building
  Atlassian Connect apps. Authentication between Atlassian products and the Atlassian
  Connect Express app occurs with a server-to-server JWT or a context JWT. Atlassian
  Connect Express versions between 3.0.2 - 6.5.0 erroneously accept context JWTs in
  lifecycle endpoints (such as installation) where only server-to-server JWTs should
  be accepted, permitting an attacker to send authenticated re-installation events
  to an app."
