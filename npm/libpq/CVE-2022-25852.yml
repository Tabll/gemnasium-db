identifiers:
- "CVE-2022-25852"
package_slug: "npm/libpq"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')"
description: "All versions of package pg-native; all versions of package libpq is
  vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) when the addons attempt to cast the second
  argument to an array and fail. This happens for every non-array argument passed.
  **Note:** pg-native is a mere binding to npm's libpq library, which in turn has
  the addons and bindings to the actual C libpq library. This means that problems
  found in pg-native may transitively impact npm's libpq."
