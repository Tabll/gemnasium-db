title: "Embedded malware in coa"
description: "The npm package `coa` had versions published with malicious code. Users
  of affected versions (2.0.3 and above) should downgrade to 2.0.2 as soon as possible
  and check their systems for suspicious activity. See [this issue](https://github.com/veged/coa/issues/99) for
  details as they unfold.\nAny computer that has this package installed or running
  should be considered fully compromised. All secrets and keys stored on that computer
  should be rotated immediately from a different computer. The package should be removed,
  but as full control of the computer may have been given to an outside entity, there
  is no guarantee that removing the package will remove all malicious software resulting
  from installing it."
