title: "Missing Cryptographic Step"
description: "CaSS is a Competency and Skills System. CaSS Library, (npm:cassproject)
  has a missing cryptographic step when storing cryptographic keys that can allow
  a server administrator access to an account’s cryptographic keys. This affects CaSS
  servers using standalone username/password authentication, which uses a method that
  expects e2e cryptographic security of authorization credentials. The issue has been
  patched in 1.5.8, however, the vulnerable accounts are only resecured when the user
  next logs in using standalone authentication, as the data required to resecure the
  account is not available to the server. The issue may be mitigated by using SSO
  or client side certificates to log in. Please note that SSO and client side certificate
  authentication does not have this expectation of no-knowledge credential access,
  and cryptographic keys are available to the server administrator."
