title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command
  Injection')"
description: "The package snyk before 1.1064.0 is vulnerable to Code Injection when
  analyzing a project. An attacker who can convince a user to scan a malicious project
  can include commands in a build file such as build.gradle or gradle-wrapper.jar,
  which will be executed with the privileges of the application. This vulnerability
  may be triggered when running the the CLI tool directly, or when running a scan
  with one of the IDE plugins that invoke the Snyk CLI. Successful exploitation of
  this issue would likely require some level of social engineering - to coerce an
  untrusted project to be downloaded and analyzed via the Snyk CLI or opened in an
  IDE where a Snyk IDE plugin is installed and enabled. Additionally, if the IDE has
  a Trust feature then the target folder must be marked as ‘trusted’ in order to be
  vulnerable. **NOTE:** This issue is independent of the one reported in [CVE-2022-40764](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-SNYK-3037342),
  and upgrading to a fixed version for this addresses that issue as well. The affected
  IDE plugins and versions are: - VS Code - Affected: <=1.8.0, Fixed: 1.9.0 - IntelliJ
  - Affected: <=2.4.47, Fixed: 2.4.48 - Visual Studio - Affected: <=1.1.30, Fixed:
  1.1.31 - Eclipse - Affected: <=v20221115.132308, Fixed: All subsequent versions
  - Language Server - Affected: <=v20221109.114426, Fixed: All subsequent versions"
