title: "Denial of Service in http-live-simulator"
description: "Versions of `http-live-simulator` prior to 1.0.8 are vulnerable to Denial
  of Service. The package fails to catch an exception that causes the Node process
  to crash, effectively shutting down the server. This allows an attacker to send
  an HTTP request that crashes the server.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version
  1.0.8 or later."
