title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command
  Injection')"
description: "qbs is a build tool that helps simplify the build process for developing
  projects across multiple platforms. qbs downloads binary resources over HTTP, which
  leaves it vulnerable to MITM attacks. It may be possible to cause remote code execution
  (RCE) by swapping out the requested resources with an attacker controlled copy if
  the attacker is on the network or positioned in between the user and the remote
  server."
