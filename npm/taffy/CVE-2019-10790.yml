package_slug: "npm/taffy"
title: "Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere"
description: "taffy allows attackers to forge adding additional properties into user-input
  processed by taffy which can allow access to any data items in the DB. taffy sets
  an internal index for each data item in its DB. However, it is found that the internal
  index can be forged by adding additional properties into user-input. If index is
  found in the query, taffyDB will ignore other query conditions and directly return
  the indexed data item. Moreover, the internal index is in an easily-guessable format
  (e.g., T000002R000001). As such, attackers can use this vulnerability to access
  any data items in the DB."
