package_slug: "npm/swagger-ui"
title: "Injection Vulnerability"
description: "A Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) injection vulnerability in Swagger UI
  allows attackers to use the Relative Path Overwrite (RPO) technique to perform CSS-based
  input field value exfiltration, such as exfiltration of a CSRF token value. In other
  words, this product intentionally allows the embedding of untrusted JSON data from
  remote servers, but it was not previously known that `<style>@import` within the
  JSON data was a functional attack method."
