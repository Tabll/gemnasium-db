package_slug: "npm/swagger-ui"
title: "Cross-Site Scripting in swagger-ui"
description: "Affected versions of `swagger-ui` are vulnerable to cross-site scripting.
  This vulnerability exists because `swagger-ui` automatically executes external Javascript
  that is loaded in via the `url` query string parameter when a `Content-Type: application/javascript`
  header is included.\n\nAn attacker can create a server that replies with a malicious
  script and the proper content-type, and then craft a `swagger-ui` URL that includes
  the location to their server/script in the `url` query string parameter. When viewed,
  such a link would execute the attacker's malicious script.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate
  to 2.2.1 or later."
