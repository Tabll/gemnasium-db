title: "Insecure Credential Storage in web3"
description: "All versions of `web3` are vulnerable to Insecure Credential Storage.
  The package stores encrypted wallets in local storage and requires a password to
  load the wallet. Once the wallet is loaded, the private key is accessible via LocalStorage.
  Exploiting this vulnerability likely requires a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability
  to access the private key. No fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative
  module until a fix is made available."
