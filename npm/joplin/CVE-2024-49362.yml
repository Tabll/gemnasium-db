title: "Remote Code Execution on click of <a> Link in markdown preview"
description: "There is a vulnerability in `Joplin-desktop` that leads to remote code
  execution (RCE) when a user clicks on an `<a>` link within untrusted notes. The
  issue arises due to insufficient sanitization of `<a>` tag attributes introduced
  by the `Mermaid`. This vulnerability allows the execution of untrusted HTML content

  shell command execution."
