package_slug: "npm/shescape"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream
  Component ('Injection')"
description: "Shescape is a simple shell escape package for JavaScript. Versions prior
  to 1.5.8 were found to be subject to code injection on windows. This impacts users
  that use Shescape (any API function) to escape arguments for cmd.exe on Windows
  An attacker can omit all arguments following their input by including a line feed
  character (`'\\n'`) in the payload. This bug has been patched in [v1.5.8] which
  you can upgrade to now. No further changes are required. Alternatively, line feed
  characters (`'\\n'`) can be stripped out manually or the user input can be made
  the last argument (this only limits the impact)."
