package_slug: "npm/shescape"
title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "Shescape is a shell escape package for JavaScript. An issue in versions
  1.4.0 to 1.5.1 allows for exposure of the home directory on Unix systems when using
  Bash with the `escape` or `escapeAll` functions from the _shescape_ API with the
  `interpolation` option set to `true`. Other tested shells, Dash and Zsh, are not
  affected. Depending on how the output of _shescape_ is used, directory traversal
  may be possible in the application using _shescape_. The issue was patched in version
  1.5.1. As a workaround, manually escape all instances of the tilde character (`~`)
  using `arg.replace(/~/g, \"\\\\~\")`."
