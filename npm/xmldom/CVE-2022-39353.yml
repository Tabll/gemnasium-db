package_slug: "npm/xmldom"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "xmldom is a pure JavaScript W3C standard-based (XML DOM Level 2 Core)
  `DOMParser` and `XMLSerializer` module. xmldom parses XML that is not well-formed
  because it contains multiple top level elements, and adds all root nodes to the
  `childNodes` collection of the `Document`, without reporting any error or throwing.
  This breaks the assumption that there is only a single root node in the tree, which
  led to issuance of CVE-2022-39299 as it is a potential issue for dependents. Update
  to @xmldom/xmldom@~0.7.7, @xmldom/xmldom@~0.8.4 (dist-tag latest) or @xmldom/xmldom@>=0.9.0-beta.4
  (dist-tag next). As a workaround, please one of the following approaches depending
  on your use case: instead of searching for elements in the whole DOM, only search
  in the `documentElement`or reject a document with a document that has more then
  1 `childNode`."
