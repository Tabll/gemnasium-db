package_slug: "npm/next"
title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "Next. one must use next start or a custom server and the built-in i18n
  support. Deployments on Vercel, along with similar environments where invalid requests
  are filtered before reaching Next.js, are not affected. A patch has been released,
  `next@12.0.9`, that mitigates this issue. As a workaround, one may ensure `/${locale}/_next/`
  is blocked from reaching the Next.js instance until it becomes feasible to upgrade."
