title: "Next.js has Unbounded Memory Consumption via PPR Resume Endpoint "
description: "A denial of service vulnerability exists in Next.js versions with Partial
  Prerendering (PPR) enabled when running in minimal mode. The PPR resume endpoint
  accepts unauthenticated POST requests with the `Next-Resume: 1` header and processes
  attacker-controlled postponed state data. Two closely related vulnerabilities allow
  an attacker to crash the server process through memory exhaustion:\n\n1. **Unbounded
  request body buffering**: The server buffers the entire POST request body into memory
  using `Buffer.concat()` without enforcing any size limit, allowing arbitrarily large
  payloads to exhaust available memory.\n\n2. **Unbounded decompression (zipbomb)**:
  The resume data cache is decompressed using `inflateSync()` without limiting the
  decompressed output size. A small compressed payload can expand to hundreds of megabytes
  or gigabytes, causing memory exhaustion.\n\nBoth attack vectors result in a fatal
  V8 out-of-memory error (`FATAL ERROR: Reached heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript
  heap out of memory`) causing the Node.js process to terminate. The zipbomb variant
  is particularly dangerous as it can bypass reverse proxy request size limits while
  still causing large memory allocation on the server.\n\nTo be affected, an application
  must run with `experimental.ppr: true` or `cacheComponents: true` configured along
  with the NEXT_PRIVATE_MINIMAL_MODE=1 environment variable.\n\nStrongly consider
  upgrading to 15.6.0-canary.61 or 16.1.5 to reduce risk and prevent availability
  issues in Next applications."
