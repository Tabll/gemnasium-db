title: "Information exposure in Next.js dev server due to lack of origin verification"
description: "A low-severity vulnerability in **Next.js** has been fixed in **version
  15.2.2**. This issue may have allowed limited source code exposure when the dev
  server was running with the App Router enabled. The vulnerability only affects local
  development environments and requires the user to visit a malicious webpage while
  `npm run dev` is active.\n\nBecause the mitigation is potentially a breaking change
  for some development setups, to opt-in to the fix, you must configure `allowedDevOrigins`
  in your next config after upgrading to a patched version. [Learn more](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/allowedDevOrigins).\n\nLearn
