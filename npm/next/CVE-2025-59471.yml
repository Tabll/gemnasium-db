title: "Next.js self-hosted applications vulnerable to DoS via Image Optimizer remotePatterns
  configuration"
description: "A DoS vulnerability exists in self-hosted Next.js applications that
  have `remotePatterns` configured for the Image Optimizer. The image optimization
  endpoint (`/_next/image`) loads external images entirely into memory without enforcing
  a maximum size limit, allowing an attacker to cause out-of-memory conditions by
  requesting optimization of arbitrarily large images. This vulnerability requires
  that `remotePatterns` is configured to allow image optimization from external domains
  and that the attacker can serve or control a large image on an allowed domain.\n\nStrongly
  consider upgrading to 15.5.10 and 16.1.5 to reduce risk and prevent availability
  issues in Next applications."
