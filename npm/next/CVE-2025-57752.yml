title: "Next.js Affected by Cache Key Confusion for Image Optimization API Routes"
description: "A vulnerability in Next.js Image Optimization has been fixed in v15.4.5
  and v14.2.31. When images returned from API routes vary based on request headers
  (such as `Cookie` or `Authorization`), these responses could be incorrectly cached
  and served to unauthorized users due to a cache key confusion bug.\n\nAll users
  are encouraged to upgrade if they use API routes to serve images that depend on
  request headers and have image optimization enabled.\n\nMore details at [Vercel
  Changelog](https://vercel.com/changelog/cve-2025-57752)"
