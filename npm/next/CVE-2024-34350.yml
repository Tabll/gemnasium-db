title: "Next.js Vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling"
description: "Inconsistent interpretation of a crafted HTTP request meant that requests
  are treated as both a single request, and two separate requests by Next.js, leading
  to desynchronized responses. This led to a response queue poisoning vulnerability
  in the affected Next.js versions.\n\nFor a request to be exploitable, the affected
  route also had to be making use of the [rewrites](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/rewrites)
  feature in Next.js."
