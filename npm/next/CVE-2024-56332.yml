title: "Next.js Allows a Denial of Service (DoS) with Server Actions"
description: "A Denial of Service (DoS) attack allows attackers to construct requests
  that leaves requests to Server Actions hanging until the hosting provider cancels
  the function execution.\n\n_Note: Next.js server is idle during that time and only
  keeps the connection open. CPU and memory footprint are low during that time._\n\nDeployments
  without any protection against long running Server Action invocations are especially
  vulnerable. Hosting providers like Vercel or Netlify set a default maximum duration
  on function execution to reduce the risk of excessive billing.\n\nThis is the same
  issue as if the incoming HTTP request has an invalid `Content-Length` header or
  never closes. If the host has no other mitigations to those then this vulnerability
  is novel.\n\nThis vulnerability affects only Next.js deployments using Server Actions."
