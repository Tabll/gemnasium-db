title: "Next.js Content Injection Vulnerability for Image Optimization"
description: "A vulnerability in **Next.js Image Optimization** has been fixed in
  **v15.4.5** and **v14.2.31**. The issue allowed attacker-controlled external image
  sources to trigger file downloads with arbitrary content and filenames under specific
  configurations. This behavior could be abused for phishing or malicious file delivery.\n\nAll
  users relying on `images.domains` or `images.remotePatterns` are encouraged to upgrade
  and verify that external image sources are strictly validated.\n\nMore details at
  [Vercel Changelog](https://vercel.com/changelog/cve-2025-55173)"
