title: "User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information"
description: "Next.js is vulnerable to User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical
  Information. In order to be affected, the `next.config.js` file must have an `images.domains`
  array assigned and the image host assigned in `images.domains` must allow user-provided
  SVG. If the `next.config.js` file has `images.loader` assigned to something other
  than default, the instance is not affected. As a workaround, change `next.config.js`
  to use a different `loader configuration` other than the default."
