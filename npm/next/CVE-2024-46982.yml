title: "Next.js Cache Poisoning"
description: "By sending a crafted HTTP request, it is possible to poison the cache
  of a non-dynamic server-side rendered route in the pages router (this does not affect
  the app router). When this crafted request is sent it could coerce Next.js to cache
  a route that is meant to not be cached and send a `Cache-Control: s-maxage=1, stale-while-revalidate`
  header which some upstream CDNs may cache as well.\n\nTo be potentially affected
  all of the following must apply:\n\n- Next.js between 13.5.1 and 14.2.9\n- Using
  pages router\n- Using non-dynamic server-side rendered routes e.g. `pages/dashboard.tsx`
  not `pages/blog/[slug].tsx`\n\nThe below configurations are unaffected:\n\n- Deployments
  using only app router\n- Deployments on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) are not affected"
