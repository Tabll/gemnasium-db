package_slug: "npm/sails"
title: "Broken CORS"
description: "Sails has an issue with the CORS configuration where the value of the
  origin header is reflected as the value for the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header.
  This would allow an attacker to make AJAX requests to vulnerable hosts through cross
  site scripting or a malicious HTML Document, effectively bypassing the Same Origin
  Policy. Note that this is only an issue when `allRoutes` is set to `true` and `origin`
  is set to `*` or left commented out in the sails CORS config file. The problem can
  be compounded when the cors `credentials` setting is not provided. At that point
  authenticated cross domain requests are possible."

affected_range: "<0.12.7"
fixed_versions:
- "0.12.7"
affected_versions: "All versions before 0.12.7"
solution: "When using Sails make sure to double check your CORS configuration. A misconfiguration
  in a production environment will result in a error message being written to the
  node process console upon application start in versions 0.12.7 and higher."
