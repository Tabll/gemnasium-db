title: "Timing Attack in express-basic-auth"
description: "Versions of `express-basic-auth` are vulnerable to Timing Attacks. The
  package uses nating string comparison instead of a constant time string compare
  which may lead to Timing Attacks. Timing Attacks can be used to increase the efficiency
  of brute-force attacks by removing the exponential increase in entropy gained from
  longer secrets."
