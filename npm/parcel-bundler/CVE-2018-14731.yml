title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "An issue was discovered in HMRServer.js in Parcel parcel-bundler. Attackers
  are able to steal developer's code because the origin of requests is not checked
  by the WebSocket server, which is used for HMR (Hot Module Replacement). Anyone
  can receive the HMR message sent by the WebSocket server via a ws://127.0.0.1 connection
  (with a random TCP port number) from any origin. The random port number can be found
  by connecting to http://127.0.0.1 and reading the \"new WebSocket\" line in the
  source code."
