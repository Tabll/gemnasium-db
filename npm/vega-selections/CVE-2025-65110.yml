title: "Vega XSS via expression abusing vlSelectionTuples function array map calls
  in environments with satisfactory function gadgets in the global scope"
description: "Vega offers the evaluation of expressions in a secure context. Arbitrary
  function call is prohibited. When an event is exposed to an expression, member get
  of window objects is possible. Because of this exposure, in some applications, a
  crafted object that sets a `map` value with a function copied from the window that
  results in calling `this.foo(this.bar)` can be passed to the vlSelectionTuples function,
  calling the copied `map` function, allowing DOM XSS to be achieved.\n\nIn practice,
  an accessible gadget like this exists in the global VEGA_DEBUG code.\n\n```js\nvlSelectionTuples({\nmap:
  event.view.VEGA_DEBUG.vega.CanvasHandler.prototype.on,\neventName: event.view.console.log,\n_handlers:{\nundefined:
  'alert(origin + ` XSS on version `+ VEGA_DEBUG.VEGA_VERSION)'\n},\n_handlerIndex:
  event.view.eval\n})\n```"
