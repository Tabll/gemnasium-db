package_slug: "npm/apostrophe"
title: "Denial of Service in apostrophe"
description: "Versions of `apostrophe` prior to 2.97.1 are vulnerable to Denial of
  Service. The `apostrophe-jobs` module sets a callback for incoming jobs and doesn't
  clear it regardless of its status. This causes the server to accumulate callbacks,
  allowing an attacker to start a large number of jobs and exhaust system memory.\n\n\n##
  Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 2.97.1 or later."
