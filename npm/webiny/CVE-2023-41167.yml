package_slug: "npm/webiny"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "@webiny/react-rich-text-renderer before 5.37.2 allows XSS attacks by
  content managers. This is a react component to render data coming from Webiny Headless
  CMS and Webiny Form Builder. Webiny is an open-source serverless enterprise CMS.
  The @webiny/react-rich-text-renderer package depends on the editor.js rich text
  editor to handle rich text content. The CMS stores rich text content from the editor.js
  into the database. When the @webiny/react-rich-text-renderer is used to render such
  content, it uses the dangerouslySetInnerHTML prop, without applying HTML sanitization.
  The issue arises when an actor, who in this context would specifically be a content
  manager with access to the CMS, inserts a malicious script as part of the user-defined
  input. This script is then injected and executed within the user's browser when
  the main page or admin page loads."
