title: "Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)"
description: "apollo-client-nextjs is the Apollo Client support for the Next.js App
  Router. The @apollo/experimental-apollo-client-nextjs NPM package is vulnerable
  to a cross-site scripting vulnerability. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker
  would need to either inject malicious input (e.g. by redirecting a user to a specifically-crafted
  link) or arrange to have malicious input be returned by a GraphQL server (e.g. by
  persisting it in a database). To fix this issue, please update to version 0.7.0
  or later."
