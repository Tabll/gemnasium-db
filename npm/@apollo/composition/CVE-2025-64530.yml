title: "@apollo/composition has Improper Enforcement of Access Control on Interface
  Types and Fields"
description: "A vulnerability in Apollo Federation's composition logic allowed some
  queries to Apollo Router to improperly bypass access controls on types/fields. Apollo
  Federation incorrectly allowed user-defined access control directives on interface
  types/fields, which could be bypassed by instead querying the implementing object
  types/fields in Apollo Router via inline or named fragments. A fix to composition
  logic in Federation now disallows interfaces types and fields to contain user-defined
  access control directives."
