  origin-validation bypass"
description: "A **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** vulnerability was identified
  in Apollo’s **Embedded Sandbox** and **Embedded Explorer**.\n\nThe vulnerability
  arises from missing origin validation in the client-side code that handles `window.postMessage`
  events. A malicious website can send forged messages to the embedding page, causing
  the victim’s browser to execute arbitrary GraphQL queries or mutations against their
  GraphQL server while authenticated with the victim’s cookies."
