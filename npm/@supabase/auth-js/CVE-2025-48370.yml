package_slug: "npm/@supabase/auth-js"
title: "auth-js Vulnerable to Insecure Path Routing from Malformed User Input"
description: "The library functions `getUserById`, `deleteUser`, `updateUserById`,
  `listFactors` and `deleteFactor` did not require the user supplied values to be
  valid UUIDs. This could lead to a URL path traversal, resulting in the wrong API
  function being called.\n\nImplementations that follow security best practice and
  validate user controlled inputs, such as the `userId` are not affected by this."
