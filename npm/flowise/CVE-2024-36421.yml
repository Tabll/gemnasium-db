title: "Flowise Cors Misconfiguration in packages/server/src/index.ts"
description: "Flowise is a drag & drop user interface to build a customized large
  language model flow. In version 1.4.3 of Flowise, A CORS misconfiguration sets the
  Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to all, allowing arbitrary origins to connect
  to the website. In the default configuration (unauthenticated), arbitrary origins
  may be able to make requests to Flowise, stealing information from the user. This
  CORS misconfiguration may be chained with the path injection to allow an attacker
  attackers without access to Flowise to read arbitrary files from the Flowise server.
  As of time of publication, no known patches are available."
