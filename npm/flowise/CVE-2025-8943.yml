package_slug: "npm/flowise"
title: "Flowise OS command remote code execution"
description: "The Custom MCPs feature is designed to execute OS commands, for instance,
  using tools like `npx` to spin up local MCP Servers. However, Flowise's inherent
  authentication and authorization model is minimal and lacks role-based access controls
  (RBAC). Furthermore, in Flowise versions before 3.0.1 the default installation operates
  without authentication unless explicitly configured. This combination allows unauthenticated
  network attackers to execute unsandboxed OS commands."
