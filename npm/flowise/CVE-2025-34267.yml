title: "Flowise: Authenticated Command Execution and Sandbox Bypass via Puppeteer
  and Playwright Packages"
description: "Flowise v3.0.1 < 3.0.8 and all versions after with 'ALLOW_BUILTIN_DEP'
  enabled contain an authenticated remote code execution vulnerability and node VM
  sandbox escape due to insecure use of integrated modules (Puppeteer and Playwright)
  within the nodevm execution environment. An authenticated attacker able to create
  or run a tool that leverages Puppeteer/Playwright can specify attacker-controlled
  browser binary paths and parameters. When the tool executes, the attacker-controlled
  executable/parameters are run on the host and circumvent the intended nodevm sandbox
  restrictions, resulting in execution of arbitrary code in the context of the host.\n\n**NOTE**:
  This vulnerability was incorrectly assigned as a duplicate CVE-2025-26319 and should
  be considered distinct from that identifier."
