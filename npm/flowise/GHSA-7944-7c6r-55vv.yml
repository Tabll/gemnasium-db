title: "FlowiseAI Pre-Auth Arbitrary Code Execution"
description: "An authenticated admin user of **FlowiseAI** can exploit the **Supabase
  RPC Filter** component to execute **arbitrary server-side code** without restriction.
  By injecting a malicious payload into the filter expression field, the attacker
  can directly trigger JavaScript's `execSync()` to launch reverse shells, access
  environment secrets, or perform any OS-level command execution.\n\nThis results
  in **full server compromise** and severe breach of trust boundaries between frontend
  input and backend execution logic."
