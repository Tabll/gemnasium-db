title: "Flowise Cross-site Scripting in /api/v1/public-chatflows/id"
description: "Flowise is a drag & drop user interface to build a customized large
  language model flow. In version 1.4.3 of Flowise, a reflected cross-site scripting
  vulnerability occurs in the `/api/v1/public-chatflows/id` endpoint. If the default
  configuration is used (unauthenticated), an attacker may be able to craft a specially
  crafted URL that injects Javascript into the user sessions, allowing the attacker
  to steal information, create false popups, or even redirect the user to other websites
  without interaction. If the chatflow ID is not found, its value is reflected in
  the 404 page, which has type text/html. This allows an attacker to attach arbitrary
  scripts to the page, allowing an attacker to steal sensitive information. This XSS
  may be chained with the path injection to allow an attacker without direct access
  to Flowise to read arbitrary files from the Flowise server. As of time of publication,
  no known patches are available."
