title: "Flowise has unsandboxed remote code execution via Custom MCP"
description: "The Custom MCPs feature is designed to execute OS commands, for instance,
  using tools like `npx` to spin up local MCP Servers. However, Flowise's inherent
  authentication and authorization model is minimal and lacks role-based access controls
  (RBAC). Furthermore, the default installation of Flowise operates without authentication
  unless explicitly configured using the `FLOWISE_USERNAME` and `FLOWISE_PASSWORD`
  environment variables.\n\nThis combination presents a significant security risk,
  potentially allowing users on the platform to execute unsandboxed system commands.
  This can result in Remote Code Execution (RCE) and complete compromise of the running
  platform container or server."
