title: "Flowise Cloud and Local Deployments have Unauthenticated Password Reset Token
  Disclosure that Leads to Account Takeover"
description: "The `forgot-password` endpoint in Flowise returns sensitive information
  including a valid password reset `tempToken` without authentication or verification.
  This enables any attacker to generate a reset token for arbitrary users and directly
  reset their password, leading to a complete **account takeover (ATO)**.\n\nThis
  vulnerability applies to **both the cloud service (`cloud.flowiseai.com`) and self-hosted/local
  Flowise deployments** that expose the same API.\n\n**CVSS v3.1 Base Score:** **9.8
  (Critical)**\n**Vector String:** `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`\n\n---"
