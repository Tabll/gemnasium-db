title: "Flowise OverrideConfig security vulnerability"
description: "Flowise allows developers to inject configuration into the Chainflow
  during execution through the `overrideConfig` option. This is supported in both
  the frontend web integration and the backend Prediction API.\n\nThis has a range
  of fundamental issues that are a **major** security vulnerability.\nWhile this feature
  is intentional, it should have strong protections added and be disabled by default.\n\nThese
  issues include:\n1. Remote code execution. While inside a sandbox this allows for\n1.
  Sandbox escape\n2. DoS by crashing the server\n3. SSRF\n2. Prompt Injection, both
  System and User\n1. Full control over LLM prompts\n2. Server variable and data exfiltration\nAnd
  many many more such as altering the flow of a conversation, prompt exfiltration
  via LLM proxying etc.\n\nThese issues are self-targeted and do not persist to other
  users but do leave the server and business exposed.\nAll issues are shown with the
  API but also work with the web embed."
