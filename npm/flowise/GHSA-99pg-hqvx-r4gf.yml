title: "Flowise has an Arbitrary File Read"
description: "An arbitrary file read vulnerability in the `chatId` parameter supplied
  to both the `/api/v1/get-upload-file` and `/api/v1/openai-assistants-file/download`
  endpoints allows unauthenticated users to read unintended files on the local filesystem.
  In the default Flowise configuration this allows reading of the local sqlite db
  and subsequent compromise of all database content."
