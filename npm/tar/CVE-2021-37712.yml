package_slug: "npm/tar"
title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "The npm package \"tar\" (aka node-tar) has an arbitrary file creation/overwrite
  and arbitrary code execution vulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any
  file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This
  is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally,
  in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is
  a directory, paths are cached when directories are created."
