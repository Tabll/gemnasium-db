title: "Arbitrary File Read/Write via Hardlink Target Escape Through Symlink Chain
  in node-tar Extraction"
description: "`tar.extract()` in Node `tar` allows an attacker-controlled archive
  to create a hardlink inside the extraction directory that points to a file outside
  the extraction root, using default options.\n\nThis enables **arbitrary file read
  and write** as the extracting user (no root, no chmod, no `preservePaths`).\n\nSeverity
  is high because the primitive bypasses path protections and turns archive extraction
  into a direct filesystem access primitive."
