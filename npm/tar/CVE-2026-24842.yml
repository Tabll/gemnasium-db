title: "node-tar Vulnerable to Arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite via Hardlink Path
  Traversal"
description: "node-tar contains a vulnerability where the security check for hardlink
  entries uses different path resolution semantics than the actual hardlink creation
  logic. This mismatch allows an attacker to craft a malicious TAR archive that bypasses
  path traversal protections and creates hardlinks to arbitrary files outside the
  extraction directory."
