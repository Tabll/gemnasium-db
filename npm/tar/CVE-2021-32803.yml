title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "The npm package \"tar\" (aka node-tar) before versions 6.1.2, 5.0.7,
  4.4.15, and 3.2.3 has an arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite vulnerability via insufficient
  symlink protection. `node-tar` aims to guarantee that any file whose location would
  be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring
  that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary
  `stat` calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached
  when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files
  that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory.
  This order of operations resulted in the directory being created and added to the
  `node-tar` directory cache. When a directory is present in the directory cache,
  subsequent calls to mkdir for that directory are skipped. However, this is also
  where `node-tar` checks for symlinks occur. By first creating a directory, and then
  replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass `node-tar`
  symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink
  into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that
  location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed
  in releases 3.2.3, 4.4.15, 5.0.7 and 6.1.2."
