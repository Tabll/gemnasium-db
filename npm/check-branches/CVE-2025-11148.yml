title: "check-branches is vulnerable to command Injection"
description: "All versions of the package check-branches are vulnerable to Command
  Injection.\n\ncheck-branches is a command-line tool that is interacted with locally,
  or via CI, to confirm no conflicts exist in git branches.\n\nHowever, the library
  follows these conventions which can be abused:\n1. It trusts branch names as they
  are (plain text)\n2. It spawns git commands by concatenating user input\n\nSince
  a branch name is potentially a user input - as users can create branches remotely
  via pull requests, or simply due to privileged access to a repository - it can effectively
  be abused to run any command."
