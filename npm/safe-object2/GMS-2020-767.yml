title: "Prototype Pollution in safe-object2"
description: "All versions of `safe-object2` are vulnerable to prototype pollution.
  The `settter()` function does not restrict the modification of an Object's prototype,
  which may allow an attacker to add or modify an existing property that will exist
  on all objects.\n\n\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider
  using an alternative package until a fix is made available."
