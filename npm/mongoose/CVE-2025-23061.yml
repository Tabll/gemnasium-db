title: "Mongoose search injection vulnerability"
description: "Mongoose versions prior to 8.9.5, 7.8.4, and 6.13.6 are vulnerable to
  improper use of the `$where` operator. This vulnerability arises from the ability
  of the `$where` clause to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in MongoDB queries,
  potentially leading to code injection attacks and unauthorized access or manipulation
  of database data.\n\nNOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2024-53900."
