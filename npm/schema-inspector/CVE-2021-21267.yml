description: "Schema-Inspector is an open-source tool to sanitize and validate JS
  objects (npm package schema-inspector). In, email address validation is vulnerable
  to a denial-of-service attack where some input will freeze the program or web browser
  page executing the code. This affects any current schema-inspector users using any
  version to validate email addresses. Users who do not do email validation, and instead
  do other types of validation (like string min or max length, etc), are not affected.
  Users should upgrade to, which uses a regex expression that isn't vulnerable to
  ReDoS."
