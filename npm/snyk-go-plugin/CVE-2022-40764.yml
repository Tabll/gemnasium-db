identifiers:
- "CVE-2022-40764"
package_slug: "npm/snyk-go-plugin"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')"
description: "Snyk CLI before 1.996.0 allows arbitrary command execution, affecting
  Snyk IDE plugins and the snyk npm package. Exploitation could follow from the common
  practice of viewing untrusted files in the Visual Studio Code editor, for example.
  The original demonstration was with shell metacharacters in the vendor.json ignore
  field, affecting snyk-go-plugin before 1.19.1. This affects, for example, the Snyk
  TeamCity plugin (which does not update automatically) before 20220930.142957."
