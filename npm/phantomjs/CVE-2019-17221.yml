title: "Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties"
description: "PhantomJS through 2.1.1 has an arbitrary file read vulnerability, as
  demonstrated by an XMLHttpRequest for a file:// URI. The vulnerability exists in
  the page.open() function of the webpage module, which loads a specified URL and
  calls a given callback. An attacker can supply a specially crafted HTML file, as
  user input, that allows reading arbitrary files on the filesystem. For example,
  if page.render() is the function callback, this generates a PDF or an image of the
  targeted file. NOTE: this product is no longer developed."
