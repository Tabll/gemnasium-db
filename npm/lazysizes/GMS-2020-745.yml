title: "Cross-Site Scripting in lazysizes"
description: "Versions of `lazysizes` prior to 5.2.1-rc1 are vulnerable to Cross-Site
  Scripting.  The `video-embed` plugin fails to sanitize the following attributes:
  data-vimeo, `data-vimeoparams`, `data-youtube` and `data-ytparams`. This allows
  attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in a victim's browser if the attacker
  has control over the vulnerable attributes.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to
  version 5.2.1-rc1 or later."
