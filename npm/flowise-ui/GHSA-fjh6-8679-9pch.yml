title: "Flowise does not Prevent Bypass of Password Confirmation - Unverified Password
  Change"
description: "Bypass of Password Confirmation - Unverified Password Change (authenticated
  change without current password)\n\nAn authenticated user is allowed to change their
  account password without supplying the current password or any additional verification.
  The application does not verify the actor’s authority to perform that credential
  change (no current-password check, no authorization enforcement). An attacker who
  is merely authenticated (or who can trick or coerce an authenticated session) can
  set a new password and gain control of the account. (ATO - Account Takeover)"
