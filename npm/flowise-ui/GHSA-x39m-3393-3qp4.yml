title: "Flowise doesn't Prevent Bypass of Password Confirmation through Unverified
  Email Change (credentials)"
description: "Unverified Email Change - Email as part of Credential / Unverified Account
  Recovery Channel Change\n\nThe application allows changing the account email address
  (used as a login identifier and/or password recovery address) without verifying
  the requester’s authority to make that change (no confirmation to the old email,
  no authentication step). Because email often functions as a credential or recovery
  channel, unverified email changes enable attackers to take over accounts by switching
  the account’s recovery/login address."
