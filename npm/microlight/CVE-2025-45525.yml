title: "Withdrawn Advisory: microlight.js has a null pointer dereference vulnerability"
description: "## Withdrawn Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because a website
  owner has to set CSS color values. The proof of concept doesn't demonstrate how
  a malicious user who is not the website owner can cause an application crash. This
  link has been maintained to preserve external references.\n\n## Original Description\nA
  null pointer dereference vulnerability was discovered in microlight.js (version
  0.0.7), a lightweight syntax highlighting library. When processing elements with
  non-standard CSS color values, the library fails to validate the result of a regular
  expression match before accessing its properties, leading to an uncaught TypeError
  and potential application crash."
