title: "Withdrawn Advisory: microlight allows a denial of service"
description: "## Withdrawn Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because the
  proof of concept does not demonstrate a practical security impact. This link is
  maintained to preserve external references.\n\n## Original Description\nA denial
  of service (DoS) vulnerability has been identified in the JavaScript library microlight
  version 0.0.7. This library, used for syntax highlighting, does not limit the size
  of textual content it processes in HTML elements with the microlight class. When
  excessively large content (e.g., 100 million characters) is processed, the reset
  function in microlight.js consumes excessive memory and CPU resources, causing browser
  crashes or unresponsiveness. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by tricking
  a user into visiting a malicious web page containing a microlight element with large
  content, resulting in a denial of service."
