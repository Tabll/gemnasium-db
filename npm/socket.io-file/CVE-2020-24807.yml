title: "File restriction bypass in socket.io-file"
description: "All versions of `socket.io-file`are vulnerable to a file restriction
  bypass. The validation for valid file types only happens on the client-side, which
  allows an attacker to intercept the Websocket request post-validation and alter
  the `name` value to upload any file types.\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider
  using an alternative package until a fix is made available."
