title: "OpenClaw exec approvals: safeBins could bypass stdin-only constraints via
  shell expansion"
description: "OpenClaw's exec-approvals allowlist supports a small set of \"safe bins\"
  intended to be stdin-only (no positional file arguments) when running `tools.exec.host=gateway|node`
  with `security=allowlist`.\n\nIn affected configurations, the allowlist validation
  checked pre-expansion argv tokens, but execution used a real shell (`sh -c`) which
  expands globs and environment variables. This allowed safe bins like `head`, `tail`,
  or `grep` to read arbitrary local files via tokens such as `*` or `$HOME/...` without
  triggering approvals.\n\nThis issue is configuration-dependent and is not exercised
  by default settings (default `tools.exec.host` is `sandbox`)."
