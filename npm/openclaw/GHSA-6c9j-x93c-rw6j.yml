title: "OpenClaw safeBins file-existence oracle information disclosure"
description: "An information disclosure vulnerability in OpenClaw's `tools.exec.safeBins`
  approval flow allowed a file-existence oracle.\n\nWhen safe-bin validation examined
  candidate file paths, command allow/deny behavior could differ based on whether
  a path already existed on the host filesystem. An attacker could probe for file
  presence by comparing outcomes for existing vs non-existing filenames."
