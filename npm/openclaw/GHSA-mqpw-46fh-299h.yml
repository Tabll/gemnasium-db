title: "OpenClaw authorization bypass: operator.write can resolve exec approvals via
  chat.send -> /approve"
description: "A gateway client authenticated with a device token scoped only to `operator.write`
  (without `operator.approvals`) could approve/deny pending exec approval requests
  by sending a chat message containing the built-in `/approve` command.\n\n`exec.approval.resolve`
  is correctly scoped to `operator.approvals` for direct RPC calls, but the `/approve`
  command path invoked it via an internal privileged gateway client."
