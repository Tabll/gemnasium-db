title: "OpenClaw's Windows cmd.exe parsing may bypass exec allowlist/approval gating"
description: "On Windows nodes, exec requests were executed via `cmd.exe /d /s /c
  <rawCommand>`. In allowlist/approval-gated mode, the allowlist analysis did not
  model Windows `cmd.exe` parsing and metacharacter behavior. A crafted command string
  could cause `cmd.exe` to interpret additional operations (for example command chaining
  via `&`, or expansion via `%...%` / `!...!`) beyond what was allowlisted/approved."
