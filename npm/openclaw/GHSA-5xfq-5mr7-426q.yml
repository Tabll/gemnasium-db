title: "OpenClaw's unsanitized session ID enables path traversal in transcript file
  operations"
description: "OpenClaw versions **<= 2026.2.9** construct transcript file paths using
  an unsanitized `sessionId` and also accept `sessionFile` paths without enforcing
  that they stay within the agent sessions directory.\n\nA crafted `sessionId` and/or
  `sessionFile` (example: `../../etc/passwd`) can cause path traversal when the gateway
  performs transcript file read/write operations.\n\n**Preconditions:** an attacker
  must be able to authenticate to the gateway (gateway token/password). By default
  the gateway binds to `loopback` (local-only); configurations that expose the gateway
  widen the attack surface."
