title: "OpenClaw Twitch allowFrom is not enforced in optional plugin, unauthorized
  chat users can trigger agent pipeline"
description: "In the optional Twitch channel plugin (`extensions/twitch`), `allowFrom`
  is documented as a hard allowlist of Twitch user IDs, but it was not enforced as
  a hard gate. If `allowedRoles` is unset or empty, the access control path defaulted
  to allow, so any Twitch user who could mention the bot could reach the agent dispatch
  pipeline.\n\n**Scope note:** This only affects deployments that installed and enabled
  the Twitch plugin. Core OpenClaw installs that do not install/enable the Twitch
  plugin are not impacted."
