title: "OpenClaw MS Teams inbound attachment downloader leaks bearer tokens to allowlisted
  suffix domains"
description: "NOTE: This only affects deployments that enable the optional MS Teams
  extension (Teams channel). If you do not use MS Teams, you are not impacted.\n\nWhen
  OpenClaw downloads inbound MS Teams attachments / inline images, it may retry a
  URL with an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header after receiving `401` or `403`.\n\nBecause
  the default download allowlist uses suffix matching (and includes some multi-tenant
  suffix domains), a message that references an untrusted but allowlisted host could
  cause that bearer token to be sent to the wrong place."
