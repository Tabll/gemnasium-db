title: "OpenClaw log poisoning (indirect prompt injection) via WebSocket headers"
description: "In `openclaw` versions prior to `2026.2.13`, OpenClaw logged certain
  WebSocket request headers (including `Origin` and `User-Agent`) without neutralization
  or length limits on the \"closed before connect\" path.\n\nIf an unauthenticated
  client can reach the gateway and send crafted header values, those values may be
  written into core logs. Under workflows where logs are later read or interpreted
  by an LLM (for example via AI-assisted debugging), this can increase the risk of
  indirect prompt injection (log poisoning)."
