title: "OpenClaw: Command hijacking via unsafe PATH handling (bootstrapping + node-host
  PATH overrides)"
description: "OpenClaw previously accepted untrusted PATH sources in limited situations.
  In affected versions, this could cause OpenClaw to resolve and execute an unintended
  binary (\"command hijacking\") when running host commands.\n\nThis issue primarily
  matters when OpenClaw is relying on allowlist/safe-bin protections and expects `PATH`
  to be trustworthy."
