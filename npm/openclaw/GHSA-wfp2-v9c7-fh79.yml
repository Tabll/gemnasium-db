title: "OpenClaw affected by SSRF via attachment/media URL hydration"
description: "Versions of the `openclaw` npm package prior to `2026.2.2` could be
  coerced into fetching arbitrary `http(s)` URLs during attachment/media hydration.
  An attacker who can influence the media URL (for example via model-controlled `sendAttachment`
  or auto-reply media URLs) could trigger SSRF to internal resources and exfiltrate
  the fetched bytes as an outbound attachment."
