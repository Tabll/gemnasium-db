title: "OpenClaw replaced a deprecated sandbox hash algorithm"
description: "The sandbox identifier cache key for Docker/browser sandbox configuration
  used SHA-1 to hash normalized configuration payloads.\n\nSHA-1 is deprecated for
  cryptographic use and has known collision weaknesses. In this code path, deterministic
  IDs are used to decide whether an existing sandbox container can be reused safely.
  A collision in this hash could let one configuration be interpreted as another under
  the same sandbox cache identity, increasing the risk of cache poisoning and unsafe
  sandbox state reuse.\n\nThe implementation now uses SHA-256 for these deterministic
  hashes to restore collision resistance for this security-relevant identifier path."
