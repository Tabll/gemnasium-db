title: "OpenClaw's unauthenticated Nostr profile HTTP endpoints allow remote profile/config
  tampering"
description: "The OpenClaw Nostr channel plugin (optional, disabled by default, installed
  separately) exposes profile management HTTP endpoints under `/api/channels/nostr/:accountId/profile`
  (GET/PUT) and `/api/channels/nostr/:accountId/profile/import` (POST). In affected
  versions, these routes were dispatched via the gateway plugin HTTP layer without
  requiring gateway authentication, allowing unauthenticated remote callers to read
  or mutate the Nostr profile and persist changes to the gateway config. Profile updates
  are also published as a signed Nostr kind:0 event using the bot's private key.\n\nDeployments
  that do not have the Nostr plugin installed and enabled are not impacted."
