package_slug: "npm/openclaw"
title: "OpenClaw has a path traversal in browser upload allows local file read"
description: "Authenticated attackers can read arbitrary files from the Gateway host
  by supplying absolute paths or path traversal sequences to the browser tool's `upload`
  action. The server passed these paths to Playwright's `setInputFiles()` APIs without
  restricting them to a safe root.\n\nSeverity remains **High** due to the impact
  (arbitrary local file read on the Gateway host), even though exploitation requires
  authenticated access."
