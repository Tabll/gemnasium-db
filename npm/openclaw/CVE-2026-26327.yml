title: "OpenClaw allows unauthenticated discovery TXT records could steer routing
  and TLS pinning"
description: "Discovery beacons (Bonjour/mDNS and DNS-SD) include TXT records such
  as `lanHost`, `tailnetDns`, `gatewayPort`, and `gatewayTlsSha256`. TXT records are
  unauthenticated.\n\nPrior to the fix, some clients treated TXT values as authoritative
  routing/pinning inputs:\n\n- iOS and macOS: used TXT-provided host hints (`lanHost`/`tailnetDns`)
  and ports (`gatewayPort`) to build the connection URL.\n- iOS and Android: allowed
  the discovery-provided TLS fingerprint (`gatewayTlsSha256`) to override a previously
  stored TLS pin.\n\nOn a shared/untrusted LAN, an attacker could advertise a rogue
  `_openclaw-gw._tcp` service. This could cause a client to connect to an attacker-controlled
  endpoint and/or accept an attacker certificate, potentially exfiltrating Gateway
  credentials (`auth.token` / `auth.password`) during connection."
