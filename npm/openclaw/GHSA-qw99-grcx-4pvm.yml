title: "OpenClaw's Chrome extension relay binds publicly due to wildcard treated as
  loopback"
description: "The Chrome extension relay (`ensureChromeExtensionRelayServer`) previously
  treated wildcard hosts (`0.0.0.0` / `::`) as loopback, which could make it bind
  the relay HTTP/WS server to all interfaces when a wildcard `cdpUrl` was passed."
