title: "OpenClaw has a webhook auth bypass when gateway is behind a reverse proxy
  (loopback remoteAddress trust)"
description: "The BlueBubbles webhook handler previously treated any request whose
  socket `remoteAddress` was loopback (`127.0.0.1`, `::1`, `::ffff:127.0.0.1`) as
  authenticated. When OpenClaw Gateway is behind a reverse proxy (Tailscale Serve/Funnel,
  nginx, Cloudflare Tunnel, ngrok), the proxy typically connects to the gateway over
  loopback, allowing unauthenticated remote requests to bypass the configured webhook
  password.\n\nThis could allow an attacker who can reach the proxy endpoint to inject
  arbitrary inbound BlueBubbles message/reaction events."
