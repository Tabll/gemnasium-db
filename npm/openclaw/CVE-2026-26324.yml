title: "OpenClaw has a SSRF guard bypass via full-form IPv4-mapped IPv6 (loopback
  / metadata reachable)"
description: "OpenClaw's SSRF protection could be bypassed using full-form IPv4-mapped
  IPv6 literals such as `0:0:0:0:0:ffff:7f00:1` (which is `127.0.0.1`). This could
  allow requests that should be blocked (loopback / private network / link-local metadata)
  to pass the SSRF guard.\n\n- Vulnerable component: SSRF guard (`src/infra/net/ssrf.ts`)\n-
  Issue type: SSRF protection bypass"
