title: "React Router allows a DoS via cache poisoning by forcing SPA mode"
description: "After some research, it turns out that it is possible to force an application
  to switch to SPA mode by adding a header to the request. If the application uses
  SSR and is forced to switch to SPA, this causes an error that completely corrupts
  the page. If a cache system is in place, this allows the response containing the
  error to be cached, resulting in a cache poisoning that strongly impacts the availability
  of the application."
