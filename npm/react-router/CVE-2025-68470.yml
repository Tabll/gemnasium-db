title: "React Router has unexpected external redirect via untrusted paths"
description: "An attacker-supplied path can be crafted so that when a React Router
  application navigates to it via `navigate()`, `<Link>`, or `redirect()`, the app
  performs a navigation/redirect to an external URL. This is only an issue if developers
  pass untrusted content into navigation paths in their application code."
