title: "React Router vulnerable to XSS via Open Redirects"
description: "React Router (and Remix v1/v2) SPA open navigation redirects originating
  from loaders or actions in [Framework Mode](https://reactrouter.com/start/modes#framework),
  [Data Mode](https://reactrouter.com/start/modes#data), or the unstable RSC modes

  This is only an issue if developers are creating redirect paths from untrusted content
  or via an open redirect.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> This does not impact applications that
  use [Declarative Mode](https://reactrouter.com/start/modes#declarative) (`<BrowserRouter>`)."
