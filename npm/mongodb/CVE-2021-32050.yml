package_slug: "npm/mongodb"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command
  Injection')"
description: "Some MongoDB Drivers may erroneously publish events containing authentication-related
  data to a command listener configured by an application. The published events may
  contain security-sensitive data when specific authentication-related commands are
  executed.\n\nWithout due care, an application may inadvertently expose this sensitive
  information, e.g., by writing it to a log file. This issue only arises if an application
  enables the command listener feature (this is not enabled by default).\n\nThis issue
  affects the MongoDB C Driver 1.0.0 prior to 1.17.7, MongoDB PHP Driver 1.0.0 prior
  to 1.9.2, MongoDB Swift Driver 1.0.0 prior to 1.1.1, MongoDB Node.js Driver 3.6
  prior to 3.6.10, MongoDB Node.js Driver 4.0 prior to 4.17.0 and MongoDB Node.js
  Driver 5.0 prior to 5.8.0. This issue also affects users of the MongoDB C++ Driver
  dependent on the C driver 1.0.0 prior to 1.17.7 (C++ driver prior to 3.7.0).\n\n"
