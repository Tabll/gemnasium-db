title: "fast-filesystem-mcp has a Path Traversal vulnerability"
description: "fast-filesystem-mcp version 3.4.0 contains a critical path traversal
  vulnerability in its file operation tools including fast_read_file. This vulnerability
  arises from improper path validation that fails to resolve symbolic links to their
  actual physical paths. The safePath and isPathAllowed functions use path.resolve()
  which does not handle symlinks, allowing attackers to bypass directory access restrictions
  by creating symlinks within allowed directories that point to restricted system
  paths. When these symlinks are accessed through valid path references, the validation
  checks are circumvented, enabling access to unauthorized files."
