package_slug: "npm/bootstrap-tagsinput"
title: "Cross-Site Scripting in bootstrap-tagsinput"
description: "All versions of `bootstrap-tagsinput` are vulnerable to cross-site scripting
  when user input is passed into the `itemTitle` parameter unmodified, as the package
  fails to properly sanitize or encode user input for that parameter.\n\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nThis
  package is not actively maintained, and has not seen an update since 2015. \n\nBecause
  of this, the simplest mitigation is to avoid using the `itemTitle` parameter. With
  over 200 open issues and over 100 open pull requests as of 2/2018, it seems unlikely
  that the author has any intention of maintaining the module. If avoiding the use
  of `itemTitle` indefinitely is acceptable, this is a workable solution. If not,
  the best available mitigation is to use a fork of the module that is actively maintained
  and provides similar functionality. There are [many such forks to choose from available
  on github.](https://github.com/bootstrap-tagsinput/bootstrap-tagsinput/network/members)."
