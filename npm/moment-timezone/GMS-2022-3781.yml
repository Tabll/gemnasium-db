title: "Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information in moment-timezone"
description: "### Impact\n\n* if Alice uses `grunt data` (or `grunt release`) to prepare
  a custom-build, moment-timezone with the latest tzdata from IANA's website\n* and
  Mallory intercepts the request to IANA's unencrypted ftp server, Mallory can serve
  data which might exploit further stages of the moment-timezone tzdata pipeline,
  or potentially produce a tainted version of moment-timezone (practicality of such
  attacks is not proved)\n\n### Patches\nProblem has been patched in version 0.5.35,
  patch should be applicable with minor modifications to all affected versions. The
  patch includes changing the FTP endpoint with an HTTPS endpoint.\n\n### Workarounds\nSpecify
  the exact version of tzdata (like `2014d`, full command being `grunt data:2014d`,
  then run the rest of the release tasks by hand), or just apply the patch before
  issuing the grunt command.\n"
