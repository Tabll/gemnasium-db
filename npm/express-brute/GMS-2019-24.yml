title: "Rate Limiting Bypass in express-brute"
description: "All versions of `express-brute` are vulnerable to Rate Limiting Bypass.
  Concurrent requests may lead to race conditions that cause the package to incorrectly
  count requests. This may allow an attacker to bypass the rate limiting provided
  by the package and execute requests without limiting. No fix is currently available.
  Consider using an alternative module until a fix is made available."
