package_slug: "npm/@fedify/fedify"
title: "Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack in Fedify"
description: "At present, when Fedify needs to retrieve an object or activity from
  a remote activitypub server, it makes a HTTP request to the `@id` or other resources
  present within the activity it has received from the web. This activity could reference
  an `@id` that points to an internal IP address, allowing an attacker to send request
  to resources internal to the fedify server's network.\n\nThis applies to not just
  resolution of documents containing activities or objects, but also to media URLs
  as well.\n\nSpecifically this is a [Server Side Request Forgery attack](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Server_Side_Request_Forgery).
  You can learn more about SSRF attacks via [CWE-918](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/918.html)"
