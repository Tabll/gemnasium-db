title: "Improper handling of multiline messages in node-irc"
description: "node-irc is a socket wrapper for the IRC protocol that extends Node.js'
  EventEmitter. The vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate a Matrix user into
  executing IRC commands by having them reply to a maliciously crafted message. Incorrect
  handling of a CR character allowed for making part of the message be sent to the
  IRC server verbatim rather than as a message to the channel.\nThe vulnerability
  has been patched in node-irc version 1.2.1."
