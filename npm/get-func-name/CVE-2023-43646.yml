package_slug: "npm/get-func-name"
title: "Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity"
description: "get-func-name is a module to retrieve a function's name securely and
  consistently both in NodeJS and the browser. Versions prior to 2.0.1 are subject
  to a regular expression denial of service (redos) vulnerability which may lead to
  a denial of service when parsing malicious input. This vulnerability can be exploited
  when there is an imbalance in parentheses, which results in excessive backtracking
  and subsequently increases the CPU load and processing time significantly. This
  vulnerability can be triggered using the following input: '\\t'.repeat(54773) +
  '\\t/function/i'. This issue has been addressed in commit `f934b228b` which has
  been included in releases from 2.0.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no
  known workarounds for this vulnerability."
