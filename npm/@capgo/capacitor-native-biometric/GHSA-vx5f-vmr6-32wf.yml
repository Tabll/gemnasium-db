title: "cap-go/capacitor-native-biometric Authentication Bypass"
description: "The [cap-go/capacitor-native-biometric](https://github.com/Cap-go/capacitor-native-biometric)
  library was found to be subject to an authentication bypass as the current implementation
  of the `onAuthenticationSucceeded()` does not appear to handle a `CryptoObject`[^HackTricks1]
  [^SecuringBiometricAuthentication] as seen in the following code block starting
  from [line 88 in AuthActivity.java](https://github.com/Cap-go/capacitor-native-biometric/blob/main/android/src/main/java/ee/forgr/biometric/AuthActivity.java#L88):\n\n```java\n@Override\npublic
  void onAuthenticationSucceeded(\n@NonNull BiometricPrompt.AuthenticationResult result\n)
  {\nsuper.onAuthenticationSucceeded(result);\nfinishActivity(\"success\");\n}\n```\n\nAs
  the current implementation only checks whether `onAuthenticationSucceeded()` was
  called and does not handle a `CryptoObject` the biometric authentication can be
  bypassed by hooking the `onAuthenticationSucceeded()` function."
