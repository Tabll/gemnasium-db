title: "Codex has sandbox bypass due to bug in path configuration logic"
description: "Due to a bug in the sandbox configuration logic, Codex CLI could treat
  a model-generated `cwd` as the sandboxâ€™s writable root, including paths outside
  of the folder where the user started their session.\n\nThis logic bypassed the intended
  workspace boundary and enables arbitrary file writes and command execution where
  the Codex process has permissions - this did not impact the network-disabled sandbox
  restriction.\n\n**Remediation**\nWe released a patch in Codex CLI **0.39.0** that
  canonicalizes and validates that the boundary used for sandbox policy is based on
  where the user started the session, and not the one generated by the model. Users
  running 0.38.0 or earlier should update immediately via their package manager or
  by reinstalling the latest Codex CLI to ensure sandbox boundaries are enforced.\n\nIf
  using the Codex IDE extension, users should immediately update to **0.4.12** for
  a fix of the sandbox issue.\n\nThank you to Tzanko Matev (Codetracer) for reporting
  the issue!"
