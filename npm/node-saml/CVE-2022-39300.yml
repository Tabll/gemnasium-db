package_slug: "npm/node-saml"
title: "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature"
description: "node SAML is a SAML 2.0 library based on the SAML implementation of
  passport-saml. A remote attacker may be able to bypass SAML authentication on a
  website using passport-saml. A successful attack requires that the attacker is in
  possession of an arbitrary IDP signed XML element. Depending on the IDP used, fully
  unauthenticated attacks (e.g without access to a valid user) might also be feasible
  if generation of a signed message can be triggered. Users should upgrade to node-saml
  version 4.0.0-beta5 or newer. Disabling SAML authentication may be done as a workaround."
