package_slug: "npm/validator"
title: "Validator is Vulnerable to Incomplete Filtering of One or More Instances of
  Special Elements"
description: "Versions of the package validator before 13.15.22 are vulnerable to
  Incomplete Filtering of One or More Instances of Special Elements in the isLength()
  function that does not take into account Unicode variation selectors (\\uFE0F, \\uFE0E)
  appearing in a sequence which lead to improper string length calculation. This can
  lead to an application using isLength for input validation accepting strings significantly
  longer than intended, resulting in issues like data truncation in databases, buffer
  overflows in other system components, or denial-of-service."
