title: "validator.js has a URL validation bypass vulnerability in its isURL function"
description: "A URL validation bypass vulnerability exists in validator.js through
  version 13.15.15. The isURL() function uses '://' as a delimiter to parse protocols,
  while browsers use ':' as the delimiter. This parsing difference allows attackers
  to bypass protocol and domain validation by crafting URLs leading to XSS and Open
  Redirect attacks."
