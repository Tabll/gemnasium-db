package_slug: "npm/uptime-kuma"
title: "Session Fixation"
description: "Uptime Kuma is an easy-to-use self-hosted monitoring tool. Prior to
  version 1.23.9, when a user changes their login password in Uptime Kuma, a previously
  logged-in user retains access without being logged out. This behavior persists consistently,
  even after system restarts or browser restarts. This vulnerability allows unauthorized
  access to user accounts, compromising the security of sensitive information. The
  same vulnerability was partially fixed in CVE-2023-44400, but logging existing users
  out of their accounts was forgotten. To mitigate the risks associated with this
  vulnerability, the maintainers made the server emit a `refresh` event (clients handle
  this by reloading) and then disconnecting all clients except the one initiating
  the password change. It is recommended to update Uptime Kuma to version 1.23.9."
