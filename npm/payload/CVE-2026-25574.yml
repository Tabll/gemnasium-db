title: "payload-preferences has Cross-Collection IDOR in Access Control (Multi-Auth
  Environments)"
description: "A cross-collection Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability
  exists in the `payload-preferences` internal collection. In multi-auth collection
  environments using Postgres or SQLite with default serial/auto-increment IDs, authenticated
  users from one auth collection can read and delete preferences belonging to users
  in different auth collections when their numeric IDs collide.\n\n**Users are affected
  if ALL of these are true:**\n\n- Multiple auth collections configured (e.g., `admins`
  + `customers`)\n- Postgres or SQLite database adapter with serial/auto-increment
  IDs\n- Users in different auth collections with the same numeric ID\n\n**Not affected:**\n\n-
  `@payloadcms/db-mongodb` adapter\n- Single auth collection environments\n- Postgres/SQLite
  with `idType: 'uuid'`"
