package_slug: "npm/payload"
title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "Payload is a free and open source headless content management system.
  In versions prior to 1.7.0, if a user has access to documents that contain hidden
  fields or fields they do not have access to, the user could reverse-engineer those
  values via brute force. Version 1.7.0 contains a patch. As a workaround, write a
  `beforeOperation` hook to remove `where` queries that attempt to access hidden field
  data."
