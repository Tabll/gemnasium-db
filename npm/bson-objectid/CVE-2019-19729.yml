identifier: "CVE-2019-19729"
package_slug: "npm/bson-objectid"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "An issue was discovered in the BSON ObjectID (aka `bson-objectid`).
  `ObjectID()` allows an attacker to generate a malformed objectid by inserting an
  additional property to the user-input, because bson-objectid will return early if
  it detects `_bsontype==ObjectID` in the user-input object. As a result, objects
  in arbitrary forms can bypass formatting if they have a valid bsontype."
