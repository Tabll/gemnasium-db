package_slug: "npm/undici"
title: "Improper Certificate Validation"
description: "`Undici.ProxyAgent` never verifies the remote server's certificate,
  and always exposes all request & response data to the proxy. This unexpectedly means
  that proxies can MitM all HTTPS traffic, and if the proxy's URL is HTTP then it
  also means that nominally HTTPS requests are actually sent via plain-text HTTP between
  Undici and the proxy server."
