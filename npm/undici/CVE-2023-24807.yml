package_slug: "npm/undici"
title: "Regular Expression Denial of Service in Headers"
description: "Undici is an HTTP/1.1 client for Node.js. Prior to version 5.19.1, the
  `Headers.set()` and `Headers.append()` methods is vulnerable to Regular Expression
  Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks when untrusted values are passed into the functions.
  This is due to the inefficient regular expression used to normalize the values in
  the `headerValueNormalize()` utility function. This vulnerability was patched in
  v5.19.1. No known workarounds are available."
