package_slug: "npm/undici"
title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "Undici is an HTTP/1.1 client written from scratch for Node.js. Prior
  to version 5.26.2, Undici already cleared Authorization headers on cross-origin
  redirects, but does not clear `Cookie` headers. By design, `cookie` headers are
  forbidden request headers, disallowing them to be set in RequestInit.headers in
  browser environments. Since undici handles headers more liberally than the spec,
  there was a disconnect from the assumptions the spec made, and undici's implementation
  of fetch. As such this may lead to accidental leakage of cookie to a third-party
  site or a malicious attacker who can control the redirection target (ie. an open
  redirector) to leak the cookie to the third party site. This was patched in version
  5.26.2. There are no known workarounds."
