title: "Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')"
description: "undici is an HTTP/1.1 client, written from scratch for Node.js. It is
  possible to inject CRLF sequences into request headers in undici in versions less
  than 5.7.1. A fix was released in version 5.8.0. Sanitizing all HTTP headers from
  untrusted sources to eliminate `\\r\\n` is a workaround for this issue."
