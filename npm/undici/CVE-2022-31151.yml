title: "Uncleared cookies on cross-host / cross-origin redirect"
description: "Authorization headers are cleared on cross-origin redirect. However,
  cookie headers which are sensitive headers and are official headers found in the
  spec, remain uncleared. There are active users using cookie headers in undici. This
  may lead to accidental leakage of cookie to a 3rd-party site or a malicious attacker
  who can control the redirection target (ie. an open redirector) to leak the cookie
  to the 3rd party site. This was patched in v5.7.1. By default, this vulnerability
  is not exploitable. Do not enable redirections, i.e. `maxRedirections: 0` (the default)."
