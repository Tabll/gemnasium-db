package_slug: "npm/undici"
title: "Undici has an unbounded decompression chain in HTTP responses on Node.js Fetch
  API via Content-Encoding leads to resource exhaustion"
description: "The `fetch()` API supports chained HTTP encoding algorithms for response
  content according to RFC 9110 (e.g., Content-Encoding: gzip, br). This is also supported
  by the undici decompress interceptor.\n\nHowever, the number of links in the decompression
  chain is unbounded and the default maxHeaderSize allows a malicious server to insert
  thousands compression steps leading to high CPU usage and excessive memory allocation."
