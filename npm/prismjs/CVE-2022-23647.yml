package_slug: "npm/prismjs"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "Prism is a syntax highlighting library. Starting with version 1.14.0
  and prior to version 1.27.0, Prism's command line plugin can be used by attackers
  to achieve a cross-site scripting attack. The command line plugin does not properly
  escape its output, leading to the input text being inserted into the DOM as HTML
  code. Server-side usage of Prism is not impacted. Websites that do not use the Command
  Line plugin are also not impacted. This bug has been fixed in v1.27.0. As a workaround,
  do not use the command line plugin on untrusted inputs, or sanitize all code blocks
  (remove all HTML code text) from all code blocks that use the command line plugin."
