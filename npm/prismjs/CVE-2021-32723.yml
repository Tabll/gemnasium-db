description: "Prism is a syntax highlighting library. Some languages is vulnerable
  to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). When Prism is used to highlight
  untrusted (user-given) text, an attacker can craft a string that will take a very
  very long time to highlight. As a workaround, do not use ASCIIDoc or ERB to highlight
  untrusted text. Other languages are not affected and can be used to highlight untrusted
  text."
