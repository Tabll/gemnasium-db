package_slug: "npm/ssrfcheck"
title: "ssrfcheck has Incomplete IP Address Deny List that leads to Server-Side Request
  Forgery Vulnerability"
description: "Versions of the package ssrfcheck before 1.2.0 are vulnerable to Server-Side
  Request Forgery (SSRF) due to an incomplete denylist of IP address ranges. Specifically,
  the package fails to classify the reserved IP address space 224.0.0.0/4 (Multicast)
  as invalid. This oversight allows attackers to craft requests targeting these multicast
  addresses."
