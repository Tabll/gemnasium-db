identifier: "CVE-2017-16129"
package_slug: "npm/superagent"
title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "The HTTP client module superagent is vulnerable to ZIP bomb attacks.
  In a ZIP bomb attack, the HTTP server replies with a compressed response that becomes
  several magnitudes larger once uncompressed. If a client does not take special care
  when processing such responses, it may result in excessive CPU and/or memory consumption.
  An attacker might exploit such a weakness for a DoS attack. To exploit this the
  attacker must control the location (URL) that superagent makes a request to."
