title: "Duplicate Advisory: express-xss-sanitizer has an unbounded recursion depth"
description: "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-hvq2-wf92-j4f3. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n## Original Descripton\n\nThe `express-xss-sanitizer` package for
  Node.js has an unbounded recursion in the `sanitize` function (`lib/sanitize.js`)
  when processing JSON request bodies. A remote attacker can send a deeply nested
  payload to any endpoint that applies this sanitizer, driving excessive recursion
  and resource consumption (CPU) until the process becomes unresponsive or crashes
  (e.g., “Maximum call stack size exceeded”). This causes a denial of service. The
  issue is present through version 2.0.0; no fixed release is available as of this
  update."
