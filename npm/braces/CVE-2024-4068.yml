identifiers:
- "CVE-2024-4068"
package_slug: "npm/braces"
title: "Uncontrolled resource consumption in braces"
description: "The NPM package `braces` fails to limit the number of characters it can handle, which could lead to Memory Exhaustion. 
  In `lib/parse.js`, if a malicious user sends `imbalanced braces` as input, the parsing will enter a loop, which will cause the 
  program to start allocating heap memory without freeing it at any moment of the loop. Eventually, the JavaScript heap limit is 
  reached, and the program will crash."
