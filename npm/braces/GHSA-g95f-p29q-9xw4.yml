title: "Duplicate Advisory: Regular Expression Denial of Service in braces"
description: "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-cwfw-4gq5-mrqx. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n## Original Description\nVersions of `braces` prior to 2.3.1 are
  vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). Untrusted input may
  cause catastrophic backtracking while matching regular expressions. This can cause
  the application to be unresponsive leading to Denial of Service.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade
  to version 2.3.1 or higher."
