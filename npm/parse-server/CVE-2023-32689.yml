title: "Phishing attack vulnerability by uploading malicious HTML file"
description: "Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure
  that can run Node.js. Versions prior to 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 is vulnerable to a phishing
  attack vulnerability that involves a user uploading malicious files. A malicious
  user could upload an HTML file to Parse Server via its public API. That HTML file
  would then be accessible at the internet domain at which Parse Server is hosted.
  The URL of the the uploaded HTML could be shared for phishing attacks. The HTML
  page may seem legitimate because it is served under the internet domain where Parse
  Server is hosted, which may be the same as a company's official website domain.\n\nAn
  additional security issue arises when the Parse JavaScript SDK is used. The SDK
  stores sessions in the internet browser's local storage, which usually restricts
  data access depending on the internet domain. A malicious HTML file could contain
  a script that retrieves the user's session token from local storage and then share
  it with the attacker.\n\nThe fix included in versions 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 adds a new
  Parse Server option `fileUpload.fileExtensions` to restrict file upload on Parse
  Server by file extension. It is recommended to restrict file upload for HTML file
  extensions, which this fix disables by default. If an app requires upload of files
  with HTML file extensions, the option can be set to `['.*']` or another custom value
  to override the default."
