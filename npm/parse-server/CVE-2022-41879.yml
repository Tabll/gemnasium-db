title: "Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype
  Pollution')"
description: "Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure
  that can run Node.js. In versions prior to 5.3.3 or 4.10.20, a compromised Parse
  Server Cloud Code Webhook target endpoint allows an attacker to use prototype pollution
  to bypass the Parse Server `requestKeywordDenylist` option. This issue has been
  patched in versions 5.3.3 and 4.10.20. There are no known workarounds."
