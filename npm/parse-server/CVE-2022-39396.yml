title: "Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype
  Pollution')"
description: "Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure
  that can run Node.js. Versions prior to 4.10.18, and prior to 5.3.1 on the 5.X branch,
  is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution via prototype pollution. An attacker can

  MongoDB BSON parser. This issue is patched in version 5.3.1 and in 4.10.18. There
  are no known workarounds."
