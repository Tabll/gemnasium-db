description: "### Impact\nCertain types of invalid files requests are not handled
  properly and can crash the server. If you are running multiple Parse Server instances
  in a cluster, the availability impact may be low; if you are running Parse Server
  as a single instance without redundancy, the availability impact may be high.\n\n###
  Patches\nTo prevent this, invalid requests are now properly handled.\n\n### Workarounds\nNone\n\n###
