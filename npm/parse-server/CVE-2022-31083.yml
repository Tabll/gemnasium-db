package_slug: "npm/parse-server"
title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure
  that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 4.10.11 and 5.2.2, the certificate in the
  Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter not validated. As a result, authentication
  could potentially be bypassed by making a fake certificate accessible via certain
  Apple domains and providing the URL to that certificate in an authData object. Versions
  4.0.11 and 5.2.2 prevent this by introducing a new `rootCertificateUrl` property
  to the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter which takes the URL to the root
  certificate of Apple's Game Center authentication certificate. If no value is set,
  the `rootCertificateUrl` property defaults to the URL of the current root certificate
  as of May 27, 2022. Keep in mind that the root certificate can change at any time
  and that it is the developer's responsibility to keep the root certificate URL up-to-date
  when using the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter. There are no known workarounds
  for this issue."
