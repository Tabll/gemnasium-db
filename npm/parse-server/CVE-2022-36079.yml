package_slug: "npm/parse-server"
title: "Brute force guessing of user sensitive data via search patterns"
description: "Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure
  that can run Node.js. Internal fields (keys used internally by Parse Server, prefixed
  by `_`) and protected fields (user defined) can be used as query constraints. Internal
  and protected fields are removed by Parse Server and are only returned to the client
  using a valid master key. However, using query constraints, these fields can be
  guessed by enumerating until Parse Server, prior to versions 4.10.14 or 5.2.5, returns
  a response object. The patch available in versions 4.10.14 and 5.2.5 requires the
  master key to use internal and protected fields as query constraints. As a workaround,
  implement a Parse Cloud Trigger `beforeFind` and manually remove the query constraints."
