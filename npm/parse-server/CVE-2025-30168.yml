package_slug: "npm/parse-server"
title: "Parse Server has an OAuth login vulnerability"
description: "The 3rd party authentication handling of Parse Server allows the authentication
  credentials of some specific authentication providers to be used across multiple
  Parse Server apps. For example, if a user signed up using the same authentication
  provider in two unrelated Parse Server apps, the credentials stored by one app can
  be used to authenticate the same user in the other app. Note that this only affects
  Parse Server apps that specifically use an affected 3rd party authentication provider
  for user authentication, for example by setting the Parse Server option `auth` to
  configure a Parse Server authentication adapter. See the [3rd party authentication
  docs](https://docs.parseplatform.org/parse-server/guide/#oauth-and-3rd-party-authentication)
  for more information on which authentication providers are affected."
