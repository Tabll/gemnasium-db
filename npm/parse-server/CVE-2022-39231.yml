package_slug: "npm/parse-server"
title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure
  that can run Node.js. In versions prior to 4.10.16, or from 5.0.0 to 5.2.6, validation
  of the authentication adapter app ID for _Facebook_ and _Spotify_ may be circumvented.
  Configurations which allow users to authenticate using the Parse Server authentication
  adapter where `appIds` is set as a string instead of an array of strings authenticate
  requests from an app with a different app ID than the one specified in the `appIds`
  configuration. For this vulnerability to be exploited, an attacker needs to be assigned
  an app ID by the authentication provider which is a sub-set of the server-side configured
  app ID. This issue is patched in versions 4.10.16 and 5.2.7. There are no known
  workarounds."
