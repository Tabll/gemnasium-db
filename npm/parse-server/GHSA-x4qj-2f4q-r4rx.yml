title: "Parse Server Vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in File Upload
  via URI Format"
description: "A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the file upload
  functionality when trying to upload a `Parse.File` with `uri` parameter allows to
  execute an arbitrary URI. The vulnerability stems from a file upload feature in
  which Parse Server retrieves the file data from a URI that is provided in the request.
  A request to the provided URI is executed, but the response is not stored in Parse
  Server's file storage as the server crashes upon receiving the response."
