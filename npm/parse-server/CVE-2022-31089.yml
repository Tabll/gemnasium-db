title: "Unchecked Return Value"
description: "Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure
  that can run Node.js. In affected versions certain types of invalid files requests
  are not handled properly and can crash the server. If you are running multiple Parse
  Server instances in a cluster, the availability impact may be low; if you are running
  Parse Server as single instance without redundancy, the availability impact may
  be high. This issue has been addressed in versions 4.10.12 and 5.2.3. Users are
  advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue."
