package_slug: "npm/parse-server"
title: "Incorrect Resource Transfer Between Spheres"
description: "Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure
  that can run Node.js. In versions prior to 4.10.15, or 5.0.0 and above prior to
  5.2.6, a user can write to the session object of another user if the session object
  ID is known. For example, an attacker can assign the session object to their own
  user by writing to the `user` field and then read any custom fields of that session
  object. Note that assigning a session to another user does not usually change the
  privileges of either of the two users, and a user cannot assign their own session
  to another user. This issue is patched in version 4.10.15 and above, and 5.2.6 and
  above. To mitigate this issue in unpatched versions add a `beforeSave` trigger to
  the `_Session` class and prevent writing if the requesting user is different from
  the user in the session object."
