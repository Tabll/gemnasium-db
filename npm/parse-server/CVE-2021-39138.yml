package_slug: "npm/parse-server"
title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure
  that can run Node.js. Developers can use the REST API to signup users and also allow
  users to login anonymously., when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST,
  the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the `authProvider` field in
  `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password.
  If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level
  of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified
  the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does not currently
  use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal functions, so if a developer
  is not using `createdWith` directly, they are not affected. The vulnerability only
  affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly. As a workaround,
  do not use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous
  login."
