title: "@langchain/community affected by SSRF Bypass in RecursiveUrlLoader via insufficient
  URL origin validation"
description: "The `RecursiveUrlLoader` class in `@langchain/community` is a web crawler
  that recursively follows links from a starting URL. Its `preventOutside` option
  (enabled by default) is intended to restrict crawling to the same site as the base
  URL.\n\nThe implementation used `String.startsWith()` to compare URLs, which does
  not perform semantic URL validation. An attacker who controls content on a crawled
  page could include links to domains that share a string prefix with the target (e.g.,
  `https://example.com.attacker.com` passes a `startsWith` check against `https://example.com`),
  causing the crawler to follow links to attacker-controlled or internal infrastructure.\n\nAdditionally,
  the crawler performed no validation against private or reserved IP addresses. A
  crawled page could include links targeting cloud metadata services (`169.254.169.254`),
  localhost, or RFC 1918 addresses, and the crawler would fetch them without restriction."
