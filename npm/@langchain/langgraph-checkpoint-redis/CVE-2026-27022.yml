title: "RediSearch Query Injection in @langchain/langgraph-checkpoint-redis"
description: "A query injection vulnerability exists in the `@langchain/langgraph-checkpoint-redis`
  package's filter handling. The `RedisSaver` and `ShallowRedisSaver` classes construct
  RediSearch queries by directly interpolating user-provided filter keys and values
  without proper escaping. RediSearch has special syntax characters that can modify
  query behavior, and when user-controlled data contains these characters, the query
  logic can be manipulated to bypass intended access controls."
