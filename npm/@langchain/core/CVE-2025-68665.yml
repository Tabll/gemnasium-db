title: "LangChain serialization injection vulnerability enables secret extraction"
description: "Attackers who control serialized data can extract environment variable
  secrets by injecting `{\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"secret\", \"id\": [\"ENV_VAR\"]}`
  to load environment variables during deserialization (when `secretsFromEnv: true`).
  They can also instantiate classes with controlled parameters by injecting constructor
  structures to instantiate any class within the provided import maps with attacker-controlled
  parameters, potentially triggering side effects such as network calls or file operations.\n\nKey
  severity factors:\n\n- Affects the serialization path—applications trusting their
  own serialization output are vulnerable\n- Enables secret extraction when combined
  with `secretsFromEnv: true`\n- LLM responses in `additional_kwargs` can be controlled
  via prompt injection"
