title: "Typebot affected by Credential Theft via Client-Side Script Execution and
  API Authorization Bypass"
description: "Client-side script execution in Typebot allows stealing all stored credentials
  from any user. When a victim previews a malicious typebot by clicking \"Run\", JavaScript
  executes in their browser and exfiltrates their OpenAI keys, Google Sheets tokens,
  and SMTP passwords. The `/api/trpc/credentials.getCredentials` endpoint returns
  plaintext API keys without verifying credential ownership\n\n---"
