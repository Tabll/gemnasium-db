package_slug: "npm/qs"
title: "qs vulnerable to Prototype Pollution"
description: "qs before 6.10.3 allows attackers to cause a Node process hang because
  an `__ proto__` key can be used. In many typical web framework use cases, an unauthenticated
  remote attacker can place the attack payload in the query string of the URL that
  is used to visit the application, such as `a[__proto__]=b&a[__proto__]&a[length]=100000000`.
  The fix was backported to qs 6.9.7, 6.8.3, 6.7.3, 6.6.1, 6.5.3, 6.4.1, 6.3.3, and
  6.2.4."
