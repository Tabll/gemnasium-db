package_slug: "npm/qs"
title: "qs's arrayLimit bypass in its bracket notation allows DoS via memory exhaustion"
description: "The `arrayLimit` option in qs did not enforce limits for bracket notation
  (`a[]=1&a[]=2`), only for indexed notation (`a[0]=1`). This is a consistency bug;
  `arrayLimit` should apply uniformly across all array notations.\n\n**Note:** The
  default `parameterLimit` of 1000 effectively mitigates the DoS scenario originally
  described. With default options, bracket notation cannot produce arrays larger than
  `parameterLimit` regardless of `arrayLimit`, because each `a[]=value` consumes one
  parameter slot. The severity has been reduced accordingly."
