title: "Denial-of-Service Extended Event Loop Blocking in qs"
description: "The qs module before 1.0.0 does not have an option or default for specifying
  object depth and when parsing a string representing a deeply nested object will
  block the event loop for long periods of time. An attacker could leverage this to
  cause a temporary denial-of-service condition, for example, in a web application,
  other requests would not be processed while this blocking is occurring."
