identifiers:
- "CVE-2021-44907"
package_slug: "npm/qs"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "A Denial of Service vulnerability exists in qs up to 6.8.0 due to insufficient
  sanitization of property in the `gs.parse` function. The `merge()` function allows the
  assignment of properties on an array in the query. For any property being assigned,
  a value in the array is converted to an object containing these properties. Essentially,
  this means that the property whose expected type is Array always has to be checked
  with `Array.isArray()` by the user. This may not be obvious to the user and can cause
  unexpected behavior."
