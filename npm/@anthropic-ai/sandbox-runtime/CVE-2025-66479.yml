package_slug: "npm/@anthropic-ai/sandbox-runtime"
title: "Anthropic Sandbox Runtime Incorrectly Implemented Network Sandboxing "
description: "Due to a bug in sandboxing logic, `sandbox-runtime` did not properly
  enforce a network sandbox if the sandbox policy did not configure any allowed domains.
  This could allow sandboxed code to make network requests outside of the sandbox.
  A patch for this was released in v0.0.16.\n\nThank you to https://github.com/bendrucker
  for reporting this issue!"
