title: "Claude Code Leaks Data via Malicious Environment Configuration Before Trust
  Confirmation"
description: "A vulnerability in Claude Code's project-load flow allowed malicious
  repositories to exfiltrate data including Anthropic API keys before users confirmed
  trust. If a user started Claude Code in an attacker-controller repository, and the
  repository included a settings file that set ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL to an attacker-controlled
  endpoint, Claude Code would issue API requests before showing the trust prompt,
  including potentially leaking the user's API keys.\n\nUsers on standard Claude Code
  auto-update have received this fix already. Users performing manual updates are
  advised to update to the latest version."
