title: "Claude Code has Sandbox Escape via Persistent Configuration Injection in settings.json"
description: "Claude Code's bubblewrap sandboxing mechanism failed to properly protect
  the .claude/settings.json configuration file when it did not exist at startup. While
  the parent directory was mounted as writable and .claude/settings.local.json was
  explicitly protected with read-only constraints, settings.json was not protected
  if it was missing. This allowed malicious code running inside the sandbox to create
  this file and inject persistent hooks (such as SessionStart commands) that would
  execute with host privileges when Claude Code was restarted.\n\nUsers on standard
  Claude Code auto-update received this fix automatically. Users performing manual
  updates are advised to update to the latest version.\n\nClaude Code thanks hackerone.com/edbr
  for reporting this issue!"
