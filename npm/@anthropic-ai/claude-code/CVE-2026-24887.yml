title: "Claude Code has a Command Injection in find Command Bypasses User Approval
  Prompt"
description: "Due to an error in command parsing, it was possible to bypass the Claude
  Code confirmation prompt to trigger execution of untrusted commands through the
  find command. Reliably exploiting this required the ability to add untrusted content
  into a Claude Code context window.\n\nUsers on standard Claude Code auto-update
  have received this fix already. Users performing manual updates are advised to update
  to the latest version.\n\nClaude Code thanks https://hackerone.com/alexbernier for
  reporting this issue!"
