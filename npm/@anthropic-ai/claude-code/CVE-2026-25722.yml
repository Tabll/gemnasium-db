package_slug: "npm/@anthropic-ai/claude-code"
title: "Claude Code Vulnerable to Command Injection via Directory Change Bypasses
  Write Protection"
description: "Claude Code failed to properly validate directory changes when combined
  with write operations to protected folders. By using the `cd` command to navigate
  into sensitive directories like `.claude`, it was possible to bypass write protection
  and create or modify files without user confirmation. Reliably exploiting this required
  the ability to add untrusted content into a Claude Code context window.\n\nUsers
  on standard Claude Code auto-update received this fix automatically. Users performing
  manual updates are advised to update to the latest version.\n\nAbout\nClaude Code
  thanks hackerone.com/nil221 for reporting this issue!"
