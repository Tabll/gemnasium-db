package_slug: "npm/@anthropic-ai/claude-code"
title: "Claude Code's Permissive Default Allowlist Enables Unauthorized File Read
  and Network Exfiltration in Claude Code"
description: "Due to an overly broad allowlist of safe commands, it was possible to
  bypass the Claude Code confirmation prompts to read a file and then send file contents
  over the network without user confirmation. Reliably exploiting this requires the
  ability to add untrusted content into a Claude Code context window.\n\nUsers on
  standard Claude Code auto-update received this fix automatically after release.
  Current users of Claude Code are unaffected, as versions prior to 1.0.24 are deprecated
  and have been forced to update.\n\nThank you to https://hackerone.com/wunderwuzzi23
  for reporting this issue!"
