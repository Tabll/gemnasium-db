title: "Claude Code has Permission Deny Bypass Through Symbolic Links"
description: "Claude Code failed to strictly enforce deny rules configured in settings.json
  when accessing files through symbolic links. If a user explicitly denied Claude
  Code access to a file (such as /etc/passwd) and Claude Code had access to a symbolic
  link pointing to that file, it was possible for Claude Code to read the restricted
  file through the symlink without triggering deny rule enforcement.\n\nUsers on standard
  Claude Code auto-update received this fix automatically. Users performing manual
  updates are advised to update to the latest version.\n\nClaude Code thanks https://hackerone.com/ofirh
  for reporting this issue."
