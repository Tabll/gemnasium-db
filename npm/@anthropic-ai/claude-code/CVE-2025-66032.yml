title: "Claude Code Command Validation Bypass Allows Arbitrary Code Execution"
description: "Due to errors in parsing shell commands related to $IFS and short CLI
  flags, it was possible to bypass the Claude Code read-only validation and trigger
  arbitrary code execution. Reliably exploiting this requires the ability to add untrusted
  content into a Claude Code context window.\n\nUsers on standard Claude Code auto-update
  have received this fix already. Users performing manual updates are advised to update
  to the latest version.\n\nThank you to [RyotaK](hxxps://ryotak.net) from [GMO Flatt
  Security Inc.](hxxps://flatt.tech/en/) for reporting this issue!"
