title: "Claude Code rg vulnerability does not protect against approval prompt bypass"
description: "Due to an error in command parsing, it was possible to bypass the Claude
  Code confirmation prompt to trigger execution of an untrusted command. Reliably
  exploiting this requires the ability to add untrusted content into a Claude Code
  context window.\n\nUsers on standard Claude Code auto-update will have received
  this fix automatically. Users performing manual updates are advised to update to
  the latest version.\n\nThank you to the NVIDIA AI Red Team for reporting this issue!"
