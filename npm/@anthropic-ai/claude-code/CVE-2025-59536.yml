title: "Claude Code can execute commands prior to the startup trust dialog "
description: "Due to a bug in the startup trust dialog implementation, Claude Code
  could be tricked to execute code contained in a project before the user accepted
  the startup trust dialog. Exploiting this requires a user to start Claude Code in
  an untrusted directory.\n\nUsers on standard Claude Code auto-update will have received
  this fix automatically. Users performing manual updates are advised to update to
  the latest version.\n\nThank you to https://hackerone.com/avivdon for reporting
