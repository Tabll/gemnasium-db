title: "Claude Code permission deny bypass through symlink"
description: "Claude Code failed to account for symlinks when checking permission
  deny rules. If a user explicitly denied Claude Code access to a file and Claude
  Code had access to a symlink pointing to that file, it was possible for Claude Code
  to access the file.\n\nUsers on standard Claude Code auto-update will have received
  this fix automatically. Users performing manual updates are advised to update to
  the latest version.\n\nThank you to https://hackerone.com/vinai for reporting this
  issue!"
