title: "Claude Code vulnerable to arbitrary code execution caused by maliciously configured
  git email "
description: "At startup, Claude Code constructed a shell command that interpolated
  the value of `git config user.email` from the current workspace. If an attacker
  controlled the repositoryâ€™s Git config (e.g., via a malicious `.git/config`) and
  set `user.email` to a crafted payload, the unescaped interpolation could trigger
  arbitrary command execution **before** the user accepted the workspace-trust dialog.
  The issue affects versions prior to `1.0.105`. The fix in `1.0.105` avoids executing
  commands built from untrusted configuration and properly validates/escapes inputs.\n\n*
  \  **Patches:** Update to `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` `1.0.105` or later.\n*   **Workarounds:**
  Open only trusted workspaces and inspect repository `.git/config` before launch;
  avoid inheriting untrusted Git configuration values.\n\n> Thank you to the NVIDIA
  AI Red Team for reporting this issue!"
