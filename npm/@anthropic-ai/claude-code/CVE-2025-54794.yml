title: "Claude Code Research Preview has a Path Restriction Bypass which could allow
  unauthorized file access"
description: "Due to a path validation flaw using prefix matching instead of canonical
  path comparison, it was possible to bypass directory restrictions and access files
  outside the CWD. Successful exploitation depends on the presence of (or ability
  to create) a directory with the same prefix as the CWD and the ability to add untrusted
  content into a Claude Code context window.\n\nUsers on standard Claude Code auto-update
  received this fix automatically after release. Current users of Claude Code are
  unaffected, as versions prior to 1.0.24 are deprecated and have been forced to update.\n\nThank
  you to Elad Beber (Cymulate) for reporting this issue!"
