title: "Claude Code Vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution Due to Insufficient Startup
  Warning"
description: "When Claude Code was started in a new directory, it displayed a warning
  asking, \"Do you trust the files in this folder?\". This warning did not properly
  document that selecting \"Yes, proceed\" would allow Claude Code to execute files
  in the folder without additional confirmation. This may not have been clear to a
  user so we have updated the warning to clarify this functionality.\n\nUsers on standard
  Claude Code auto-update will have received this fix automatically. Users performing
  manual updates are advised to update to the latest version.\n\nThank you to https://hackerone.com/avivdon
  for reporting this issue!"
