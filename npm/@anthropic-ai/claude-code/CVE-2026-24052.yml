title: "Claude Code has a Domain Validation Bypass which Allows Automatic Requests
  to Attacker-Controlled Domains"
description: "Claude Code contained insufficient URL validation in its trusted domain
  verification mechanism for WebFetch requests. The application used a `startsWith()`
  function to validate trusted domains (e.g., `docs.python.org`, `modelcontextprotocol.io`),
  this could have enabled attackers to register domains like `modelcontextprotocol.io.example.com`
  that would pass validation. This could enable automatic requests to attacker-controlled
  domains without user consent, potentially leading to data exfiltration.\n\nUsers
  on standard Claude Code auto-update have received this fix already. Users performing
  manual updates are advised to update to the latest version."
