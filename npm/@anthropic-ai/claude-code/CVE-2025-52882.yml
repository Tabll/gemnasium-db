title: "Claude Code Improper Authorization via websocket connections from arbitrary
  origins"
description: "Claude Code extensions in VSCode and forks (e.g., Cursor, Windsurf,
  and VSCodium) and JetBrains IDEs (e.g., IntelliJ, Pycharm, and Android Studio) are
  vulnerable to unauthorized websocket connections from an attacker when visiting
  attacker-controlled webpages. Claude Code for VSCode IDE extensions versions 0.2.116
  through 1.0.23 are vulnerable. For Jetbrains IDE plugins, Claude Code [beta] versions
  0.1.1 through 0.1.8 are vulnerable.\n\nIn VSCode (and forks), exploitation would
  allow an attacker to read arbitrary files, see the list of files open in the IDE,
  get selection and diagnostics events from the IDE, or execute code in limited situations
  where a user has an open Jupyter Notebook and accepts a malicious prompt. In JetBrains
  IDEs, an attacker could get selection events, a list of open files, and a list of
  syntax errors.\n\n**Remediation**\n\nWe released a patch for this issue on June
  13th, 2025. Although Claude Code auto-updates when you launch it and auto-updates
  the extensions, you should take the following steps (the exact steps depend on your
  IDE).\n\n**VSCode, Cursor, Windsurf, VSCodium, and other VSCode forks**\nExtension
  Name: Claude Code for VSCode\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Open the list of Extensions
  (View->Extensions)\n2. Look for Claude Code for VSCode among installed extensions\n3.
  If you have a version < 1.0.24, click “Update” (or “Uninstall”)\n4. Restart the
  IDE\n\n**All JetBrains IDEs including IntelliJ, PyCharm, and Android Studio**\nPlugin
  name: Claude Code [Beta]\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Open the Plugins list\n2. Look for
  Claude Code [Beta] among installed extensions\n3. Update (or Uninstall) the plugin
  if the version is < 0.1.9\n4. Restart the IDE"
