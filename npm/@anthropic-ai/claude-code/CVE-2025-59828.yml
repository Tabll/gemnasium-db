title: "Claude Code Vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution via Plugin Autoloading
  with Specific Yarn Versions"
description: "In Claude Code versions prior to **1.0.39**, when the tool is used with
  **Yarn 2.x or newer (Berry)**, Yarn plugins are automatically loaded and executed
  when running `yarn --version`. In Claude Code this sequence could execute plugin
  code before the user accepts the directory trust prompt for an untrusted workspace,
  resulting in a potential arbitrary code execution path. **Yarn Classic (v1)** is
  not affected. The issue is fixed in **1.0.39**."
