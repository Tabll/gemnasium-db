package_slug: "npm/@anthropic-ai/claude-code"
title: "Claude Code Vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution via Plugin Autoloading
  with Specific Yarn Versions"
description: "When using Claude Code with Yarn installed, Yarn config files can trigger
  code execution when running `yarn --version`. This could lead to a bypass of the
  directory trust dialog in Claude Code, as plugins and `yarnPath` could be executed
  prior to the user accepting the risks of working in an untrusted directory. Users
  on standard Claude Code auto-update will have received this fix automatically. Users
  performing manual updates are advised to update to the latest version.\n\nThank
  you to Benjamin Faller, Redguard AG and Michael Hess for reporting this issue!"
