title: "Claude Code Vulnerable to Command Injection via Piped sed Command Bypasses
  File Write Restrictions"
description: "Claude Code failed to properly validate commands using piped sed operations
  with the echo command, allowing attackers to bypass file write restrictions. This
  vulnerability enabled writing to sensitive directories like the .claude folder and
  paths outside the project scope. Exploiting this required the ability to execute
  commands through Claude Code with the \"accept edits\" feature enabled.\n\nUsers
  on standard Claude Code auto-update received this fix automatically. Users performing
  manual updates are advised to update to the latest version.\n\nClaude Code thanks
  hackerone.com/nil221 for reporting this issue!"
