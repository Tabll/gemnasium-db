package_slug: "npm/underscore.deep"
title: "Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype
  Pollution')"
description: "Underscore.deep is a collection of Underscore mixins that operate on
  nested objects. Versions of `underscore.deep` prior to version 0.5.3 is vulnerable
  to a prototype pollution vulnerability. An attacker can craft a malicious payload
  and pass it to `deepFromFlat`, which would pollute any future Objects created. Any
  users that have `deepFromFlat` or `deepPick` (due to its dependency on `deepFromFlat`)
  in their code should upgrade to version 0.5.3 as soon as possible. Users unable
  to upgrade may mitigate this issue by modifying `deepFromFlat` to prevent specific
  keywords which will prevent this from happening."
