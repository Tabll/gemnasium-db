title: "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature"
description: "OpenPGP.js is a JavaScript implementation of the OpenPGP protocol. In
  affected versions OpenPGP Cleartext Signed Messages are cryptographically signed
  messages where the signed text is readable without special tools. These messages
  typically contain a \"Hash: ...\" header declaring the hash algorithm used to compute
  the signature digest. OpenPGP.js up to v5.9.0 ignored any data preceding the \"Hash:
  ...\" texts when verifying the signature. As a result, malicious parties could add
  arbitrary text to a third-party Cleartext Signed Message, to lead the victim to
  believe that the arbitrary text was signed. A user or application is vulnerable
  to said attack vector if it verifies the CleartextMessage by only checking the returned
  `verified` property, discarding the associated `data` information, and instead _visually
  trusting_ the contents of the original message. Since `verificationResult.data`
  would always contain the actual signed data, users and apps that check this information
  are not vulnerable. Similarly, given a CleartextMessage object, retrieving the data
  using `getText()` or the `text` field returns only the contents that are considered
  when verifying the signature. Finally, re-armoring a CleartextMessage object (using
  `armor()` will also result in a \"sanitised\" version, with the extraneous text
  being removed. This issue has been addressed in version 5.10.1 (current stable version)
  which will reject messages when calling `openpgp.readCleartextMessage()` and in
  version 4.10.11 (legacy version) which will will reject messages when calling `openpgp.cleartext.readArmored()`.
  Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should check the contents
  of `verificationResult.data` to see what data was actually signed, rather than visually
  trusting the contents of the armored message."
