title: "OpenPGP.js's message signature verification can be spoofed"
description: "A maliciously modified message can be passed to either `openpgp.verify`
  or `openpgp.decrypt`, causing these functions to return a valid signature verification
  result while returning data that was not actually signed.\n\nThis flaw allows signature
  verifications of inline (non-detached) signed messages (using `openpgp.verify`)
  and signed-and-encrypted messages (using `openpgp.decrypt` with `verificationKeys`)
  to be spoofed, since both functions return extracted data that may not match the
  data that was originally signed. Detached signature verifications are not affected,
  as no signed data is returned in that case.\n\nIn order to spoof a message, the
  attacker needs a single valid message signature (inline or detached) as well as
  the plaintext data that was legitimately signed, and can then construct an inline-signed
  message or signed-and-encrypted message with any data of the attacker's choice,
  which will appear as legitimately signed by affected versions of OpenPGP.js.\n\nIn
  other words. any inline-signed message can be modified to return any other data
  (while still indicating that the signature was valid), and the same is true for
  signed+encrypted messages if the attacker can obtain a valid signature and encrypt
  a new message (of the attacker's choice) together with that signature.\n\nBoth OpenPGP.js
  v6 and v5 are affected. OpenPGP.js v4 is not affected."
