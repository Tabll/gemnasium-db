identifier: "GMS-2018-6"
package_slug: "npm/lactate"
title: "Directory Traversal"
description: "A crafted GET request can be leveraged to traverse the directory structure
  of a host using the `lactate` web server package, and request arbitrary files outside
  of the specified web root. This allows for a remote attacker to gain access to arbitrary
  files on the filesystem that the process has access to read. Mitigating factors:
  Only files that the user running `lactate` has permission to read will be accessible
  via this vulnerability."
