title: "The Thinbus Javascript Secure Remote Password (SRP) Client Generates Fewer
  Bits of Entropy Than Intended"
description: "A protocol compliance bug in thinbus-srp-npm versions prior to 2.0.1
  causes the client to generate a fixed 252 bits of entropy instead of the intended
  bit length of the safe prime (defaulted to 2048 bits). RFC 5054 states in section
  [2.5.4 Client Key Exchange ](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5054#section-2.5.4)\n\n>
  The client key exchange message carries the client's public value\n(A).  The client
  calculates this value as A = g^a % N, where a is a\nrandom number that SHOULD be
  at least 256 bits in length.\n\nThe client public value is being generated from
  a private value that is 4 bits below the specification. This reduces the protocol's
  designed security margin it is now practically exploitable. The servers full sized
  2048 bit random number is used to create the shared session key and password proof."
