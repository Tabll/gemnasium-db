identifier: "CVE-2018-20164"
package_slug: "npm/uap-core"
title: "ReDoS"
description: "The programming library UA-Parser uses regular expressions to identify
  user agent strings. The complexity of some of the regular expressions is such that
  an attacker can craft special patterns that keep the server busy for a long time.
  By sending many requests in short order, an attacker can exhaust the amount of processing
  power available."
