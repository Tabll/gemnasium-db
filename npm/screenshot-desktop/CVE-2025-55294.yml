title: "screenshot-desktop vulnerable to command Injection via `format` option"
description: "This vulnerability is a **command injection** issue.\nWhen user-controlled
  input is passed into the `format` option of the screenshot function, it is interpolated
  into a shell command without sanitization.\nAn attacker can craft malicious input
  such as:\n\n{ format: \"; echo vulnerable > /tmp/hello;\" }\n\nThis results in arbitrary
  command execution with the privileges of the calling process.\n\n**Who is impacted:**\nAny
  application that accepts untrusted input and forwards it directly (or indirectly)
  into the `format` option is affected. If the library is used in a server-side context
  (e.g., API endpoints, web services), attackers may be able to exploit this **remotely
  and without authentication**, leading to full compromise of confidentiality, integrity,
  and availability.\n\n**CVSS v3.1 Base Score:** 9.8 (Critical)\n`CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`"
