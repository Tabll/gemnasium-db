identifiers:
- "CVE-2021-42740"
package_slug: "npm/shell-quote"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')"
description: "The shell-quote package for Node.js allows command injection. An attacker
  can inject unescaped shell metacharacters through a regex designed to support Windows
  drive letters. If the output of this package is passed to a real shell as a quoted
  argument to a command with exec(), an attacker can inject arbitrary commands. This
  is because the Windows drive letter regex character class is {A-z] instead of the
  correct {A-Za-z]. Several shell metacharacters exist in the space between capital
  letter Z case letter a, such as the backtick character."
