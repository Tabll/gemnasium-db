package_slug: "npm/shell-quote"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command in Shell-quote"
description: "The shell-quote package before 1.7.3 for Node.js allows command injection.
  An attacker can inject unescaped shell metacharacters through a regex designed to
  support Windows drive letters. If the output of this package is passed to a real
  shell as a quoted argument to a command with `exec()`, an attacker can inject arbitrary
  commands. This is because the Windows drive letter regex character class is `[A-z]`
  instead of the correct `[A-Za-z]`. Several shell metacharacters exist in the space
  between capital letter Z and lower case letter a, such as the backtick character."
