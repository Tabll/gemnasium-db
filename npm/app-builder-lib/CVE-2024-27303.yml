package_slug: "npm/app-builder-lib"
title: "electron-builder's NSIS installer - execute arbitrary code on the target machine
  (Windows only)"
description: "### Impact\nWindows-Only: The NSIS installer makes a system call to
  open cmd.exe via NSExec in the `.nsh` installer script. NSExec by default searches
  the current directory of where the installer is located before searching `PATH`.
  This means that if an attacker can place a malicious executable file named cmd.exe
  in the same folder as the installer, the installer will run the malicious file.\n\n###
  Patches\nFixed in https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/pull/8059\n\n###
  Workarounds\nNone, it executes at the installer-level before the app is present
  on the system, so there's no way to check if it exists in a current installer.\n\n###
