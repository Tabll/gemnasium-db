title: "DOM Clobbering Gadget found in rollup bundled scripts that leads to XSS"
description: "A DOM Clobbering vulnerability was discovered in rollup when bundling
  scripts that use `import.meta.url` or with plugins that emit and reference asset
  files from code  in `cjs`/`umd`/`iife` format. The DOM Clobbering gadget can lead
  to cross-site scripting (XSS) in web pages where scriptless attacker-controlled
  HTML elements (e.g., an `img` tag with an unsanitized `name` attribute) are present.\n\nIt's
  worth noting that similar issues in other popular bundlers like Webpack ([CVE-2024-43788](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/security/advisories/GHSA-4vvj-4cpr-p986))
  have been reported, which might serve as a good reference."
