package_slug: "npm/dompurify"
title: "DOMPurify allows tampering by prototype pollution"
description: "It has been discovered that malicious HTML using special nesting techniques
  can bypass the depth checking added to DOMPurify in recent releases. It was also
  possible to use Prototype Pollution to weaken the depth check.\n\nThis renders dompurify
  unable to avoid XSS attack.\n\nFixed by https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/commit/1e520262bf4c66b5efda49e2316d6d1246ca7b21
  (3.x branch) and https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/commit/26e1d69ca7f769f5c558619d644d90dd8bf26ebc
  (2.x branch)."
