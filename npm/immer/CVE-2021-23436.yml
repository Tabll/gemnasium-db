identifier: "CVE-2021-23436"
package_slug: "npm/immer"
title: "Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type (Type Confusion)"
description: "A type confusion vulnerability can lead to a bypass of 
  CVE-2020-28477 when the user-provided keys used in the path parameter are arrays. 
  In particular, this bypass is possible because the condition 
  `(p === \"__proto__\" || p === \"constructor\")` in `applyPatches_` returns false 
  if `p` is `['__proto__']` (or `['constructor']`). The `===` operator (strict 
  equality operator) returns false if the operands have different type."
