title: "Malicious Package"
description: "All versions of `arsenic-tabasco-cyborg-peanut-butter` contain malicious
  code. The package downloads and runs a script that opens a reverse shell in the
  system. Any computer that has this package installed or running should be considered
  fully compromised. All secrets and keys stored on that computer should be rotated
  immediately from a different computer.\n\nThe package should be removed, but as
  full control of the computer may have been given to an outside entity, there is
  no guarantee that removing the package will remove all malicious software resulting
  from installing it."
