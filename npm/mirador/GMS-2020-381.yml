title: "Potential XSS in jQuery dependency in Mirador"
description: "### Impact\nMirador users less than v3.0.0 (alpha-rc) versions that
  have an unpatched jQuery. When adopters update jQuery they will find some of Mirador
  functionality to be broken.\n\n### Patches\nMirador adopters should update to v3.0.0,
  no updates exist for v2.x releases.\n\n### Workarounds\nYes, Mirador users could
  fork and create their own custom build of Mirador and make the bug fixes themselves.\n\n###
