title: "Prototype Pollution in sahmat"
description: "All versions of `sahmat ` are vulnerable to prototype pollution. The
  package does not restrict the modification of an Object's prototype, which may allow
  an attacker to add or modify an existing property that will exist on all objects.
  \n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative
  package until a fix is made available."
