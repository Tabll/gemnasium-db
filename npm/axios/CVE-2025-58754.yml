package_slug: "npm/axios"
title: "Axios is vulnerable to DoS attack through lack of data size check"
description: "When Axios runs on Node.js and is given a URL with the `data:` scheme,
  it does not perform HTTP. Instead, its Node http adapter decodes the entire payload
  into memory (`Buffer`/`Blob`) and returns a synthetic 200 response.\nThis path ignores
  `maxContentLength` / `maxBodyLength` (which only protect HTTP responses), so an
  attacker can supply a very large `data:` URI and cause the process to allocate unbounded
  memory and crash (DoS), even if the caller requested `responseType: 'stream'`."
