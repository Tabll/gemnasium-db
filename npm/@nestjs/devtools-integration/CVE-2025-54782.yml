title: "@nestjs/devtools-integration: CSRF to Sandbox Escape Allows for RCE against
  JS Developers"
description: "A critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability was discovered
  in the `@nestjs/devtools-integration` package. When enabled, the package exposes
  a local development HTTP server with an API endpoint that uses an unsafe JavaScript
  sandbox (`safe-eval`-like implementation). Due to improper sandboxing and missing
  cross-origin protections, any malicious website visited by a developer can execute
  arbitrary code on their local machine.\n\nA full blog post about how this vulnerability
  was uncovered can be found on [Socket's blog](https://socket.dev/blog/nestjs-rce-vuln)."
