title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "CKEditor 5 is a JavaScript rich text editor. A cross-site scripting
  vulnerability has been discovered affecting three optional CKEditor 5's packages
  in versions prior to 35.0.1. The vulnerability allowed to trigger a JavaScript code
  after fulfilling special conditions. The affected packages are `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-markdown-gfm`,
  `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-html-support`, and `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-html-embed`. The specific
  conditions are 1) Using one of the affected packages. In case of `ckeditor5-html-support`
  and `ckeditor5-html-embed`, additionally, it was required to use a configuration
  that allows unsafe markup inside the editor. 2) Destroying the editor instance and
  3) Initializing the editor on an element and using an element other than `<textarea>`
  as a base. The root cause of the issue was a mechanism responsible for updating
  the source element with the markup coming from the CKEditor 5 data pipeline after
  destroying the editor. This vulnerability might affect a small percent of integrators
  that depend on dynamic editor initialization/destroy and use Markdown, General HTML
  Support or HTML embed features. The problem has been recognized and patched. The
  fix is available in version 35.0.1. There are no known workarounds for this issue."
