description: "Versions of the package chromedriver before 119.0.1 is vulnerable to
  Command Injection when setting the chromedriver.path to an arbitrary system binary.
  This could lead to unauthorized access and potentially malicious actions on the
  host system.\r\r**Note:**\r\rAn attacker must have access to the system running
  the vulnerable chromedriver library to exploit it. The success of exploitation also
  depends on the permissions and privileges of the process running chromedriver."
