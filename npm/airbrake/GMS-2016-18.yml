title: "Insecure Default Configuration"
description: "The airbrake module defaults to sending environment variables over HTTP.
  Environment variables can often times contain secret keys and other sensitive values.
  A malicious user could be on the same network as a regular user and intercept all
  the secret keys the user is sending. This goes against common best practice, which
  is to use HTTPS."
