package_slug: "npm/airbrake"
title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "The airbrake module 0.3.8 and earlier defaults to sending environment
  variables over HTTP. Environment variables can often times contain secret keys and
  other sensitive values. A malicious user could be on the same network as a regular
  user and intercept all the secret keys the user is sending. This goes against common
  best practice, which is to use HTTPS."
