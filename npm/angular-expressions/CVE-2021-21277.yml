identifier: "CVE-2021-21277"
package_slug: "npm/angular-expressions"
title: "Injection Vulnerability"
description: "In angular-expressions there is a vulnerability which allows Remote
  Code Execution if you call `expressions.compile(userControlledInput)` where \"userControlledInput\"
  is text that comes from user input. The security of the package could be bypassed
  by using a more complex payload, using a `constructor.constructor` technique. In
  terms of impact: If running angular-expressions in the browser, an attacker could
  run any browser script when the application code calls `expressions.compile(userControlledInput)`.
  If running angular-expressions on the server, an attacker could run any Javascript
  expression, thus gaining Remote Code Execution. This is fixed of angular-expressions
  A temporary workaround might be either to disable user-controlled input that will
  be fed into angular-expressions in your application or allow only following characters
  in the `userControlledInput`."
