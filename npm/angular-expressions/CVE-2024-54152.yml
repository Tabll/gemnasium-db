title: "Angular Expressions - Remote Code Execution when using locals"
description: "An attacker can write a malicious expression that escapes the sandbox
  to execute arbitrary code on the system.\n\nExample of vulnerable code:\n\n```js\nconst
  expressions = require(\"angular-expressions\");\nconst result = expressions.compile(\"__proto__.constructor\")({},
  {});\n// result should be undefined, however for versions <=1.4.2, it returns an
  object.\n```\n\nWith a more complex (undisclosed) payload, one can get full access
  to Arbitrary code execution on the system."
