package_slug: "npm/tarteaucitronjs"
title: "tarteaucitron.js allows UI manipulation via unrestricted CSS injection"
description: "A vulnerability was identified in `tarteaucitron.js`, where user-controlled
  inputs for element dimensions (`width` and `height`) were not properly validated.
  This allowed an attacker with direct access to the site's source code or a CMS plugin
  to set values like `100%;height:100%;position:fixed;`, potentially covering the
  entire viewport and facilitating clickjacking attacks."
