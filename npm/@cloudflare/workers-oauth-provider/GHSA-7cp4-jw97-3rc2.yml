title: "Duplicate Advisory: @cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider missing validation
  of redirect_uri on authorize endpoint"
description: "# Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-4pc9-x2fx-p7vj. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n# Original Description\nThe OAuth implementation in workers-oauth-provider
  that is part of  MCP framework https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-mcp , did not
  correctly validate that redirect_uri was on the allowed list of redirect URIs for
  the given client registration.\n\nFixed in:  https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/26
  https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/26 \n\nImpact:\n\n \n\nUnder
  certain circumstances (see below), if a victim had previously authorized with a
  server built on workers-oath-provider, and an attacker could later trick the victim
  into visiting a malicious web site, then attacker could potentially steal the victim's
  credentials to the same OAuth server and subsequently impersonate them.\n\nIn order
  for the attack to be possible, the OAuth server's authorized callback must be designed
  to auto-approve authorizations that appear to come from an OAuth client that the
  victim has authorized previously. The authorization flow is not implemented by workers-oauth-provider;
  it is up to the application built on top to decide whether to implement such automatic
  re-authorization. However, many applications do implement such logic.\n\nNote: It
  is a basic, well-known requirement that OAuth servers should verify that the redirect
  URI is among the allowed list for the client, both during the authorization flow
  and subsequently when exchanging the authorization code for an access token. workers-oauth-provider
  implemented only the latter check, not the former. Unfortunately, the former is
  the much more important check. Readers who are familiar with OAuth may recognize
  that failing to check redirect URIs against the allowed list is a well-known, basic
  mistake, covered extensively in the RFC and elsewhere. The author of this library
  would like everyone to know that he was, in fact, well-aware of this requirement,
  thought about it a lot while designing the library, and then, somehow, forgot to
  actually make sure the check was in the code. That is, it's not that he didn't know
  what he was doing, it's that he knew what he was doing but flubbed it."
