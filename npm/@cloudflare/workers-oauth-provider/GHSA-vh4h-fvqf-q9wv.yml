title: "Duplicate Advisory: @cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider PKCE bypass via downgrade
  attack"
description: "# Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-qgp8-v765-qxx9. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n# Original Description\nPKCE was implemented in the OAuth implementation
  in workers-oauth-provider that is part of  MCP framework https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-mcp
  . However, it was found that an attacker could cause the check to be skipped.\n\n\nFixed
  in:\n\n \n\n https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/27 https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/27
  \n\n\nImpact: \n\nPKCE is a defense-in-depth mechanism against certain kinds of
  attacks and was an optional extension in OAuth 2.0 which became required in the
  OAuth 2.1 draft. (Note that the MCP specification requires OAuth 2.1.). This bug
  completely bypasses PKCE protection."
