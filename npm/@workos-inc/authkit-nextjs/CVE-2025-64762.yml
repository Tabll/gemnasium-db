title: "authkit-nextjs may let session cookies be cached in CDNs"
description: "In `authkit-nextjs` version 2.11.0 and below, authenticated responses
  do not defensively apply anti-caching headers. In environments where CDN caching
  is enabled, this can result in session tokens being included in cached responses
  and subsequently served to multiple users.\n\nNext.js applications deployed on Vercel
  are unaffected **unless** they manually enable CDN caching by setting cache headers
  on authenticated paths."
