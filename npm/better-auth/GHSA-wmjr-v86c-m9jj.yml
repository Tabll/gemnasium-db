title: "Better Auth's multi-session sign-out hook allows forged cookies to revoke
  arbitrary sessions"
description: "A vulnerability was identified in the multi-session plugin for Better
  Auth, specifically in the /sign-out after-hook. The hook trusts raw multi-session
  cookies and forwards the extracted values directly to internalAdapter.deleteSessions
  without verifying the cookie signature. Because cookie values are not validated
  with getSignedCookie (or any equivalent check), an attacker can supply a forged
  _multi-* cookie to trigger deletion of arbitrary session tokens."
