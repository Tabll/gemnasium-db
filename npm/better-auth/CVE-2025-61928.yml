title: "Better Auth: Unauthenticated API key creation through api-key plugin"
description: "A critical authentication bypass was identified in the API key creation
  and update endpoints. An attacker could create or modify API keys for arbitrary
  users by supplying a victim’s user ID in the request body. Due to a flaw in how
  the authenticated user was derived, the endpoints could treat attacker-controlled
  input as an authenticated user object under certain conditions."
