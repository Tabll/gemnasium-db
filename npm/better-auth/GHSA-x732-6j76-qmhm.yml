title: "Better Auth's rou3 Dependency has Double-Slash Path Normalization which can
  Bypass disabledPaths Config and Rate Limits"
description: "An issue in the underlying router library **rou3** can cause `/path`
  and `//path` to be treated as identical routes. If your environment does **not**
  normalize incoming URLs (e.g., by collapsing multiple slashes), this can allow bypasses
  of `disabledPaths` and path-based rate limits."
