title: "HMAC-SHA1 signatures can bypass validation via key confusion"
description: "### Impact\nAn attacker can inject an HMAC-SHA1 signature that is valid
  using only knowledge of the RSA public key. This allows bypassing signature validation.\n\n###
  Patches\n has the fix.\n\n### Workarounds\nThe recommendation is to upgrade. In
