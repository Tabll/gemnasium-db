title: "xml-crypto Vulnerable to XML Signature Verification Bypass via DigestValue
  Comment"
description: "An attacker may be able to exploit this vulnerability to bypass authentication
  or authorization mechanisms in systems that rely on xml-crypto for verifying signed
  XML documents. The vulnerability allows an attacker to modify a valid signed XML
  message in a way that still passes signature verification checks. For example, it
  could be used to alter critical identity or access control attributes, enabling
  an attacker to escalate privileges or impersonate another user."
