title: "xml-crypto Vulnerable to XML Signature Verification Bypass via Multiple SignedInfo
  References"
description: "An attacker may be able to exploit this vulnerability to bypass authentication
  or authorization mechanisms in systems that rely on xml-crypto for verifying signed
  XML documents. The vulnerability allows an attacker to modify a valid signed XML
  message in a way that still passes signature verification checks. For example, it
  could be used to alter critical identity or access control attributes, enabling
  an attacker with a valid account to escalate privileges or impersonate another user."
