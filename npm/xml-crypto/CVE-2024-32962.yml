package_slug: "npm/xml-crypto"
title: "xml-crypto vulnerable to XML signature verification bypass due improper verification
  of signature/signature spoofing"
description: "Default configuration does not check authorization of the signer, it
  only checks the validity of the signature per section 3.2.2 of https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xmldsig-core-20080610/#sec-CoreValidation.
  As such, without additional validation steps, the default configuration allows a
  malicious actor to re-sign an XML document, place the certificate in a `<KeyInfo
  />` element, and pass `xml-crypto` default validation checks."
