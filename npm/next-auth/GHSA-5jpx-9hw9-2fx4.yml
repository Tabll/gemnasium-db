title: "NextAuthjs Email misdelivery Vulnerability"
description: "NextAuth.js's email sign-in can be forced to deliver authentication
  emails to an attacker-controlled mailbox due to a bug in `nodemailer`'s address
  parser used by the project (fixed in `nodemailer` **v7.0.7**). A crafted input such
  as:\n\n```\n\"e@attacker.com\"@victim.com\n```\n\nis parsed incorrectly and results
  in the message being delivered to `e@attacker.com` (attacker) instead of `\"<e@attacker.com>@victim.com\"`
  (the intended recipient at `victim.com`) in violation of RFC 5321/5322 semantics.
  This allows an attacker to receive login/verification links or other sensitive emails
  intended for the victim.\n\n<h2>Affected NextAuthjs Version</h2>\n\n≤ Version |
