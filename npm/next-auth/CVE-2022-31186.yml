package_slug: "npm/next-auth"
title: "Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File"
description: "NextAuth.js is a complete open source authentication solution for Next.js
  applications. An information disclosure vulnerability in `next-auth` before `v4.10.2`
  and `v3.29.9` allows an attacker with log access privilege to obtain excessive information
  such as an identity provider's secret in the log (which is thrown during OAuth error
  handling) and use it to leverage further attacks on the system, like impersonating
  the client to ask for extensive permissions. This issue has been patched in `v4.10.2`
  and `v3.29.9` by moving the log for `provider` information to the debug level. In
  addition, we added a warning for having the `debug: true` option turned on in production.
  If for some reason you cannot upgrade, you can user the `logger` configuration option
  by sanitizing the logs."
