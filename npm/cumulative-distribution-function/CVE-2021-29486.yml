identifier: "CVE-2021-29486"
package_slug: "npm/cumulative-distribution-function"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "cumulative-distribution-function is an open source npm library used
  which calculates statistical cumulative distribution function from data array of
  x values. Applications using this library on improper data may crash or go into
  an infinite-loop. In the case of a nodejs server-app using this library to act on
  invalid non-numeric data, the nodejs server may crash. This may affect other users
  of this server and/or require the server to be rebooted for proper operation. In
  the case of a browser app using this library to act on invalid non-numeric data,
  that browser may crash or lock up. A flaw enabling an infinite-loop was discovered
  in the code for evaluating the cumulative-distribution-function of input data. Although
  the documentation explains that numeric data is required, some users may confuse
  an array of strings like `[\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\"]` for numeric data [1,2,3,4,5]
  when it is in fact string data. An infinite loop is possible when the cumulative-distribution-function
  is evaluated for a given point when the input data is string data rather than type
  `number`. The vulnerability could also manifest if a data source to be analyzed
  changes data type from Arrays of number (proper) to Arrays of string (invalid, but
  undetected by earlier version of the library)."
