package_slug: "npm/muhammara"
title: "Unchecked Return Value to NULL Pointer Dereference"
description: "Muhammara is a node module with c/cpp bindings to modify PDF with JavaScript
  for node or electron. The package muhammara before 2.6.2 and from 3.0.0 and before
  3.3.0, as well as all versions of muhammara's predecessor package hummus, is vulnerable
  to Denial of Service (DoS) when supplied with a maliciously crafted PDF file to
  be parsed. The issue has been patched in muhammara version 3.4.0 and the fix has
  been backported to version 2.6.2. As a workaround, do not process files from untrusted
  sources. If using hummus, replace the package with muhammara."
