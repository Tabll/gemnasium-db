title: "Entropy Backdoor in text-qrcode"
description: "All versions of `text-qrcode` contain malicious code that overwrites
  the `randomBytes` method for the `crypto` module with a function that generates
  weak entropy. Instead of generating bytes, the infected randomBytes will generate
  3 bytes of entropy and hash them, resulting in a byte value being returned, but
  one that is easily guessable. Uninstall `text-qrcode` immediately. If the module
  was used to generate entropy that is load bearing, all such instances of generated
  entropy must be replaced. This includes things like bitcoin wallets, private keys,
  encrypted messages, etc."
