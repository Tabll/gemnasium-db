title: "@saltcorn/server arbitrary file and directory listing when accessing build
  mobile app results"
description: "A user with admin permission can read arbitrary file and directory names
  on the filesystem by calling the `admin/build-mobile-app/result?build_dir_name=`
  endpoint.  The `build_dir_name` parameter is not properly validated and it's then
  used to construct the `buildDir` that is read. The file/directory names under the
  `buildDir` will be returned."
