title: "Saltcorn's Reflected XSS and Command Injection vulnerabilities can be chained
  for 1-click-RCE"
description: "1. There is a reflected XSS vulnerability in the GET /admin/edit-codepage/:name
  route through the name parameter. This can be used to hijack the session of an admin
  if they click a specially crafted link.\n2. Additionally, there is a Command Injection
  vulnerability in GET /admin/backup. The admin can inject a shell command in the
  backup password which is inserted in the command used to create the backup zip.\n\n\nBoth
  vulnerabilities can be chained to craft a malicious link which will execute an arbitrary
  shell command on the server if it is clicked by a saltcorn admin with an active
  session. I believe iframes could also be used to exploit this silently when the
  admin visits an attacker-controlled web page (though I have not tested that)."
