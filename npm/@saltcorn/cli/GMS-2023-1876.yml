title: "Unsafe plugins can be installed via pack import by tenant admins"
description: "### Summary\nUnsafe plugins (for instance `sql-list`) can be installed
  in subdomain tenants via pack import even if unsafe plugin installation for tenants
  is disables\n\n### Details\nI have an example\nhttps://bot20230704.saltcorn.com/view/all_plugins\nIt's
  publicly accessible (but has not so secure values except list of tenants).\nBut
  using this mech one can read **any** data from other tenants.\n\n### Impact\nAll
  tenants of installation (i.e. `saltcorn.com`), can be compromised from tenant user
  has admin access. If an untrusted user has admin rights to a tenant instance, they
  will be able to install a plug-in that can access information from other tenants"
