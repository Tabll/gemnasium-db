identifier: "CVE-2021-21413"
package_slug: "npm/isolated-vm"
title: "Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources"
description: "isolated-vm has API pitfalls which may make
  it easy for implementers to expose supposed secure isolates to the permissions of
  the main nodejs isolate. Reference objects allow access to the underlying reference's
  full prototype chain. In an environment where the implementer has exposed a Reference
  instance to an attacker they would be able to use it to acquire a Reference to the
  nodejs context's Function object. Similar application-specific attacks could be
  possible by modifying the local prototype of other API objects. Access to NativeModule
  objects could allow an attacker to load and run native code from anywhere on the
  filesystem."
