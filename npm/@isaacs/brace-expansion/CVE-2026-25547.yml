package_slug: "npm/@isaacs/brace-expansion"
title: "@isaacs/brace-expansion has Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "`@isaacs/brace-expansion` is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS)
  issue caused by unbounded brace range expansion. When an attacker provides a pattern
  containing repeated numeric brace ranges, the library attempts to eagerly generate
  every possible combination synchronously. Because the expansion grows exponentially,
  even a small input can consume excessive CPU and memory and may crash the Node.js
  process."
