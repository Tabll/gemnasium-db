identifier: "CVE-2020-15135"
package_slug: "npm/save-server"
title: "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
description: "save-server is affected by a CSRF vulnerability, as there is no CSRF
  mitigation (Tokens etc.). The CSRF attack would require you to navigate to a malicious
  site while you have an active session with Save-Server (Session key stored in cookies).
  The malicious user would then be able to perform some actions, including uploading/deleting
  files and adding redirects. If you are logged in as root, this attack is significantly
  more severe. They can in addition create, delete and update users. If they updated
  the password of a user, that user's files would then be available. If the root password
  is updated, all files would be visible if they logged in with the new password."
