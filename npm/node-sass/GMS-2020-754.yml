title: "Denial of Service in node-sass"
description: "Affected versions of `node-sass` are vulnerable to Denial of Service
  (DoS). Crafted objects passed to the `renderSync` function may trigger C++ assertions
  in `CustomImporterBridge::get_importer_entry` and `CustomImporterBridge::post_process_return_value`
  that crash the Node process. This may allow attackers to crash the system's running
  Node process and lead to Denial of Service.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to
  version 4.13.1 or later"
