title: "Cross-Site Scripting in jquery-mobile"
description: "All version of `jquery-mobile` are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting.
  The package checks for content in `location.hash` and if a URL is found it does
  an XmlHttpRequest (XHR) to the URL and renders the response with `innerHTML`. It
  fails to validate the `Content-Type` of the response, allowing attackers to include
  malicious payloads as part of query parameters that are reflected back to the user.
  A response such as `{\"q\":\"<iframe/src='javascript:alert(1)'></iframe>\",\"results\":[]}`
  would be parsed as HTML and the JavaScript payload executed. No fix is currently
  available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available."
