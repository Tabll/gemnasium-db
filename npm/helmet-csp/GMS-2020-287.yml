title: "Configuration Override in helmet-csp"
description: "Versions of `helmet-csp` before to are vulnerable to a Configuration
  Override affecting the application's Content Security Policy (CSP). The package's
  browser sniffing for Firefox deletes the `default-src` CSP policy, which is the
  fallback policy. This allows an attacker to remove an application's default CSP,
  possibly rendering the application vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting. Upgrade to
  or later. Setting the `browserSniff` configuration to `false` in vulnerable versions
  also mitigates the issue."
