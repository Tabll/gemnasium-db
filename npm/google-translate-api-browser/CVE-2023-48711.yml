package_slug: "npm/google-translate-api-browser"
title: "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
description: "google-translate-api-browser is an npm package which interfaces with
  the google translate web api. A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Vulnerability
  is present in applications utilizing the `google-translate-api-browser` package
  and exposing the `translateOptions` to the end user. An attacker can set a malicious
  `tld`, causing the application to return unsafe URLs pointing towards local resources.
  The `translateOptions.tld` field is not properly sanitized before being placed in
  the Google translate URL. This can allow an attacker with control over the `translateOptions`
  to set the `tld` to a payload such as `@127.0.0.1`. This causes the full URL to
  become `https://translate.google.@127.0.0.1/...`, where `translate.google.` is the
  username used to connect to localhost. An attacker can send requests within internal
  networks and the local host. Should any HTTPS application be present on the internal
  network with a vulnerability exploitable via a GET call, then it would be possible
  to exploit this using this vulnerability. This issue has been addressed in release
  version 4.1.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for
  this vulnerability."
