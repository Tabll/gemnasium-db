title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')"
description: "Versions of the package git-commit-info before 2.0.2 is vulnerable to
  Command Injection such that the package-exported method gitCommitInfo () fails to
  sanitize its parameter commit, which later flows into a sensitive command execution
  API. As a result, attackers may inject malicious commands once they control the
  hash content."
