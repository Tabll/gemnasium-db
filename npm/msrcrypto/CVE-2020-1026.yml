title: "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature"
description: "A Security Feature Bypass vulnerability exists in the MSR JavaScript
  Cryptography Library that is caused by multiple bugs in the libraryâ€™s Elliptic
  Curve Cryptography (ECC) implementation.An attacker could potentially abuse these
  bugs to learn information about a serverâ€™s private ECC key (a key leakage attack)
  or craft an invalid ECDSA signature that nevertheless passes as valid. The security
  update addresses the vulnerability by fixing the bugs disclosed in the ECC implementation,
  aka 'MSR JavaScript Cryptography Library Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability'."
