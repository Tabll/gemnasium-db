title: "Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions"
description: "Feathersjs is a framework for creating web APIs and real-time applications
  with TypeScript or JavaScript. Feathers socket handler does not catch invalid string
  conversion errors like `const message = ${{ toString: '' }}` which would cause the
  NodeJS process to crash when sending an unexpected Socket.io message like `socket.emit('find',
  { toString: '' })`. A fix has been released in versions 5.0.8 and 4.5.18. Users
  are advised to upgrade. There is no known workaround for this vulnerability."
