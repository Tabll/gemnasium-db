package_slug: "npm/@apeleghq/asn1-der"
title: "ts-asn1-der has Incorrect DER Encoding of Numbers Leading to Denial of Service
  and Incorrect Value Representation"
description: "Incorrect `number` DER encoding can lead to denial on service for absolute
  values in the range `2**31` -- `2**32 - 1`. The arithmetic in the `numBitLen` didn't
  take into account that values in this range could result in a negative result upon
  applying the `>>` operator, leading to an infinite loop.\n\nIn addition, `number`
  encoding had a few other issues that resulted it in it not encoding values correctly."
