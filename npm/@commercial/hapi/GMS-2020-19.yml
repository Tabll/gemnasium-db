description: "Affected versions of `@commercial/hapi` are vulnerable to Denial of
  Service. The CORS request handler has a vulnerability which will cause the function
  to throw a system error if the header contains some invalid values. If no unhandled
  exception handler is available, the application will exist, allowing an attacker
  to shut down services."
