package_slug: "npm/sysend"
title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "sysend.js is a library that allows a user to send messages between pages
  that are open in the same browser. Users that use cross-origin communication may
  have their communications intercepted. Impact is limited by the communication occurring
  in the same browser. This issue has been patched in sysend.js version 1.10.0. The
  only currently known workaround is to avoid sending communications that a user does
  not want to have intercepted via sysend messages."
