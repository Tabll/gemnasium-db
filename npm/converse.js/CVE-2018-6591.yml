identifier: "CVE-2018-6591"
package_slug: "npm/converse.js"
title: "Information Exposure"
description: "Converse.js and Inverse.js allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive
  information because it is too difficult to determine whether safe publication of
  private data was configured or even intended. For example, users might have an expectation
  that chatroom bookmarks are private, but the various interacting software components
  do not necessarily make that happen."
