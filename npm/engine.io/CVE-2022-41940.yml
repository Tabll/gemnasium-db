title: "Uncaught Exception"
description: "Engine.IO is the implementation of transport-based cross-browser/cross-device
  bi-directional communication layer for Socket.IO. A specially crafted HTTP request
  can trigger an uncaught exception on the Engine.IO server, thus killing the Node.js
  process. This impacts all the users of the engine.io package, including those who
  uses depending packages like socket.io. There is no known workaround except upgrading
  to a safe version. There are patches for this issue released in versions 3.6.1 and
  6.2.1."
