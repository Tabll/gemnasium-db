package_slug: "npm/react-native-mmkv"
title: "Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File"
description: "react-native-mmkv is a library that allows easy use of MMKV inside React
  Native applications. Before version 2.11.0, the react-native-mmkv logged the optional
  encryption key for the MMKV database into the Android system log. The key can be
  obtained by anyone with access to the Android Debugging Bridge (ADB) if it is enabled
  in the phone settings. This bug is not present on iOS devices. By logging the encryption
  secret to the system logs, attackers can trivially recover the secret by enabling
  ADB and undermining an app's thread model. This issue has been patched in version
  2.11.0."
