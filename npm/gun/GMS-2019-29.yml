title: "High severity vulnerability that affects gun"
description: "## Urgent Upgrade\n\nThe static file server module included with GUN
  had a **serious vulnerability**:\n\n - Using `curl --path-as-is` allowed reads on
  any parent directory or files.\n\nThis did not work via the browser or via curl
  without as-is option.\n\n ### Fixed\n\nThis has been fixed since version `0.2019.416`
  and higher.\n\n ### Who Was Effected?\n\nMost NodeJS users who use the default setup,
  such as:\n\n - `npm start`\n - `node examples/http.js`\n - `Heroku` 1-click-deploy\n
  - `Docker`\n - `Now`\n\nIf you have a custom NodeJS code then you are probably safe
  *unless* you have something like `require('http').createServer(Gun.serve(__dirname))`
  in it.\n\nIf you have not upgraded, it is **mandatory** or else it is highly likely
  your environment variables and AWS (or other) keys could be leaked.\n\n ### Credit\n\nIt
  was reported and fixed by [JK0N](https://github.com/amark/gun/pull/527), but I did
  not understand the `--path-as-is` condition.\n\nJoonas Loppi from [function61](http://function61.com)
  rediscovered it and explained the urgency to me to fix it.\n"
