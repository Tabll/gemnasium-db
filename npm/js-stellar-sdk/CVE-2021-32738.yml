identifier: "CVE-2021-32738"
package_slug: "npm/js-stellar-sdk"
title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "js-stellar-sdk is a Javascript library for communicating with a Stellar
  Horizon server. The `Utils.readChallengeTx` function used in SEP-10 Stellar Web
  Authentication states in its function documentation that it reads and validates
  the challenge transaction including verifying that the `serverAccountID` has signed
  the transaction. In js-stellar-sdk, the function does not verify that the server
  has signed the transaction. Applications that also used `Utils.verifyChallengeTxThreshold`
  or `Utils.verifyChallengeTxSigners` to verify the signatures including the server
  signature on the challenge transaction are unaffected as those functions verify
  the server signed the transaction. Applications calling `Utils.readChallengeTx`
  should update to, the first version with a patch for this vulnerability, to ensure
  that the challenge transaction is completely valid and signed by the server creating
  the challenge transaction."
