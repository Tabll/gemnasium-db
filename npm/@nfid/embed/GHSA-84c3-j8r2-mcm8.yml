title: "@nfid/embed has compromised private key due to @dfinity/auth-client producing
  insecure session keys"
description: "### Problem\nUser sessions in the @nfid/embed SDK with Ed25519 keys
  are vulnerable due to a compromised private key `535yc-uxytb-gfk7h-tny7p-vjkoe-i4krp-3qmcl-uqfgr-cpgej-yqtjq-rqe`.
  This exposes users to potential loss of funds on ledgers and unauthorized access
  to canisters they control.\n\n### Solution\nUsing version >1.0.1 of @dfinity/auth-client
  and @dfinity/identity packages, or @nfid/embed >0.10.1-alpha.6 includes patched
  versions of the issue.\n\nUser sessions will be automatically fixed when they re-authenticate.\n\n###
  Why this happened\nThe DFINITY auth client library provides a function, `Ed25519KeyIdentity.generate`,
  for generating an Ed25519 key pair. This function includes an optional parameter
  to supply a 32-byte seed value, which will be utilized as the secret key. In cases
  where no seed value is provided, the library is expected to generate the secret
  key using secure randomness. However, a recent update of DFINITY libraries has compromised
  this assurance by employing an insecure seed for key pair generation.\n\n### References\n[AgentJS
