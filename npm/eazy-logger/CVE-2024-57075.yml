title: "eazy-logger prototype pollution"
description: "A prototype pollution in the lib.Logger function of eazy-logger v4.0.1
  allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via supplying a crafted payload.\n\nAn
  attacker can supply a payload with `Object.prototype` setter to introduce or modify
  properties within the global prototype chain, causing denial of service (DoS) a
  the minimum consequence.\n\nMoreover, the consequences of this vulnerability can
  escalate to other injection-based attacks, depending on how the library integrates
  within the application. For instance, if the polluted property propagates to sensitive
  Node.js APIs (e.g., `child_process.exec`, `eval`), it could enable an attacker to
  execute arbitrary commands within the application's context."
