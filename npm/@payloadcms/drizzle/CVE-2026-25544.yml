title: "@payloadcms/drizzle has SQL Injection in JSON/RichText Queries on PostgreSQL/SQLite
  Adapters"
description: "When querying JSON or richText fields, user input was directly embedded
  into SQL without escaping, enabling blind SQL Injection attacks. An unauthenticated
  attacker could extract sensitive data (emails, password reset tokens) and achieve
  full account takeover without password cracking.\n\n**Users are affected if ALL
  of these are true:**\n\n1. Payload version < v3.73.0\n2. Using a Drizzle-based database
  adapter (`@payloadcms/drizzle` as dependency):\n- `@payloadcms/db-postgres`\n- `@payloadcms/db-vercel-postgres`\n-
  `@payloadcms/db-sqlite`\n- `@payloadcms/db-d1-sqlite`\n3. At least one accessible
  collection that has a `type: 'json'` or `type: 'richText'` field where `access.read`
  returns anything other than `false` (`true` or `Where` constraint)\n\n**Users are
  NOT affected if:**\n\n- Using `@payloadcms/db-mongodb`\n- No JSON or richText fields
  exist in any collection\n- All JSON/richText fields have `access: { read: () =>
  false }`"
