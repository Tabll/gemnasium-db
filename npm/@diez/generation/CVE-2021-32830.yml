identifier: "CVE-2021-32830"
package_slug: "npm/@diez/generation"
title: "Command Injection"
description: "The @diez/generation npm package is a client for Diez. The `locateFont`
  method of @diez/generation has a command injection vulnerability. Clients of the
  @diez/generation library are unlikely to be aware of this, so they might unwittingly
  write code that contains a vulnerability. This issue may lead to remote code execution
  if a client of the library calls the vulnerable method with untrusted input."
