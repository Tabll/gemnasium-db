package_slug: "npm/@mattkrick/sanitize-svg"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)"
description: "The `sanitize-svg` package, a small SVG sanitizer to prevent cross-site
  scripting attacks, uses a deny-list-pattern to sanitize SVGs to prevent XSS. In
  doing so, literal `<script>`-tags and on-event handlers were detected in versions
  prior to 0.4.0. As a result, downstream software that relies on `sanitize-svg` and
  expects resulting SVGs to be safe, may be vulnerable to cross-site scripting. This
  vulnerability was addressed in v0.4.0. There are no known workarounds"
