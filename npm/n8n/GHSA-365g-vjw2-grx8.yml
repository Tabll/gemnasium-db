title: "n8n: Execute Command Node Allows Authenticated Users to Run Arbitrary Commands
  on Host"
description: "The `Execute Command` node in n8n allows execution of arbitrary commands
  on the host system where n8n runs. While this functionality is intended for advanced
  automation and can be useful in certain workflows, it poses a security risk if all
  users with access to the n8n instance are not fully trusted.\n\nAn attacker—either
  a malicious user or someone who has compromised a legitimate user account—could
  exploit this node to run arbitrary commands on the host machine, potentially leading
  to data exfiltration, service disruption, or full system compromise.\n\nThis vulnerability
  affects all n8n deployments where:\n\n- The `Execute Command` node is enabled, and\n-
  Not all user accounts are strictly controlled and trusted.\n\nn8n.cloud is **not**
  impacted."
