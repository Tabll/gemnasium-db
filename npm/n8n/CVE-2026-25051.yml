title: "n8n's Improper CSP Enforcement in Webhook Responses May Allow Stored XSS"
description: "A Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in the
  handling of webhook responses and related HTTP endpoints. Under certain conditions,
  the Content Security Policy (CSP) sandbox protection intended to isolate HTML responses
  may not be applied correctly.\n\nAn authenticated user with permission to create
  or modify workflows could abuse this to execute malicious scripts with same-origin
  privileges when other users interact with the crafted workflow. This could lead
  to session hijacking and account takeover."
