title: "n8n's Missing Stripe-Signature Verification Allows Unauthenticated Forged
  Webhooks"
description: "An authentication bypass in the Stripe Trigger node allows unauthenticated
  parties to trigger workflows by sending forged Stripe webhook events.\n\nThe Stripe
  Trigger creates and stores a Stripe webhook signing secret when registering the
  webhook endpoint, but incoming webhook requests were not verified against this secret.
  As a result, any HTTP client that knows the webhook URL could send a POST request
  containing a matching event `type`, causing the workflow to execute as if a legitimate
  Stripe event had been received.\n\nThis issue affects n8n users who have active
  workflows using the Stripe Trigger node. An attacker could potentially fake payment
  or subscription events and influence downstream workflow behavior. The practical
  risk is reduced by the fact that the webhook URL contains a high-entropy UUID; however,
  authenticated n8n users with access to the workflow can view this webhook ID."
