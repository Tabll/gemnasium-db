title: "n8n: Webhook Node IP `Whitelist` Bypass via Partial String Matching"
description: "The Webhook node’s IP `whitelist` validation performed partial string
  matching instead of exact IP comparison. As a result, an incoming request could
  be accepted if the source IP address merely contained the configured `whitelist`
  entry as a substring.\n\nThis issue affected instances where workflow editors relied
  on IP-based access controls to restrict webhook access. Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
  were impacted. An attacker with a non-`whitelist`ed IP could bypass restrictions
  if their IP shared a partial prefix with a trusted address, undermining the intended
  security boundary."
