title: "n8n has a Python sandbox escape"
description: "A vulnerability in the Python Code node allows authenticated users to
  break out of the Python sandbox environment and execute code outside the intended
  security boundary.\n\nOnly authenticated users are able to execute code through
  Task Runners.\n\nThis issue affected any deployment in which the following conditions
  were met:\n\n- Task Runners were enabled using `N8N_RUNNERS_ENABLED=true` (default:
  false)\n- Python was enabled `N8N_PYTHON_ENABLED=true`\n- Code Node was enabled
  (default: true)\n\nIn case the `N8N_RUNNERS_MODE` is set to `external` (default:
  `internal`) the sandbox escape is limited to the sidecar container with lower risk
  for lateral movement. In that case a lower high severity is more appropriate."
