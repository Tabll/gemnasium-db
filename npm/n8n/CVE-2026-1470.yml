title: "n8n Unsafe Workflow Expression Evaluation Allows Remote Code Execution"
description: "n8n contains a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in
  its workflow Expression evaluation system. Expressions supplied by authenticated
  users during workflow configuration may be evaluated in an execution context that
  is not sufficiently isolated from the underlying runtime.\n\nAn authenticated attacker
  could abuse this behavior to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the n8n
  process. Successful exploitation may lead to full compromise of the affected instance,
  including unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of workflows, and
  execution of system-level operations."
