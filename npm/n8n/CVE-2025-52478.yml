title: "Stored XSS in n8n Form Trigger allows Account Takeover via injected iframe
  and video/source"
description: "A stored **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability was identified
  in [n8n](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n), specifically in the **Form Trigger** node's
  **HTML form element**. An authenticated attacker can inject malicious HTML via an
  `<iframe>` with a `srcdoc` payload that includes arbitrary JavaScript execution.
  The attacker can also inject malicious Javascript by using `<video>` coupled `<source>`
  using an `onerror` event.\n\nWhile using `iframe` or a combination of `video` and
  `source` tag, this vulnerability allows for Account Takeover (ATO) by exfiltrating
  `n8n-browserId` and session cookies from authenticated users who visit a maliciously
  crafted form. Using these tokens and cookies, an attacker can impersonate the victim
  and change account details such as email addresses, enabling full control over the
  accountâ€”especially if 2FA is not enabled."
