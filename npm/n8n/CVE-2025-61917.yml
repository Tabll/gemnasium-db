title: "n8n's Unsafe Buffer Allocation Allows In-Process Memory Disclosure in Task
  Runner"
description: "The use of `Buffer.allocUnsafe()` and `Buffer.allocUnsafeSlow()` in
  the task runner allowed untrusted code to allocate uninitialized memory. Such uninitialized
  buffers could contain residual data from within the same Node.js process (for example,
  data from prior requests, tasks, secrets, or tokens), resulting in potential information
  disclosure.\n\nOnly authenticated users are able to execute code through Task Runners.\n\nThis
  issue affected any deployment in which both of the following conditions were met:\n-
  Task Runners were enabled using `N8N_RUNNERS_ENABLED=true` (default: false)\n- Code
  Node was enabled (default: true)"
