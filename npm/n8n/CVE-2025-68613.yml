title: "n8n Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution via Expression Injection"
description: "n8n contains a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in
  its workflow expression evaluation system. Under certain conditions, expressions
  supplied by authenticated users during workflow configuration may be evaluated in
  an execution context that is not sufficiently isolated from the underlying runtime.\n\nAn
  authenticated attacker could abuse this behavior to execute arbitrary code with
  the privileges of the n8n process. Successful exploitation may lead to full compromise
  of the affected instance, including unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification
  of workflows, and execution of system-level operations."
