package_slug: "npm/n8n"
title: "n8n Vulnerable to Stored XSS through Attachments View Endpoint"
description: "n8n workflows can store and serve binary files, which are accessible
  to authenticated users. However, there was no restriction on the MIME type of uploaded
  files, and the MIME type could be controlled via a GET parameter. This allowed the
  server to respond with any MIME type, potentially enabling malicious content to
  be interpreted and executed by the browser.\n\nAn authenticated attacker with member-level
  permissions could exploit this by uploading a crafted HTML file containing malicious
  JavaScript. When another user visits the binary data endpoint with the MIME type
  set to text/html, the script executes in the context of the user’s session. This
  script could, for example, send a request to change the user’s email address in
  their account settings, effectively enabling account takeover."
