title: "n8n Vulnerable to Command Injection in Community Package Installation"
description: "A Command Injection vulnerability was identified in n8n’s community
  package installation functionality. The issue allowed authenticated users with administrative
  permissions to execute arbitrary system commands on the n8n host under specific
  conditions.\n\n**Important context**\n\n- Exploitation requires _administrative_
  access to the n8n instance.\n- The affected functionality is restricted to trusted
  users who are already permitted to install third-party community packages.\n- No
  unauthenticated or low-privilege exploitation is possible.\n- There is no evidence
  of exploitation in the wild.\n\nBecause administrative users can already extend
  n8n with custom or community code, the vulnerability does not meaningfully expand
  the threat model beyond existing administrator capabilities. However, it represents
  a violation of secure coding practices and has therefore been addressed."
