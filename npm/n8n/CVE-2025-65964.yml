title: "n8n vulnerable to Remote Code Execution via Git Node Custom Pre-Commit Hook"
description: "The n8n Git node allows workflows to set arbitrary Git configuration
  values through the _Add Config_ operation. When an attacker-controlled workflow
  sets `core.hooksPath` to a directory within the cloned repository containing a Git
  hook such as `pre-commit`, Git executes that hook during subsequent Git operations.
  Because Git hooks run as local system commands, this behavior can lead to **arbitrary
  command execution** on the underlying n8n host.\n\nSuccessful exploitation requires
  the ability to create or modify an n8n workflow that uses the Git node.\n\nAffected
