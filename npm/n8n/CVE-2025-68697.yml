package_slug: "npm/n8n"
title: "Self-hosted n8n has Legacy Code node that enables arbitrary file read/write"
description: "In self-hosted n8n instances where the Code node runs in legacy (non-task-runner)
  JavaScript execution mode, authenticated users with workflow editing access can
  invoke internal helper functions from within the Code node.\n\nThis allows a workflow
  editor to perform actions on the n8n host with the same privileges as the n8n process,
  including:\n\n- Reading files from the host filesystem (subject to any file-access
  restrictions configured on the instance and OS/container permissions)\n- Writing
  files to the host filesystem (subject to the same restrictions)\n\nStarting with
  n8n version 1.2.1, access to files in the n8n home directory (`.n8n`) is blocked
  by default. However, this does not restrict access to other parts of the filesystem
  unless additional file access limitations are configured."
