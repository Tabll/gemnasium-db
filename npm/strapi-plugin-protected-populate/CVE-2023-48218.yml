title: "Bypass of field access control in strapi-plugin-protected-populate"
description: "The Strapi Protected Populate Plugin protects `get` endpoints from revealing
  too much information. Prior to version 1.3.4, users were able to bypass the field
  level security. Users who tried to populate something that they didn't have access
  to could populate those fields anyway. This issue has been patched in version 1.3.4.
  There are no known workarounds."
