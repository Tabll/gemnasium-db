title: "Astro's bypass of image proxy domain validation leads to SSRF and potential
  XSS"
description: "This is a patch bypass of CVE-2025-58179 in commit [9ecf359](https://github.com/withastro/astro/commit/9ecf3598e2b29dd74614328fde3047ea90e67252).
  The fix blocks `http://`, `https://` and `//`, but can be bypassed using backslashes
  (`\\`) - the endpoint still issues a server-side fetch."
