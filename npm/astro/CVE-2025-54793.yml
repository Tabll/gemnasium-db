title: "Astros's duplicate trailing slash feature leads to an open redirection security
  issue"
description: "There is an Open Redirection vulnerability in the trailing slash redirection
  logic when handling paths with double slashes. This allows an attacker to redirect
  users to arbitrary external domains by crafting URLs such as `https://mydomain.com//malicious-site.com/`.
  This increases the risk of phishing and other social engineering attacks.\n\nThis
  affects Astro >=5.2.0 sites that use on-demand rendering (SSR) with the Node or
  Cloudflare adapter. It does not affect static sites, or sites deployed to Netlify
  or Vercel."
