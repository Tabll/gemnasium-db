title: "Astro's middleware authentication checks based on url.pathname can be bypassed
  via url encoded values"
description: "A mismatch exists between how Astro normalizes request paths for routing/rendering
  and how the application’s middleware reads the path for validation checks. Astro
  internally applies `decodeURI()` to determine which route to render, while the middleware
  uses `context.url.pathname` without applying the same normalization (decodeURI).\n\nThis
  discrepancy may allow attackers to reach protected routes (e.g., /admin) using encoded
  path variants that pass routing but bypass validation checks."
