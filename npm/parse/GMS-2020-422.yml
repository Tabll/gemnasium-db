title: "Storing Password in Local Storage"
description: "The `setPassword` method (http://parseplatform.org/Parse-SDK-JS/api/2.9.1/Parse.User.html#setPassword)
  stores the user's password in localStorage as raw text making it vulnerable to anyone
  with access to your localStorage. We believe this is the only time that password
  is stored at all. In the documentation under Users > Signing Up, it clearly states,
  \"We never store passwords in plaintext, nor will we ever transmit passwords back
  to the client in plaintext.\"\n\nExample Code:\n```js\nasync () => {\n const user
  = Parse.User.current()\n if (user) {\n user.setPassword('newpass')\n await user.save()\n
  }\n}\n```\nAfter running the above code, the new password will be stored in localStorage
  as a property named \"password\".\n\nProposed Solution:\nBefore saving anything
  to localStorage, Parse should strip out any properties named \"password\" that are
  attempting to be stored with a Parse.User type object.\n\nConfiguration:\nParse
