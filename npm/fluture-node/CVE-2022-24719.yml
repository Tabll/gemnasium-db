title: "Forwarding of confidentials headers to third parties in fluture-node"
description: "Using `followRedirects` or `followRedirectsWith` with any of the redirection
  strategies built into fluture-node 4.0.0 or 4.0.1, paired with a request that includes
  confidential headers such as Authorization or Cookie, exposes you to a vulnerability
  where, if the destination server were to redirect the request to a server on a third-party
  domain, or the same domain over unencrypted HTTP, the headers would be included
  in the follow-up request and be exposed to the third party, or potential http traffic
  sniffing."
