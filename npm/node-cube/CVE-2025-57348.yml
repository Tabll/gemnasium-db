  in its handling of prototype chain initialization, which could allow an attacker
  to inject properties into the prototype of built-in objects. This issue, categorized

  resource initialization process. Successful exploitation may lead to denial of service
  or arbitrary code execution in affected environments. The vulnerability affects
