title: "Element Plus Link component (el-link) implements insufficient input validation
  for the href attribute"
description: "Element Plus Link component (el-link) prior to 2.11.0 implements insufficient
  input validation for the href attribute, creating a security abstraction gap that
  obscures URL-based attack vectors. The component passes user-controlled href values
  directly to underlying anchor elements without protocol validation, URL sanitization,
  or security headers. This allows attackers to inject malicious URLs using dangerous
  protocols (javascript:, data:, file:) or redirect users to external malicious sites.
  While native HTML anchor elements present similar risks, UI component libraries
  bear additional responsibility for implementing security safeguards and providing
  clear risk documentation. The vulnerability enables XSS attacks, phishing campaigns,
  and open redirect exploits affecting applications that use Element Plus Link components
  with user-controlled or untrusted URL inputs.  As of version 2.11.0, Element Plus
  have clearly documented the risks inherent with the component."
