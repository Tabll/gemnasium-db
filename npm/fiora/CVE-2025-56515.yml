title: "Fiora chat group avatar is vulnerable to XSS via SVG files"
description: "File upload vulnerability in Fiora chat application 1.0.0 through user
  avatar upload functionality. The application fails to validate SVG file content,
  allowing malicious SVG files with embedded foreignObject elements containing iframe
  tags and JavaScript event handlers (onmouseover) to be uploaded and stored. When
  rendered, these SVG files execute arbitrary JavaScript, enabling attackers to steal
  user sessions, cookies, and perform unauthorized actions in the context of users
  viewing affected profiles."
