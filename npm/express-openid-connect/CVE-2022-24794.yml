package_slug: "npm/express-openid-connect"
title: "URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')"
description: "Express OpenID Connect is an Express JS middleware implementing sign
  on for Express web apps using OpenID Connect. Users of the `requiresAuth` middleware,
  either directly or through the default `authRequired` option, is vulnerable to an
  Open Redirect when the middleware is applied to a catch all route. If all routes
  under `example.com` are protected with the `requiresAuth` middleware, a visit to
  `http://example.com//google.com` will be redirected to `google.com` after login
  because the original url reported by the Express framework is not properly sanitized.
  This vulnerability affects versions prior to 2.7.2. Users are advised to upgrade.
  There are no known workarounds."
