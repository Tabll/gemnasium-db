title: "Malicious Package"
description: "All versions of `cage-js` contains malicious code. The malware downloads
  and runs a script from a remote server as a postinstall script. Any computer that
  has this package installed or running should be considered fully compromised. All
  secrets and keys stored on that computer should be rotated immediately from a different
  computer.\n\nThe package should be removed, but as full control of the computer
  may have been given to an outside entity, there is no guarantee that removing the
  package will remove all malicious software resulting from installing it."
