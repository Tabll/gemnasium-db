title: "Elysia affected by arbitrary code injection through cookie config"
description: "Arbitrary code execution from cookie config. If dynamic cookies are
  enabled (ie there exists a schema for cookies), the cookie config is injected into
  the compiled route without first being sanitised.\n\nAvailability of this exploit
  is generally low, as it requires write access to either the Elysia app's source
  code (in which case the vulnerability is meaningless) or write access to the cookie
  config (perhaps where it is assumed to be provisioned by the environment).\n\nHowever
  when combined with GHSA-hxj9-33pp-j2cc, this vulnerability allows for a full RCE
  chain."
