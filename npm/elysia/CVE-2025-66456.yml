title: "Elysia vulnerable to prototype pollution with multiple standalone schema validation"
description: "Prototype pollution vulnerability in `mergeDeep` after merging results
  of two standard schema validations with the same key. Due to the ordering of merging,
  there must be an `any` type that is set as a `standalone` guard, to allow for the
  `__proto__` prop to be merged.\n\nWhen combined with GHSA-8vch-m3f4-q8jf this allows
  for a full RCE by an attacker."
