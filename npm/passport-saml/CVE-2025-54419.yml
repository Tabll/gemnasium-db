title: "Node-SAML SAML Signature Verification Vulnerability"
description: "Node-SAML loads the assertion from the (unsigned) original response
  document. This is different than the parts that are verified when checking signature.\n\nThis
  allows an attacker to modify authentication details within a valid SAML assertion.
  For example, in one attack it is possible to remove any character from the SAML
  assertion username.\n\nTo conduct the attack an attacker would need a validly signed
  document from the identity provider (IdP).\n\nIn fixing this we made sure to process
  the SAML assertions from only verified/authenticated contents. This will prevent
  future variants from coming up.\n\nNote: this is distinct from the previous xml-crypto
  CVEs."
