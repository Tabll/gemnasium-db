title: "html inputs of type password recorded in plaintext when converted to text
  inputs"
description: "Highlight is an open source, full-stack monitoring platform. Highlight
  may record passwords on customer deployments when a password html input is switched
  to `type=\"text\"` via a javascript \"Show Password\" button. This differs from
  the expected behavior which always obfuscates `type=\"password\"` inputs. A customer
  may assume that switching to `type=\"text\"` would also not record this input; hence,
  they would not add additional `highlight-mask` css-class obfuscation to this part
  of the DOM, resulting in unintentional recording of a password value when a `Show
  Password` button is used. This issue was patched in version 6.0.0.\nThis patch tracks
  changes to the `type` attribute of an input to ensure an input that used to be a
  `type=\"password\"` continues to be obfuscated. \n"
