title: "AWS CDK CLI prints AWS credentials retrieved by custom credential plugins"
description: "The AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) [1] is an open-source software
  development framework for defining cloud infrastructure in code and provisioning
  it through AWS CloudFormation. The AWS CDK CLI [2] is a command line tool for interacting
  with CDK applications. Customers can use the CDK CLI to create, manage, and deploy
  their AWS CDK projects.\n\nAn issue exists in the AWS CDK CLI where, under certain
  conditions, AWS credentials may be returned in the console output. Plugins that
