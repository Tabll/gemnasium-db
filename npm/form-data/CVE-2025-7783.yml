- "GHSA-fjxv-7rqg-78g4"
package_slug: "npm/form-data"
title: "form-data uses unsafe random function in form-data for choosing boundary"
description: "form-data uses `Math.random()` to select a boundary value for multipart
  form-encoded data. This can lead to a security issue if an attacker:\n1. can observe
  other values produced by Math.random in the target application, and\n2. can control
  one field of a request made using form-data\n\nBecause the values of Math.random()
  are pseudo-random and predictable (see: https://blog.securityevaluators.com/hacking-the-javascript-lottery-80cc437e3b7f),
  an attacker who can observe a few sequential values can determine the state of the
  PRNG and predict future values, includes those used to generate form-data's boundary
  value. The allows the attacker to craft a value that contains a boundary value,
  allowing them to inject additional parameters into the request.\n\nThis is largely
  the same vulnerability as was [recently found in `undici`](https://hackerone.com/reports/2913312)
  by [`parrot409`](https://hackerone.com/parrot409?type=user) -- I'm not affiliated
  with that researcher but want to give credit where credit is due! My PoC is largely
  based on their work."
