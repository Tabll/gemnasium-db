identifier: "CVE-2018-0114"
package_slug: "npm/node-jose"
title: "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature"
description: "A vulnerability in the Cisco node-jose open source library could allow
  an unauthenticated, remote attacker to re-sign tokens using a key that is embedded
  within the token. The vulnerability is due to node-jose following the JSON Web Signature
  (JWS) standard for JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). This standard specifies that a JSON Web
  Key (JWK) representing a public key can be embedded within the header of a JWS.
  This public key is then trusted for verification. An attacker could exploit this
  by forging valid JWS objects by removing the original signature, adding a new public
  key to the header, and then signing the object using the (attacker-owned) private
  key associated with the public key embedded in that JWS header."
