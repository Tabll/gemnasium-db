title: "Improper calculations in ECC implementation can trigger a Denial-of-Service
  (DoS)"
description: "node-jose is a JavaScript implementation of the JSON Object Signing
  and Encryption (JOSE) for web browsers and node.js-based servers. Prior to version
  2.2.0, when using the non-default \"fallback\" crypto back-end, ECC operations in
  `node-jose` can trigger a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition, due to a possible infinite
  loop in an internal calculation. For some ECC operations, this condition is triggered
  randomly; for others, it can be triggered by malicious input. The issue has been
  patched in version 2.2.0. Since this issue is only present in the \"fallback\" crypto
  implementation, it can be avoided by ensuring that either WebCrypto or the Node
  `crypto` module is available in the JS environment where `node-jose` is being run."
