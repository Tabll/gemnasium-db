title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "NodeBB is Node.js based forum software. Starting in version 2.5.0 and
  prior to version 2.8.7, due to the use of the object destructuring assignment syntax
  in the user export code path, combined with a path traversal vulnerability, a specially
  crafted payload could invoke the user export logic to arbitrarily execute javascript
  files on the local disk. This issue is patched in version 2.8.7. As a workaround,
  site maintainers can cherry pick the fix into their codebase to patch the exploit."
