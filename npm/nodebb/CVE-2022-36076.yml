package_slug: "npm/nodebb"
title: "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
description: "NodeBB Forum Software is powered by Node.js and supports either Redis,
  MongoDB, or a PostgreSQL database. Due to an unnecessarily strict conditional in
  the code handling the first step of the SSO process, the pre-existing logic that
  added (and later checked) a nonce was inadvertently rendered opt-in instead of opt-out.
  This re-exposed a vulnerability in that a specially crafted Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)
  attack could theoretically take over another user account during the single sign-on
  process. The issue has been fully patched in version 1.17.2."
