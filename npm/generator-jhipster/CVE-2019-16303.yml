identifier: "CVE-2019-16303"
package_slug: "npm/generator-jhipster"
title: "Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)"
description: "A class generated by the Generator in JHipster produces code that uses
  an insecure source of randomness (`apache.commons.lang3 RandomStringUtils`). This
  allows an attacker (if able to obtain their own password reset URL) to compute the
  value for all other password resets for other accounts, thus allowing privilege
  escalation or account takeover."
