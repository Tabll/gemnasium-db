title: "generator-jhipster allows a timing attack against validateToken due to a string
  comparison that stops at the first character"
description: "JHipster generator-jhipster before 2.23.0 allows a timing attack against
  validateToken due to a string comparison that stops at the first character that
  is different. Attackers can guess tokens by brute forcing one character at a time
  and observing the timing. This of course drastically reduces the search space to
  a linear amount of guesses based on the token length times the possible characters."
