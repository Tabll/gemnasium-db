title: "High severity vulnerability that affects generator-jhipster"
description: "## Generated code uses repository configuration that downloads over
  HTTP instead of HTTPS\n\n### Impact\nGradle users were using the http://repo.spring.io/plugins-release
  repositories in plain HTTP, and not HTTPS, so a man-in-the-middle attack was possible
  at build time.\n\n### Patches\n\nMaven users should at least upgrade to 6.3.0 while
  Gradle users should update to 6.3.1.\nIf you are not able to upgrade make sure not
  to use a Maven repository via `http` in your build file.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nReplace
  all custom repository definitions in `build.gradle` or `pom.xml` with their `https`
  version.\n\ne.g.\n\n```xml\n <repository>\n            <id>oss.sonatype.org-snapshot</id>\n
  \           <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url> //
  <-- must be httpS\n            <releases>\n                <enabled>false</enabled>\n
  \           </releases>\n            <snapshots>\n                <enabled>true</enabled>\n
  \           </snapshots>\n</repository>\n```\n\n```gradle\nmaven { url \"https://repo.spring.io/plugins-release\"
  } // <-- must be httpS\n```\n\n### References\n* https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n*
