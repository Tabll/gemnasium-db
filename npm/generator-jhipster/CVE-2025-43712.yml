title: "Withdrawn Advisory: JHipster allows privilege escalation via a modified authorities
  parameter"
description: "## Withdrawn Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because the
  original report was found to be invalid. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references. For more information, see https://groups.google.com/g/jhipster-dev/c/ATSlWkEjw2w.\n\n##
  Original Description\n\nJHipster before v.8.9.0 allows privilege escalation via
  a modified authorities parameter. Upon registering in the JHipster portal and logging
  in as a standard user, the authorities parameter in the response from the api/account
  endpoint contains the value ROLE_USER. By manipulating the authorities parameter
  and changing its value to ROLE_ADMIN, the privilege is successfully escalated to
  an Admin level. This allowed the access to all admin-related functionalities in
  the application."
