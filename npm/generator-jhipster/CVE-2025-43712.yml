title: "JHipster allows privilege escalation via a modified authorities parameter"
description: "JHipster before v.8.9.0 allows privilege escalation via a modified authorities
  parameter. Upon registering in the JHipster portal and logging in as a standard
  user, the authorities parameter in the response from the api/account endpoint contains
  the value ROLE_USER. By manipulating the authorities parameter and changing its
  value to ROLE_ADMIN, the privilege is successfully escalated to an Admin level.
  This allowed the access to all admin-related functionalities in the application."
