title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "fhir-works-on-aws-authz-smart is an implementation of the authorization
  interface from the FHIR Works interface. Versions 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 are subject to
  Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor. This issue allows a
  client of the API to retrieve more information than the client’s OAuth scope permits
  when making “search-type” requests. This issue would not allow a client to retrieve
  information about individuals other than those the client was already authorized
  to access. Users of fhir-works-on-aws-authz-smart 3.1.1 or 3.1.2 should upgrade
  to version 3.1.3 or higher immediately. Versions 3.1.0 and below are unaffected.
  There is no workaround for this issue."
