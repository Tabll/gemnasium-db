title: "Directory Traversal in nodeload-nmickuli"
description: "Affected versions of `nodeload-nmickuli` resolve relative file paths,
  resulting in a directory traversal vulnerability. A malicious actor can use this
  vulnerability to access files outside of the intended directory root, which may
  result in the disclosure of private files on the vulnerable system.\n\nExample request:\n```\nGET
  /../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1\nhost:foo\n```\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo
  patch is available for this vulnerability.\n\nIt is recommended that the package
  is only used for local development, and if the functionality is needed for production,
  a different package is used instead."
