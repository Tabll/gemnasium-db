title: "Command Injection in treekill"
description: "All versions of `treekill` are vulnerable to Command Injection. The
  package fails to sanitize values passed to the  `kill` function. If this value is
  user-controlled it  may allow attackers to run arbitrary commands in the server.
  The issue only affects Windows systems.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently
  available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available."
