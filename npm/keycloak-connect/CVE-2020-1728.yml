identifier: "CVE-2020-1728"
package_slug: "npm/keycloak-connect"
title: "Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames"
description: "A vulnerability was found in all versions of Keycloak where the pages
  on the Admin Console area of the application are completely missing general HTTP
  security headers in HTTP-responses. This does not directly lead to a security issue,
  yet it might aid attackers in their efforts to exploit other problems. The flaws
  unnecessarily make the servers more prone to Clickjacking, channel downgrade attacks
  and other similar client-based attack vectors."
