identifier: "CVE-2019-3875"
package_slug: "npm/keycloak-connect"
title: "Improper Certificate Validation"
description: "The X.509 authenticator supports the verification of client certificates
  through the CRL, where the CRL list can be obtained from the URL provided in the
  certificate itself (CDP) or through the separately configured path. The CRL are
  often available over the network through unsecured protocols (`http` or `ldap`)
  and hence the caller should verify the signature and possibly the certification
  path. Keycloak currently does not validate signatures on CRL, which can result in
  a possibility of various attacks like man-in-the-middle."
