title: "Regular Expression Denial of Service in Acorn"
description: "Affected versions of acorn is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial
  of Service.\nA regex in the form of /[x-\\ud800]/u causes the parser to enter an
  infinite loop.\nThe string is not valid UTF16 which usually results in it being
  sanitized before reaching the parser.\nIf an application processes untrusted input
  and passes it directly to acorn,\nattackers may leverage the vulnerability leading
  to Denial of Service."
