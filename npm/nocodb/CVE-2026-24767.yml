title: "NocoDB has Blind SSRF via Unvalidated HEAD Request in uploadViaURL Functionality"
description: "A **blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** vulnerability exists
  in the `uploadViaURL` functionality due to an unprotected `HEAD` request. While
  the subsequent file retrieval logic correctly enforces SSRF protections, the initial
  metadata request executes without validation.\n\nThis allows limited outbound requests
  to arbitrary URLs before SSRF controls are applied.\n\n---"
