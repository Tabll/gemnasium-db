title: "NocoDB Vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG upload"
description: "A **stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability exists in NocoDB’s
  attachment handling mechanism. Authenticated users can upload malicious SVG files
  containing embedded JavaScript, which are later rendered inline and executed in
  the browsers of other users who view the attachment.\n\nBecause the malicious payload
  is stored server-side and executed under the application’s origin, successful exploitation
  can lead to account compromise, data exfiltration and unauthorized actions performed
  on behalf of affected users.\n\n---"
