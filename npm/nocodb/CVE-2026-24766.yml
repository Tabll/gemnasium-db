title: "NocoDB has Prototype Pollution in Connection Test Endpoint, Leading to DoS"
description: "An authenticated user with org-level-creator permissions can exploit
  prototype pollution in the `/api/v2/meta/connection/test` endpoint, causing all
  database write operations to fail application-wide until server restart.\n\nWhile
  the pollution technically bypasses SUPER_ADMIN authorization checks, no practical
  privileged actions can be performed because database operations fail immediately
  after pollution."
