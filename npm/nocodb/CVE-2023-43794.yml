title: "nocodb SQL Injection vulnerability"
description: "Nocodb is an open source Airtable alternative. Affected versions of
  nocodb contain a SQL injection vulnerability, that allows an authenticated attacker
  with creator access to query the underlying database. By supplying a specially crafted
  payload to the given an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries to be executed.
  Since this is a blind SQL injection, an attacker may need to use time-based payloads
  which would include a function to delay execution for a given number of seconds.
  The response time indicates, whether the result of the query execution was true
  or false. Depending on the result, the HTTP response will be returned after a given
  number of seconds, indicating TRUE, or immediately, indicating FALSE. In that way,
  an attacker can reveal the data present in the database. This vulnerability has
  been addressed in version 0.111.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
  workarounds for this vulnerability. This issue is also tracked as `GHSL-2023-141`."
