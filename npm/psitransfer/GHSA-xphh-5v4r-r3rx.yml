title: "PsiTransfer has Zip Slip Path Traversal via TAR Archive Download"
description: "A Zip Slip vulnerability in PsiTransfer allows an unauthenticated attacker
  to upload files with path traversal sequences in the filename (e.g. `../../../.ssh/authorized_keys`).
  When a victim downloads the bucket as a **.tar.gz** archive and extracts it, malicious
  files are written outside the intended directory, potentially leading to RCE."
