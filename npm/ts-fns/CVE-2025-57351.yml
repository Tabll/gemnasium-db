title: "ts-fns has prototype pollution vulnerability"
description: "A prototype pollution vulnerability exists in the ts-fns package versions
  prior to 13.0.7, where insufficient validation of user-provided keys in the assign
  function allows attackers to manipulate the Object.prototype chain. By leveraging
  this flaw, adversaries may inject arbitrary properties into the global object's
  prototype, potentially leading to application crashes, unexpected code execution
  behaviors, or bypasses of security-critical validation logic dependent on prototype
  integrity. The vulnerability stems from improper handling of deep property assignment
  operations within the library's public API functions. This issue remains unaddressed
  in the latest available version."
