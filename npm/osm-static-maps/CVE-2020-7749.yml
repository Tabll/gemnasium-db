identifier: "CVE-2020-7749"
package_slug: "npm/osm-static-maps"
title: "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
description: "A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) issue exists in the osm-static-maps
  package. User input given to the package is passed directly to a template without
  escaping `({{{ ... }}})`. As such, it is possible for an attacker to inject arbitrary
  `HTML/JS` code depending on the context. The contents will be output as HTML on
  the page which gives opportunity for XSS, or possibly, rendered on the server (puppeteer)
  which may allow for SSRF and Local File Read vulnerabilities to be exploited."
