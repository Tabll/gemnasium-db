title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "In versions `<=8.5.1` of `jsonwebtoken` library, lack of algorithm definition
  in the `jwt.verify()` function can lead to signature validation bypass due to defaulting
  to the `none` algorithm for signature verification. Users are affected if you do
  not specify algorithms in the `jwt.verify()` function. This issue has been fixed,
  please update to version 9.0.0 which removes the default support for the none algorithm
  in the `jwt.verify()` method. There will be no impact, if you update to version
  9.0.0 and you donâ€™t need to allow for the `none` algorithm. If you need 'none' algorithm,
  you have to explicitly specify that in `jwt.verify()` options."
