title: "Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')"
description: "Modelina is a library for generating data models based on inputs such
  as AsyncAPI, OpenAPI, or JSON Schema documents. Versions prior to 1.0.0 is vulnerable
  to Code injection. This issue affects anyone who is using the default presets and/or
  does not handle the functionality themself. This issue has been partially mitigated
  in version 1.0.0, with the maintainer's GitHub Security Advisory (GHSA) noting \"It
  is impossible to fully guard against this, because users have access to the original
  raw information. However, as of version 1, if you only access the constrained models,
  you will not encounter this issue. Further similar situations are NOT seen as a
  security issue, but intended behavior.\" The suggested workaround from the maintainers
  is \"Fully custom presets that change the entire rendering process which can then
  escape the user input.\""
