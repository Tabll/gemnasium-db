package_slug: "npm/signalk-server"
title: "Signal K Server Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution via Malicious npm Package"
description: "The SignalK appstore interface allows administrators to install npm
  packages through a REST API endpoint. While the endpoint validates that the package
  name exists in the npm registry as a known plugin or webapp, the version parameter
  accepts arbitrary npm version specifiers including URLs. npm supports installing
  packages from git repositories, GitHub shorthand syntax, and HTTP/HTTPS URLs pointing
  to tarballs. When npm installs a package, it can automatically execute any `postinstall`
  script defined in `package.json`, enabling arbitrary code execution.\n\nThe vulnerability
  exists because npm's version specifier syntax is extremely flexible, and the SignalK
  code passes the version parameter directly to npm without sanitization. An attacker
  with admin access can install a package from an attacker-controlled source containing
  a malicious `postinstall` script."
