title: "Signal K Server vulnerable to JWT Token Theft via WebSocket Enumeration and
  Unauthenticated Polling"
description: "SignalK Server exposes two features that can be chained together to
  steal JWT authentication tokens without any prior authentication. The attack combines
  WebSocket-based request enumeration with unauthenticated polling of access request
  status.\n\n**Unauthenticated WebSocket Request Enumeration**: When a WebSocket client
  connects to the SignalK stream endpoint with the `serverevents=all` query parameter,
  the server sends all cached server events including `ACCESS_REQUEST` events that
  contain details about pending access requests. The `startServerEvents` function
  iterates over `app.lastServerEvents` and writes each cached event to any connected
  client without verifying authorization level. Since WebSocket connections are allowed
  for readonly users (which includes unauthenticated users when `allow_readonly` is
  true), attackers receive these events containing request IDs, client identifiers,
  descriptions, requested permissions, and IP addresses.\n\n**Unauthenticated Token
  Polling**: The access request status endpoint at `/signalk/v1/access/requests/:id`
  returns the full state of an access request without requiring authentication. When
  an administrator approves a request, the response includes the issued JWT token
  in plaintext. The `queryRequest` function returns the complete request object including
  the token field, and the REST endpoint uses readonly authentication, allowing unauthenticated
  access.\n\nAn attacker has two paths to exploit these vulnerabilities:\n\n1. The
  attacker creates their own access request (using the IP spoofing vulnerability to
  craft a convincing spoofed request), then polls their own request ID until an administrator
  approves it, receiving the JWT token.\n\n2. The attacker passively monitors the
  WebSocket stream to discover request IDs from legitimate devices, then polls those
  IDs and steals the JWT tokens when administrators approve them, hijacking legitimate
  device credentials.\n\nBoth paths require zero authentication and enable complete
  authentication bypass."
