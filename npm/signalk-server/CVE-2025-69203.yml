title: "Signal K Server Vulnerable to Access Request Spoofing"
description: "The SignalK access request system has two related features that when
  combined by themselves and with the infromation disclosure vulnerability enable
  convincing social engineering attacks against administrators.\n\nWhen a device creates
  an access request, it specifies three fields: `clientId`, `description`, and `permissions`.
  The SignalK admin UI displays the `description` field prominently to the administrator
  when showing pending requests, but the actual `permissions` field (which determines
  the access level granted) is less visible or displayed separately. This allows an
  attacker to request `admin` permissions while providing a description that suggests
  readonly access.\n\nThe access request handler trusts the `X-Forwarded-For` HTTP
  header without validation to determine the client's IP address. This header is intended
  to preserve the original client IP when requests pass through reverse proxies, but
  when trusted unconditionally, it allows attackers to spoof their IP address. The
  spoofed IP is displayed to administrators in the access request approval interface,
  potentially making malicious requests appear to originate from trusted internal
  network addresses.\n\nSince device/source names can be enumerated via the information
  disclosure vulnerability, an attacker can impersonate a legitimate device or source,
  craft a convincing description, spoof a trusted internal IP address, and request
  elevated permissions, creating a highly convincing social engineering scenario that
  increases the likelihood of administrator approval."
