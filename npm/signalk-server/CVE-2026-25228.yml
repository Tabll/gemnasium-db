package_slug: "npm/signalk-server"
title: "SignalK Server has Path Traversal leading to information disclosure"
description: "A Path Traversal vulnerability in SignalK Server's `applicationData`
  API allows authenticated users on Windows systems to read, write, and list arbitrary
  files and directories on the filesystem. The `validateAppId()` function blocks forward
  slashes (`/`) but not backslashes (`\\`), which are treated as directory separators
  by `path.join()` on Windows. This enables attackers to escape the intended `applicationData`
  directory."
