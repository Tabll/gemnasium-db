title: "Signal K Server has Unauthenticated State Pollution leading to Remote Code
  Execution (RCE)"
description: "An unauthenticated attacker can pollute the internal state (`restoreFilePath`)
  of the server via the `/skServer/validateBackup` endpoint. This allows the attacker
  to hijack the administrator's \"Restore\" functionality to overwrite critical server
  configuration files (e.g., `security.json`, `package.json`), leading to account
  takeover and Remote Code Execution (RCE)."
