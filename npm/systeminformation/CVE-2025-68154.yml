title: "systeminformation has a Command Injection vulnerability in fsSize() function
  on Windows"
description: "The `fsSize()` function in `systeminformation` is vulnerable to **OS
  Command Injection (CWE-78)** on Windows systems. The optional `drive` parameter
  is directly concatenated into a PowerShell command without sanitization, allowing
  arbitrary command execution when user-controlled input reaches this function.\n\n**Affected
  Platforms:** Windows only\n\n**CVSS Breakdown:**\n- **Attack Vector (AV:N):** Network
  - if used in a web application/API\n- **Attack Complexity (AC:H):** High - requires
  application to pass user input to `fsSize()`\n- **Privileges Required (PR:N):**
  None - no authentication required at library level\n- **User Interaction (UI:N):**
  None\n- **Scope (S:U):** Unchanged - executes within Node.js process context\n-
  **Confidentiality/Integrity/Availability (C:H/I:H/A:H):** High impact if exploited\n\n>
  **Note:** The actual exploitability depends on how applications use this function.
  If an application does not pass user-controlled input to `fsSize()`, it is not vulnerable.\n\n---"
