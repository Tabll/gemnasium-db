title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "iziModal is a modal plugin with jQuery. Versions prior to 1.6.1 is vulnerable
  to cross-site scripting (XSS) when handling untrusted modal titles. An attacker
  who is able to influence the field `title` when creating a `iziModal` instance is
  able to supply arbitrary `html` or `javascript` code that will be rendered in the
  context of a user, potentially leading to `XSS`. Version 1.6.1 contains a patch
  for this issue"
