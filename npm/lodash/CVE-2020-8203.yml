title: "Prototype Pollution in lodash"
description: "Versions of lodash prior to 4.17.19 are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution.
  The functions `pick`, `set`, `setWith`, `update`, `updateWith`, and `zipObjectDeep`
  allow a malicious user to modify the prototype of Object if the property identifiers
  are user-supplied. Being affected by this issue requires manipulating objects based
  on user-provided property values or arrays.\n\nThis vulnerability causes the addition
  or modification of an existing property that will exist on all objects and may lead
  to Denial of Service or Code Execution under specific circumstances."
