title: "Lodash has Prototype Pollution Vulnerability in `_.unset` and `_.omit` functions"
description: "Lodash versions 4.0.0 through 4.17.22 are vulnerable to prototype pollution
  in the `_.unset` and `_.omit` functions. An attacker can pass crafted paths which

  of properties but does not allow overwriting their original behavior."
