package_slug: "npm/jquery-ui"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "jQuery-UI is the official jQuery user interface library. Prior to version
  1.13.0, accepting the value of the `of` option of the `.position()` util from untrusted
  sources may execute untrusted code. The issue is fixed in jQuery UI 1.13.0. Any
  string value passed to the `of` option is now treated as a CSS selector. A workaround
  is to not accept the value of the `of` option from untrusted sources."
