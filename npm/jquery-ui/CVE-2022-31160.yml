package_slug: "npm/jquery-ui"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "jQuery UI is a curated set of user interface interactions, effects,
  widgets, and themes built on top of jQuery. Versions prior to 1.13.2 are potentially
  vulnerable to cross-site scripting. Initializing a checkboxradio widget on an input
  enclosed within a label makes that parent label contents considered as the input
  label. Calling `.checkboxradio( \"refresh\" )` on such a widget and the initial
  HTML contained encoded HTML entities will make them erroneously get decoded. This
  can lead to potentially executing JavaScript code. The bug has been patched in jQuery
  UI 1.13.2. To remediate the issue, someone who can change the initial HTML can wrap
  all the non-input contents of the `label` in a `span`."
