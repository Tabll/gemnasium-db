package_slug: "npm/jquery-ui"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "jQuery-UI is the official jQuery user interface library. Prior to version
  1.13.0, accepting the value of the `altField` option of the Datepicker widget from
  untrusted sources may execute untrusted code. The issue is fixed in jQuery UI 1.13.0.
  Any string value passed to the `altField` option is now treated as a CSS selector.
  A workaround is to not accept the value of the `altField` option from untrusted
  sources."
