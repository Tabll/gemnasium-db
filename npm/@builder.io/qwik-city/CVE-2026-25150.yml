package_slug: "npm/@builder.io/qwik-city"
title: "Prototype Pollution via FormData Processing in Qwik City"
description: "A Prototype Pollution vulnerability exists in the `formToObj()` function
  within `@builder.io/qwik-city` middleware. The function processes form field names
  with dot notation (e.g., `user.name`) to create nested objects, but fails to sanitize
  dangerous property names like `__proto__`, `constructor`, and `prototype`. This
  allows unauthenticated attackers to pollute `Object.prototype` by sending crafted
  HTTP POST requests, potentially leading to privilege escalation, authentication
  bypass, or denial of service."
