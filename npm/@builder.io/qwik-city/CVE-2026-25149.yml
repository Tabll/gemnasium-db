title: "Qwik City Open Redirect via fixTrailingSlash"
description: "**Description**\nAn Open Redirect (CWE-601) vulnerability in Qwik City's
  default request handler middleware allows a remote attacker to redirect users to
  arbitrary protocol-relative URLs. Successful exploitation permits attackers to craft
  convincing phishing links that appear to originate from the trusted domain but redirect
  the victim to an attacker-controlled site. This affects qwik-city before version
  1.19.0. This has been patched in qwik-city version 1.19.0."
