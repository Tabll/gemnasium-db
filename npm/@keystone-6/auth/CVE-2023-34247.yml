package_slug: "npm/@keystone-6/auth"
title: "URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')"
description: "Keystone is a content management system for Node.JS. There is an open
  redirect in the `@keystone-6/auth` package versions 7.0.0 and prior, where the redirect
  leading `/` filter can be bypassed. Users may be redirected to domains other than
  the relative host, thereby it might be used by attackers to re-direct users to an
  unexpected location. To mitigate this issue, one may apply a patch from pull request
  8626 or avoid using the `@keystone-6/auth` package."
