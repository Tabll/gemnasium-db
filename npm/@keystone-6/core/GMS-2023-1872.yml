title: "@keystone-6/core's bundled cuid package known to be insecure"
description: "### Summary\nThe `cuid` package used by `@keystone-6/*` and upstream
  dependencies is deprecated and [marked as insecure by the 
  author](https://github.com/paralleldrive/cuid#status-deprecated-due-to-security-use-cuid2-instead).
  \n\nAs
  reported by the author\n> Cuid and other k-sortable and non-cryptographic ids (Ulid,
  ObjectId, KSUID, all UUIDs) are all insecure. Use @paralleldrive/cuid2 instead.\n\n###
  What are doing about this?\n- [We are waiting on 
  Prisma](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/issues/8282)
  to add support for [`cuid2`](https://github.com/paralleldrive/cuid2)\n- Alternatively,
  we might default to a random string ourselves\n\n### What can I do about this?\nWe
  have added a work-around for users who want to provide custom identifiers in 
  https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/pull/8645\n\n###
  What if I need a `cuid`?\nThe features marked as a security vulnerability by @paralleldrive
  are sometimes actually needed ([as written in the README of 
  `cuid`](https://github.com/paralleldrive/cuid#motivation))
  - the problem is the inherent risks that features like this can have.\n\nYou might
  actually want the features of a monotonically increasing (auto-increment, k-sortable),
  and timestamp-based id as part of your application, and keystone should support
  that - but you might not want them by _default_.\nThis is why this security advisory
  has been accepted by me (@dcousens), we currently use cuid identifiers by default,
  and that should change.\n\n### Impact\nI have accepted this security advisory on
  the basis that we don't need this kind of identifier typically, and the need for
  them should be driven by an application's requirements, not a convenient default.\n"
