identifier: "CVE-2020-26237"
package_slug: "npm/highlight.js"
title: "Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)"
description: "`highlight.js` is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. A malicious HTML
  code block can be crafted that will result in prototype pollution of the base object's
  prototype during highlighting. If you allow users to insert custom HTML code blocks
  into your `page/app` via parsing Markdown code blocks (or similar) and do not filter
  the language names the user can provide you may be vulnerable. The pollution should
  just be harmless data but this can cause problems for applications not expecting
  these properties to exist and can result in strange behavior or application crashes,
  i.e., a potential DoS vector. If your website or application does not render user
  provided data it should be unaffected. and newer include fixes for this vulnerability."
