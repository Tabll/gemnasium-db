title: "Vuetify has a Prototype Pollution vulnerability"
description: "The Preset configuration feature of Vuetify is vulnerable to Prototype
  Pollution due to the internal 'mergeDeep' utility function used to merge options
  with defaults. Using a specially-crafted, malicious preset can result in polluting
  all JavaScript objects with arbitrary properties, which can further negatively affect
  all aspects of the application's behavior. This can lead to a wide range of security
  issues, including resource exhaustion/denial of service or unauthorized access to
  data.\n\nIf the application utilizes Server-Side Rendering (SSR), this vulnerability
  could affect the whole server process.\n\nThis issue affects Vuetify versions greater
  than or equal to 2.2.0-beta.2 and less than 3.0.0-alpha.10.\n\nNote:\nVersion 2.x
  of Vuetify is End-of-Life and will not receive any updates to address this issue.
