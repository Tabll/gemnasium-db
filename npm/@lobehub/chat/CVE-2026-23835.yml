- "GHSA-wrrr-8jcv-wjf5"
package_slug: "npm/@lobehub/chat"
title: "LobeHub Vulnerable to Improper Authorization in Presigned Upload"
description: "The file upload feature in `Knowledge Base > File Upload` does not validate
  the integrity of the upload request, allowing users to intercept and modify the
  request parameters. As a result, it is possible to create arbitrary files in abnormal
  or unintended paths. In addition, since `lobechat.com` relies on the size parameter
  from the request to calculate file usage, an attacker can manipulate this value
  to misrepresent the actual file size, such as uploading a `1 GB` file while reporting
  it as `10 MB`, or falsely declaring a `10 MB` file as a `1 GB` file."
