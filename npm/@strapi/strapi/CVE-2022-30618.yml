- "CVE-2022-30618"
package_slug: "npm/@strapi/strapi"
title: "Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer"
description: "An authenticated user with access to the Strapi admin panel can view
  private and sensitive data, such as email and password reset tokens, for API users
  if content types accessible to the authenticated user contain relationships to API
  users (from:users-permissions). There are many scenarios in which such details from
  API users can leak in the JSON response within the admin panel, either through a
  direct or indirect relationship. Access to this information enables a user to compromise
  these usersâ€™ accounts if the password reset API endpoints have been enabled. In
  a worst-case scenario, a low-privileged user could get access to a high-privileged
  API account, and could read and modify any data as well as block access to both
  the admin panel and API by revoking privileges for all other users."
