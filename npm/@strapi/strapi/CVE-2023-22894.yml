title: "Strapi leaking sensitive user information by filtering on private fields"
description: "Strapi through 4.5.5 allows attackers (with access to the admin panel)
  to discover sensitive user details by exploiting the query filter. The attacker
  can filter users by columns that contain sensitive information and infer a value
  from API responses. If the attacker has super admin access, then this can be exploited
  to discover the password hash and password reset token of all users. If the attacker
  has admin panel access to an account with permission to access the username and
  email of API users with a lower privileged role (e.g., Editor or Author), then this
  can be exploited to discover sensitive information for all API users but not other
  admin accounts."
