package_slug: "npm/@strapi/strapi"
title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "Strapi is an open-source headless content management system. Prior to
  version 4.10.8, anyone (Strapi developers, users, plugins) can make every attribute
  of a Content-Type public without knowing it. The vulnerability only affects the
  handling of content types by Strapi, not the actual content types themselves. Users
  can use plugins or modify their own content types without realizing that the `privateAttributes`
  getter is being removed, which can result in any attribute becoming public. This
  can lead to sensitive information being exposed or the entire system being taken
  control of by an attacker(having access to password hashes). Anyone can be impacted,
  depending on how people are using/extending content-types. If the users are mutating
  the content-type, they will not be affected. Version 4.10.8 contains a patch for
  this issue."
