package_slug: "npm/directus"
title: "Directus Vulnerable to Information Leakage in Existing Collections"
description: "An observable difference in error messaging was found in the Directus
  REST API. The `/items/{collection}` API returns different error messages for these
  two cases:\n1. A user tries to access an existing collection which they are not
  authorized to access.\n2. A user tries to access a non-existing collection.\n\nThe
  two differing error messages leak the existence of collections to users which are
  not authorized to access these collections."
