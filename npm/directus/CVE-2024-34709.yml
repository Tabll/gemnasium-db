title: "Directus Lacks Session Tokens Invalidation"
description: "Currently session tokens function like the other JWT tokens where they
  are not actually invalidated when logging out. The `directus_session` gets destroyed
  and the cookie gets deleted but if you captured the cookie value it will still work
  for the entire expiry time which is set to 1 day by default. Making it effectively
  a long lived unrevokable stateless token instead of the stateful session token it
  was meant to be.\nWhen authenticating a session token JWT, Directus should also
  check whether the associated `directus_session` both still exists and has not expired
  (although the token should expire at the same time or before the session) to ensure
  leaked tokens are not valid indefinitely."
