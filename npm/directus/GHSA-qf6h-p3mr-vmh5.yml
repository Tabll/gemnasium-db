description: "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-9qrm-48qf-r2rw. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n## Original Description\nDirectus v10.13.0 allows an authenticated
  external attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript on the client. This is possible
  because the application injects an attacker-controlled parameter that will be stored
  in the server and used by the client into an unsanitized DOM element. When chained
  with CVE-2024-6534, it could result in account takeover."
