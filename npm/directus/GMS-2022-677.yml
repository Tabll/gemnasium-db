package_slug: "npm/directus"
title: "Insecure default value for CORS configuration"
description: "### Impact\n\nThe default value for the `CORS_ENABLED` and `CORS_ORIGIN`
  configuration was set to be very permissive by default. This could lead to unauthorized
  access in uncontrolled environments when the configuration hasn't been changed.\n\n###
  Patches\n\nThe default values for CORS have been changed in https://github.com/directus/directus/pull/12022
  which is released under 9.7.0\n\n### Workarounds\n\nConfigure the CORS environment
  variables to match your project's usage, rather than leaving them at the (permissive)
  defaults.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about
  this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [directus/directus](https://github.com/directus/directus)\n*
