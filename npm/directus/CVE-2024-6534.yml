title: "Improper access control in Directus"
description: "Directus v10.13.0 allows an authenticated external attacker to modify
  presets created by the same user to assign them to another user. This is possible
  because the application only validates the user parameter in the 'POST /presets'Â request
  but not in the PATCH request. When chained with CVE-2024-6533, it could result in
  account takeover."
