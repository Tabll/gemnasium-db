description: "Directus is a free and open-source data platform for headless content
  management. The Directus process can be aborted by having an authorized user update
  the `filename_disk` value to a folder and accessing that file through the `/assets`
  endpoint. This vulnerability has been patched and release v9.15.0 contains the fix.
  Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may prevent this problem by
  making sure no (untrusted) non-admin users have permissions to update the `filename_disk`
  field on `directus_files`."
