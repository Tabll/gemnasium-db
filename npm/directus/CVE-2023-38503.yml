package_slug: "npm/directus"
title: "Incorrect Authorization"
description: "Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database
  content. Starting in version 10.3.0 and prior to version 10.5.0, the permission
  filters (i.e. `user_created IS $CURRENT_USER`) are not properly checked when using
  GraphQL subscription resulting in unauthorized users getting event on their subscription
  which they should not be receiving according to the permissions. This can be any
  collection but out-of-the box the `directus_users` collection is configured with
  such a permissions filter allowing you to get updates for other users when changes
  happen. Version 10.5.0 contains a patch. As a workaround, disable GraphQL subscriptions."
