description: "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-3fff-gqw3-vj86. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n## Original Description\nDirectus v10.13.0 allows an authenticated
  external attacker to modify presets created by the same user to assign them to another
  user. This is possible because the application only validates the user parameter
  in the 'POST /presets'Â request but not in the PATCH request. When chained with CVE-2024-6533,
  it could result in account takeover."
