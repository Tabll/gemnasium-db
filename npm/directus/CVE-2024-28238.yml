package_slug: "npm/directus"
title: "Session Token in URL in directus"
description: "### Impact\n\nWhen reaching the /files page, a JWT is passed via GET
  request. Inclusion of session tokens in URLs poses a security risk as URLs are often
  logged in various places (e.g., web server logs, browser history). Attackers gaining
  access to these logs may hijack active user sessions, leading to unauthorized access
  to sensitive information or actions on behalf of the user.\n\n### Patches\n\n_Has
  the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere's
  no workaround available.\n\n### References\n\n_Are there any links users can visit
  to find out more?_\n"
