title: "Session is cached for OpenID and OAuth2 if `redirect` is not used"
description: "Unauthenticated user can access credentials of last authenticated user
  via OpenID or OAuth2 where the authentication URL did not include `redirect` query
  string.\n\nFor example:\n- Project is configured with OpenID or OAuth2\n- Project
  is configured with cache enabled\n- User tries to login via SSO link, but without
  `redirect` query string\n- After successful login, credentials are cached\n- If
  an unauthenticated user tries to login via SSO link, it will return the credentials
  of the other last user\n\nThe SSO link is something like `https://directus.example.com/auth/login/openid/callback`,
  where `openid` is the name of the OpenID provider configured in Directus"
