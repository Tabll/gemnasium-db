title: "Directus affected by VM2 sandbox escape vulnerability"
description: "### Impact\nIn vm2 for versions up to 3.9.19, Promise handler sanitization
  can be bypassed, allowing attackers to escape the sandbox and run arbitrary code.
  Within Directus this applies to the \"Run Script\" operation in flows being able
  to escape the sandbox running code in the main nodejs context.\n\n### Patches\nPatched
  in v10.6.0 by replacing `vm2` with `isolated-vm`\n\n### Workarounds\nNone\n\n###
