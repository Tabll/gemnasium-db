package_slug: "npm/directus"
title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database
  content. In versions prior to 9.16.0 users with read access to the `password` field
  in `directus_users` can extract the argon2 password hashes by brute forcing the
  export functionality combined with a `_starts_with` filter. This allows the user
  to enumerate the password hashes. Accounts cannot be taken over unless the hashes
  can be reversed which is unlikely with current hardware. This problem has been patched
  by preventing any hashed/concealed field to be filtered against with the `_starts_with`
  or other string operator in version 9.16.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users
  unable to upgrade may mitigate this issue by ensuring that no user has `read` access
  to the `password` field in `directus_users`."
