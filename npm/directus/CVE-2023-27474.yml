title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database
  content. Instances relying on an allow-listed reset URL is vulnerable to an HTML
  injection attack through the use of query parameters in the reset URL. An attacker
  could exploit this to email users urls to the servers domain but which may contain
  malicious code. The problem has been resolved and released under version 9.23.0.
  People relying on a custom password reset URL should upgrade to 9.23.0 or later,
  or remove the custom reset url from the configured allow list. Users are advised
  to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may disable the custom reset URL allow list
  as a workaround."
