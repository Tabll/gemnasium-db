title: "Directus has a DOM-Based cross-site scripting (XSS) via layout_options"
description: "Directus allows an authenticated attacker to save cross site scripting
  code to the database. This is possible because the application injects an attacker-controlled
  parameter that will be stored in the server and used by the client into an unsanitized
  DOM element. When chained with [CVE-2024-6534](https://github.com/directus/directus/security/advisories/GHSA-3fff-gqw3-vj86),
  it could result in account takeover."
