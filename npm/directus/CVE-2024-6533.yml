description: "Directus v10.13.0 allows an authenticated external attacker to execute
  arbitrary JavaScript on the client. This is possible because the application injects
  an attacker-controlled parameter that will be stored in the server and used by the
  client into an unsanitized DOM element. When chained with CVE-2024-6534, it could
  result in account takeover."
