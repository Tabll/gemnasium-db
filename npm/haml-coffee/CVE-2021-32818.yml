identifier: "CVE-2021-32818"
package_slug: "npm/haml-coffee"
title: "Cross-site Scripting"
description: "haml-coffee is a JavaScript templating solution. haml-coffee mixes pure
  template data with engine configuration options through the Express render API.
  More specifically, haml-coffee supports overriding a series of HTML helper functions
  through its configuration options. A vulnerable application that passes user controlled
  request objects to the haml-coffee template engine may introduce RCE vulnerabilities.
  Additionally control over the escapeHtml parameter through template configuration
  pollution ensures that haml-coffee would not sanitize template inputs that may result
  in reflected Cross Site Scripting attacks against downstream applications."
