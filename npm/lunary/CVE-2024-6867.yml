package_slug: "npm/lunary"
title: "Lunary information disclosure vulnerability"
description: "An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary,
  specifically in the `runs/{run_id}/related` endpoint. This endpoint does not verify
  that the user has the necessary access rights to the run(s) they are accessing.
  As a result, it returns not only the specified run but also all runs that have the
  `run_id` listed as their parent run. This issue affects the main branch, commit
  a761d833. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to obtain information about
  non-public runs and their related runs, given the `run_id` of a public or non-public
  run."
