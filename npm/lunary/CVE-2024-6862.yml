title: "Lunary Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability"
description: "A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary
  version 1.2.34 due to overly permissive CORS settings. This vulnerability allows
  an attacker to sign up for and create projects or use the instance as if they were
  a user with local access. The main attack vector is for instances hosted locally
  on personal machines, which are not publicly accessible. The CORS settings in the
  backend permit all origins, exposing unauthenticated endpoints to CSRF attacks."
