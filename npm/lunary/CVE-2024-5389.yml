title: "lunary-ai/lunary Access Control Vulnerability in Prompt Variation Management"
description: "Withdrawn: This advisory was incorrectly linked the the npm package
  `lunary`. The advisory is valid, but not for that package.\n\nIn lunary-ai/lunary
  version 1.2.13, an insufficient granularity of access control vulnerability allows
  users to create, update, get, and delete prompt variations for datasets not owned
  by their organization. This issue arises due to the application not properly validating
  the ownership of dataset prompts and their variations against the organization or
  project of the requesting user. As a result, unauthorized modifications to dataset
  prompts can occur, leading to altered or removed dataset prompts without proper
  authorization. This vulnerability impacts the integrity and consistency of dataset
  information, potentially affecting the results of experiments."
