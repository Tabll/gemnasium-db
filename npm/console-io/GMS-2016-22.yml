package_slug: "npm/console-io"
title: "Authentication Bypass"
description: "A malicious user could bypass the authentication and execute any command
  that the user who is running the console-io application is able to run. This means
  that if console-io was running from root, the attacker would have full access to
  the system. This vulnerability exists because the application does not configure
  socket.io to require authentication, which allows a malicious user to connect via
  a websocket to send commands and receive the response."
