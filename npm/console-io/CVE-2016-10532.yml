- "CVE-2016-10532"
package_slug: "npm/console-io"
title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "console-io is a module that allows users to implement a web console
  in their application. A malicious user could bypass the authentication and execute
  any command that the user who is running the console-io application 2.2.13 and earlier
  is able to run. This means that if console-io was running from root, the attacker
  would have full access to the system. This vulnerability exists because the console-io
  application does not configure socket.io to require authentication, which allows
  a malicious user to connect via a websocket to send commands and receive the response."
