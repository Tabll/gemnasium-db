package_slug: "npm/firebase-tools"
title: "Firebase vulnerable to CRSF attack"
description: "This vulnerability was a potential CSRF attack. When running the Firebase
  emulator suite, there is an export endpoint that is used normally to export data
  from running emulators. If a user was running the emulator and navigated to a malicious
  website with the exploit on a browser that allowed calls to localhost (ie Chrome
  before v94), the website could exfiltrate emulator data. We recommend upgrading
  past version 13.6.0 or [commit 068a2b08dc308c7ab4b569617f5fc8821237e3a0](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-tools/commit/068a2b08dc308c7ab4b569617f5fc8821237e3a0)."
