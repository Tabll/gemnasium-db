identifier: "CVE-2020-7766"
package_slug: "npm/json-ptr"
title: "Injection Vulnerability"
description: "This affects all versions of package json-ptr. The issue occurs in the
  set operation `https://flitbit.github.io/json-ptr/classes/_src_pointer_.jsonpointer.html#set`
  when the force flag is set to true. The function recursively sets the property in
  the target object, however it does not properly check the key being set, leading
  to a prototype pollution."
