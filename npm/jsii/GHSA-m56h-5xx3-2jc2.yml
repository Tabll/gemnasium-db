title: "Prototype pollution in jsii.configureCategories"
description: "`jsii` is a TypeScript to JavaScript compiler that also extracts an
  interface definition manifest to generate RPC stubs in various programming languages.
  jsii is typically used as a command-line tool, but it can also be loaded as a library.\nWhen
  loaded as a library into a larger application, prototype pollution may happen if
  untrusted user input is passed to the library. When used as a command line-tool,
  this pollution cannot occur."
