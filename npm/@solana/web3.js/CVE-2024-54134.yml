package_slug: "npm/@solana/web3.js"
title: "Modified package published to npm, containing malware that exfiltrates private
  key material"
description: "Earlier today, a publish-access account was compromised for `@solana/web3.js`,
  a JavaScript library that is commonly used by Solana dapps. This allowed an attacker
  to publish unauthorized and malicious packages that were modified, allowing them
  to steal private key material and drain funds from dapps, like bots, that handle
  private keys directly. This issue should not affect non-custodial wallets, as they
  generally do not expose private keys during transactions. This is not an issue with
  the Solana protocol itself, but with a specific JavaScript client library and only
  appears to affect projects that directly handle private keys and that updated within
  the window of 3:20pm UTC and 8:25pm UTC on Tuesday, December 3, 2024.\n\nThese two
  unauthorized versions (1.95.6 and 1.95.7) were caught within hours and have since
  been unpublished.\n\nWe are asking all Solana app developers to upgrade to version
  1.95.8. Developers pinned to `latest` should also upgrade to 1.95.8.\n\nDevelopers
  that suspect they might be compromised should rotate any suspect authority keys,
  including multisigs, program authorities, server keypairs, and so on."
