package_slug: "npm/@solana/pay"
title: "Always-Incorrect Control Flow Implementation"
description: "Solana Pay is a protocol and set of reference implementations that enable
  developers to incorporate decentralized payments into their apps and services. When
  a Solana Pay transaction is located using a reference key, it may be checked to
  represent a transfer of the desired amount to the recipient, using the supplied
  `validateTransfer` function. An edge case regarding this mechanism could cause the
  validation logic to validate multiple transfers. This issue has been patched as
  of version `0.2.1`. Users of the Solana Pay SDK should upgrade to it. There are
  no known workarounds for this issue."
