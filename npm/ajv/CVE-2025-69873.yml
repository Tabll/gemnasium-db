title: "ajv has ReDoS when using `$data` option"
description: "ajv (Another JSON Schema Validator) through version 8.17.1 is vulnerable
  to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) when the `$data` option is enabled.
  The pattern keyword accepts runtime data via JSON Pointer syntax (`$data` reference),
  which is passed directly to the JavaScript `RegExp()` constructor without validation.
  An attacker can inject a malicious regex pattern (e.g., `\\\"^(a|a)*$\\\"`) combined
  with crafted input to cause catastrophic backtracking. A 31-character payload causes
  approximately 44 seconds of CPU blocking, with each additional character doubling
  execution time. This enables complete denial of service with a single HTTP request
  against any API using ajv with `$data`: true for dynamic schema validation."
