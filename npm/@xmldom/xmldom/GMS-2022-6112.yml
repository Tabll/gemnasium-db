title: "Duplicate of ./npm/@xmldom/xmldom/CVE-2022-39353.yml"
description: "### Impact\nxmldom parses XML that is not well-formed because it contains
  multiple top level elements, and adds all root nodes to the `childNodes` collection
  of the `Document`, without reporting any error or throwing.\nThis breaks the assumption
  that there is only a single root node in the tree, which led to https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39299
  and is a potential issue for dependents.\n\n### Patches\nUpdate to `@xmldom/xmldom@~0.7.7`,
  `@xmldom/xmldom@~0.8.4` (dist-tag `latest`) or `@xmldom/xmldom@>=0.9.0-beta.4` (dist-tag
  `next`).\n\n### Workarounds\nOne of the following approaches might help, depending
  on your use case:\n- Instead of searching for elements in the whole DOM, only search
  in the `documentElement`.\n- Reject a document with a document that has more then
  1 `childNode`.\n\n### References\n- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39299\n-
