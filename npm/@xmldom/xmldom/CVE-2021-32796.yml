title: "Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output"
description: "xmldom is an open source pure JavaScript W3C standard-based (XML DOM
  Level 2 Core) DOMParser and XMLSerializer module. xmldom versions 0.6.0 and older
  do not correctly escape special characters when serializing elements removed from
  their ancestor. This may lead to unexpected syntactic changes during XML processing
  in some downstream applications. This issue has been resolved in version 0.7.0.
  As a workaround downstream applications can validate the input and reject the maliciously
  crafted documents."
