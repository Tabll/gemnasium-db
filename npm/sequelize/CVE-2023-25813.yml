title: "Sequelize vulnerable to SQL Injection via replacements"
description: "Sequelize is a Node.js ORM tool. In versions prior to 6.19.1 a SQL injection
  exploit exists related to replacements. Parameters which are passed through replacements
  are not properly escaped which can lead to arbitrary SQL injection depending on
  the specific queries in use. The issue has been fixed in Sequelize 6.19.1. Users
  are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should not use the `replacements`
  and the `where` option in the same query."
