title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command
  Injection')"
description: "openframe-glsviewer is a Openframe extension which adds support for
  shaders via glslViewer. openframe-glsviewer downloads binary resources over HTTP,
  which leaves it vulnerable to MITM attacks. It may be possible to cause remote code
  execution (RCE) by swapping out the requested binary with an attacker controlled
  binary if the attacker is on the network or positioned in between the user and the
  remote server."
