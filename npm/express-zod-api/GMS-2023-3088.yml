title: "Zod denial of service vulnerability during email validation"
description: "### Impact\n\nAPI servers running `express-zod-api` having:\n\n- version
  of `express-zod-api` below `10.0.0-beta1`,\n- and using the following (or similar)
  validation schema in its implementation: `z.string().email()`,\n\nis vulnerable
  to a DoS attack due to: \n\n- Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity in `zod`
  versions up to `3.22.2`,\n- depending on `zod`.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe patched version
  of `zod` fixing the vulnerability is `3.22.3`.\n\nHowever, it's highly recommended
  to upgrade `express-zod-api` to at least version `10.0.0`, which does not depend
  on `zod` strictly and directly, but requires its installation as a peer dependency
  instead, enabling you to install the patched `zod` version yourself.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nWhen
  it's not possible to upgrade your dependencies, consider the following replacement
  in your implementation:\n\n```diff\n- z.string().email()\n+ z.string().regex(\n+
  \ /^(?!\\.)(?!.*\\.\\.)([A-Z0-9_+-\\.]*)[A-Z0-9_+-]@([A-Z0-9][A-Z0-9\\-]*\\.)+[A-Z]{2,}$/i\n+
  )\n```\n\nThis regular expression is taken from the suggested patch of `zod`.\n\n###
