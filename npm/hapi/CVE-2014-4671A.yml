identifier: "CVE-2014-4671A"
package_slug: "npm/hapi"
title: "rosetta-flash jsonp vulnerability"
description: "Someone created a alphanum only swf converter, which means that they
  can in theory use it as a callback at a JSONP endpoint, and as a result, send data
  across domains. Prepending callbacks with an empty inline comment breaks the flash
  parser, and prevents the issue. This is a fairly common solution currently being
  implemented by Google, Facebook, and Github."
