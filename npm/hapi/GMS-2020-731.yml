title: "Denial of Service in hapi"
description: "All Versions of `hapi` are vulnerable to Denial of Service. The CORS
  request handler has a vulnerability which will cause the function to throw a system
  error if the header contains some invalid values. If no unhandled exception handler
  is available, the application will exist, allowing an attacker to shut down services.\n\n\n##
  Recommendation\n\nThis package is deprecated and is now maintained as `@hapi/hapi`.
  Please update your dependencies to use `@hapi/hapi`. "
