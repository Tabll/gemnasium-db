title: "Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity"
description: "This affects versions of the package angular from 1.3.0. A regular expression
  used to split the value of the ng-srcset directive is vulnerable to super-linear
  runtime due to backtracking. With a large carefully-crafted input, this can result
  in catastrophic backtracking and cause a denial of service. \r\r\r**Note:**\r\rThis
  package is EOL and will not receive any updates to address this issue. Users should
  migrate to [@angular/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/core)."
