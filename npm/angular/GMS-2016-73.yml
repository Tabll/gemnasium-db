title: "Bypass CSP protection"
description: "Extension URIs (`resource://...`) bypass ````Content-Security-Policy````
  in Chrome and Firefox and can always be loaded. Now if a site already has a XSS
  bug, and uses CSP to protect itself, but the user has an extension installed that
  uses Angular, an attacked can load Angular from the extension, and Angular's auto-bootstrapping
  can be used to bypass the victim site's CSP protection."
