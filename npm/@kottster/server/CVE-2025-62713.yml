title: "Kottster app reinitialization can be re-triggered allowing command injection
  in development mode"
description: "**Development mode only**. Kottster contains a pre-authentication remote
  code execution (RCE) vulnerability when running in development mode.\n\nThe vulnerability
  combines two issues:\n1. The `initApp` action can be called repeatedly without checking
  if the app is already initialized, allowing attackers to create a new root admin
  account and obtain a JWT token\n2. The `installPackagesForDataSource` action uses
  unescaped command arguments, enabling command injection\n\nAn attacker with access
  to a locally running development instance can chain these vulnerabilities to:\n-
  Reinitialize the application and receive a JWT token for a new root account\n- Use
  this token to authenticate\n- Execute arbitrary system commands through `installPackagesForDataSource`\n\n**Production
  deployments were never affected.**"
