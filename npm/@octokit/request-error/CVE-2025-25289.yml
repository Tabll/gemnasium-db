title: "@octokit/request-error has a Regular Expression in index that Leads to ReDoS
  Vulnerability Due to Catastrophic Backtracking"
description: "A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists
  in the processing of HTTP request headers. By sending an authorization header containing
  an excessively long sequence of spaces followed by a newline and \"@\", an attacker
  can exploit inefficient regular expression processing, leading to excessive resource
  consumption. This can significantly degrade server performance or cause a denial-of-service
  (DoS) condition, impacting availability."
