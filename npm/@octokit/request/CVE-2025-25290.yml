title: "@octokit/request has a Regular Expression in fetchWrapper that Leads to ReDoS
  Vulnerability Due to Catastrophic Backtracking"
description: "The regular expression `/<([^>]+)>; rel=\"deprecation\"/` used to match
  the `link` header in HTTP responses is vulnerable to a ReDoS (Regular Expression
  Denial of Service) attack. This vulnerability arises due to the unbounded nature
  of the regex's matching behavior, which can lead to catastrophic backtracking when
  processing specially crafted input. An attacker could exploit this flaw by sending
  a malicious `link` header, resulting in excessive CPU usage and potentially causing
  the server to become unresponsive, impacting service availability."
