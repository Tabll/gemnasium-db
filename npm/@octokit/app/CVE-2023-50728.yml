package_slug: "npm/@octokit/app"
title: "Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions"
description: "octokit/webhooks is a GitHub webhook events toolset for Node.js. Starting
  in 9.26.0 and prior to 9.26.3, 10.9.2, 11.1.2, and 12.0.4, there is a problem caused
  by an issue with error handling in the @octokit/webhooks library because the error
  can be undefined in some cases. The resulting request was found to cause an uncaught
  exception that ends the nodejs process. The bug is fixed in octokit/webhooks.js
  9.26.3, 10.9.2, 11.1.2, and 12.0.4, app.js 14.02, octokit.js 3.1.2, and Protobot
  12.3.3."
