package_slug: "npm/dom-iterator"
title: "dom-iterator code execution vulnerability"
description: "All versions of the package dom-iterator are vulnerable to Arbitrary
  Code Execution due to use of the Function constructor without complete input sanitization.
  Function generates a new function body and thus care must be given to ensure that
  the inputs to Function are not attacker-controlled. The risks involved are similar
  to that of allowing attacker-controlled input to reach eval."
