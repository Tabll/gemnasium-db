- "GHSA-jrvm-mcxc-mf6m"
package_slug: "npm/dom-iterator"
title: "dom-iterator code execution vulnerability"
description: "Versions of the package dom-iterator before 1.0.1 are vulnerable to
  Arbitrary Code Execution due to use of the Function constructor without complete
  input sanitization. Function generates a new function body and thus care must be
  given to ensure that the inputs to Function are not attacker-controlled. The risks
  involved are similar to that of allowing attacker-controlled input to reach eval."
