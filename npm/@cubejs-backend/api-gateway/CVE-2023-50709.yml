description: "Cube is a semantic layer for building data applications. Prior to version
  0.34.34, it is possible to make the entire Cube API unavailable by submitting a
  specially crafted request to a Cube API endpoint. The issue has been patched in
  `v0.34.34` and it's recommended that all users exposing Cube APIs to the public
