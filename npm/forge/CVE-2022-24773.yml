package_slug: "npm/forge"
title: "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature"
description: "Forge (also called `node-forge`) is a native implementation of Transport
  Layer Security in JavaScript. Prior to version 1.3.0, RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature
  verification code does not properly check `DigestInfo` for a proper ASN.1 structure.
  This can lead to successful verification with signatures that contain invalid structures
  but a valid digest. The issue has been addressed in `node-forge` version 1.3.0.
  There are currently no known workarounds."
