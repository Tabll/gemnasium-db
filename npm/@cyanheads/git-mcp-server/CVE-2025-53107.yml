title: "@cyanheads/git-mcp-server vulnerable to command injection in several tools"
description: "A command injection vulnerability exists in the `git-mcp-server` MCP
  Server. The vulnerability is caused by the unsanitized use of input parameters within
  a call to `child_process.exec`, enabling an attacker to inject arbitrary system
  commands. Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution under the server
  process's privileges.\n\nThe server constructs and executes shell commands using
  unvalidated user input directly within command-line strings. This introduces the
  possibility of shell metacharacter injection (`|`, `>`, `&&`, etc.)."
