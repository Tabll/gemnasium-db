title: "Insecure Cryptography Algorithm in parsel"
description: "All versions of `parsel` use an insecure cryptography algorithm. The
  package uses `aes-256-cbc` without integrity checks, which renders the ciphertext
  vulnerable to bit-flipping attacks. The package is deprecated and will not be updated.
  Consider using an alternative package."
