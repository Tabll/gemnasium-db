title: "webpack buildHttp HttpUriPlugin allowedUris bypass via HTTP redirects → SSRF
  + cache persistence"
description: "When `experiments.buildHttp` is enabled, webpack’s HTTP(S) resolver
  (`HttpUriPlugin`) enforces `allowedUris` only for the **initial** URL, but **does
  not re-validate `allowedUris` after following HTTP 30x redirects**. As a result,
  an import that appears restricted to a trusted allow-list can be redirected to **HTTP(S)
  URLs outside the allow-list**. This is a **policy/allow-list bypass** that enables
  **build-time SSRF behavior** (requests from the build machine to internal-only endpoints,
  depending on network access) and **untrusted content inclusion in build outputs**
  (redirected content is treated as module source and bundled). In my reproduction,
  the internal response is also persisted in the buildHttp cache."
