title: "Webpack's AutoPublicPathRuntimeModule has a DOM Clobbering Gadget that leads
  to XSS"
description: "We discovered a DOM Clobbering vulnerability in Webpack’s `AutoPublicPathRuntimeModule`.
  The DOM Clobbering gadget in the module can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) in
  web pages where scriptless attacker-controlled HTML elements (e.g., an `img` tag
  with an unsanitized `name` attribute) are present.\n\nWe found the real-world exploitation
  of this gadget in the Canvas LMS which allows XSS attack happens through an javascript
  code compiled by Webpack (the vulnerable part is from Webpack). We believe this
  is a severe issue. If Webpack’s code is not resilient to DOM Clobbering attacks,
  it could lead to significant security vulnerabilities in any web application using
  Webpack-compiled code."
