title: "webpack buildHttp: allowedUris allow-list bypass via URL userinfo (@) leading
  to build-time SSRF behavior"
description: "When `experiments.buildHttp` is enabled, webpack’s HTTP(S) resolver
  (`HttpUriPlugin`) can be bypassed to fetch resources from **hosts outside `allowedUris`**
  by using crafted URLs that include **userinfo** (`username:password@host`). If `allowedUris`
  enforcement relies on a **raw string prefix check** (e.g., `uri.startsWith(allowed)`),
  a URL that *looks* allow-listed can pass validation while the actual network request
  is sent to a different authority/host after URL parsing. This is a **policy/allow-list
  bypass** that enables **build-time SSRF behavior** (outbound requests from the build
  machine to internal-only endpoints, depending on network access) and **untrusted
  content inclusion** (the fetched response is treated as module source and bundled).
  In my reproduction, the internal response was also persisted in the buildHttp cache.\n\nReproduced
  on:\n- webpack version: **5.104.0**\n- Node version: **v18.19.1**"
