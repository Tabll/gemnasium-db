package_slug: "npm/tinacms"
title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "Tinacms is a Git-backed headless content management system with support
  for visual editing. Sites being built with @tinacms/cli >= 1.0.0 && < 1.0.9 which
  store sensitive values in the process.env variable are impacted. These values will
  be added in plaintext to the index.js file. If you're on a version prior to 1.0.0
  this vulnerability does not affect you. If you are affected and your Tina-enabled
  website has sensitive credentials stored as environment variables (eg. Algolia API
  keys) you should rotate those keys immediately. This issue has been patched in @tinacms/cli@1.0.9.
  Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue."
