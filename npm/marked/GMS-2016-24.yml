title: "Sanitization bypass using HTML Entities"
description: "Due to the way that marked parses input, specifically HTML entities,
  it's possible to bypass marked's content injection protection (`sanitize: true`)
  to inject a `javascript:` URL. This flaw exists because `&#xNNanything;` gets parsed
  to what it could and leaves the rest behind, resulting in just `anything;` being
  left. "
