title: "Marked allows Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks"
description: "Marked prior to version 0.3.17 is vulnerable to a Regular Expression
  Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack due to catastrophic backtracking in several regular
  expressions used for parsing HTML tags and markdown links. An attacker can exploit
  this vulnerability by providing specially crafted markdown input, such as deeply
  nested or repetitively structured brackets or tag attributes, which cause the parser
  to hang and lead to a Denial of Service."
