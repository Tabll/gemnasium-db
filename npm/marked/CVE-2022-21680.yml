title: "Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity"
description: "The regular expression `block.def`
  may cause catastrophic backtracking against some strings and lead to a regular expression
  denial of service (ReDoS). Anyone who runs untrusted markdown through a vulnerable
  version of marked and does not use a worker with a time limit may be affected. This
  issue is patched As a workaround, avoid running untrusted markdown through marked
  or run marked on a worker thread and set a reasonable time limit to prevent draining
  resources."
