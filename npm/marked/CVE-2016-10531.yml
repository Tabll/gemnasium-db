identifier: "CVE-2016-10531"
package_slug: "npm/marked"
title: "Cross-site Scripting"
description: "Due to the way that marked parses input, specifically HTML entities,
  it's possible to bypass marked's content injection protection (`sanitize: true`)
  to inject a `javascript:` URL. This flaw exists because `&#xNNanything;` gets parsed
  to what it could and leaves the rest behind, resulting in just `anything;` being
  left."
