identifier: "CVE-2016-10531"
package_slug: "npm/marked"
title: "Cross-site Scripting"
description: "Due to the way that marked and earlier parses input, specifically HTML
  entities, it's possible to bypass marked's content injection protection (`sanitize:
  true`) to inject a `javascript:` URL. This flaw exists because `&#xNNanything;`
  gets parsed to what it could and leaves the rest behind, resulting in just `anything;`
  being left."
