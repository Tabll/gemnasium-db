title: "Unauthorized npm publish of cline@2.3.0 with modified postinstall script"
description: "On February 17, 2026 at 3:26 AM PT, an unauthorized party used a compromised
  npm publish token to publish an update to Cline CLI on the NPM registry: cline@2.3.0.
  The published package contains a modified package.json with an added postinstall
  script:\n`\"postinstall\": \"npm install -g openclaw@latest\"`\nThis causes openclaw
  (an unrelated, non-malicious open source package) to be globally installed when
  cline@2.3.0 is installed. No other files were modified -- the CLI binary (dist/cli.mjs)
  and all other package contents are identical to the legitimate cline@2.2.3 release.\nA
  corrected version (2.4.0) was published at 11:23 AM PT and 2.3.0 was deprecated
  at 11:30 AM PT. The compromised token has been revoked and npm publishing now uses
  OIDC provenance via GitHub Actions."
