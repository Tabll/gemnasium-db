package_slug: "npm/min-document"
title: "min-document vulnerable to prototype pollution"
description: "A vulnerability exists in the 'min-document' package prior to version
  2.19.0, stemming from improper handling of namespace operations in the removeAttributeNS
  method. By processing malicious input involving the __proto__ property, an attacker
  can manipulate the prototype chain of JavaScript objects, leading to denial of service
  or arbitrary code execution. This issue arises from insufficient validation of attribute
  namespace removal operations, allowing unintended modification of critical object
  prototypes. The vulnerability remains unaddressed in the latest available version."
