package_slug: "npm/@coding-solo/godot-mcp"
title: "godot-mcp has Command Injection via unsanitized projectPath"
description: "A Command Injection vulnerability in godot-mcp allows remote code execution.
  The `executeOperation` function passed user-controlled input (e.g., `projectPath`)
  directly to `exec()`, which spawns a shell. An attacker could inject shell metacharacters
  like `$(command)` or `&calc` to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of
  the MCP server process.\n\nThis affects any tool that accepts `projectPath`, including
  `create_scene`, `add_node`, `load_sprite`, and others."
