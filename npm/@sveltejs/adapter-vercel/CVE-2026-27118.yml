title: "Cache poisoning in @sveltejs/adapter-vercel"
description: "Versions of `@sveltejs/adapter-vercel` prior to 6.3.2 are vulnerable
  to cache poisoning. An internal query parameter intended for Incremental Static
  Regeneration (ISR) is accessible on all routes, allowing an attacker to cause sensitive
  user-specific responses to be cached and served to other users.\n\nSuccessful exploitation
  requires a victim to visit an attacker-controlled link while authenticated.\n\nExisting
  deployments are protected by Vercel's WAF, but users should upgrade as soon as possible."
