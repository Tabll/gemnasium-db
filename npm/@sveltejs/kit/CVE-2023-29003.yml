title: "Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs"
description: "SvelteKit is a web development framework. The SvelteKit framework offers
  developers an option to create simple REST APIs. This is done by defining a `+server.js`
  file, containing endpoint handlers for different HTTP methods. SvelteKit provides
  out-of-the-box cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection to its users. While
  the implementation does a sufficient job in mitigating common CSRF attacks, prior
  to version 1.15.1, the protection can be bypassed by simply specifying a different
  `Content-Type` header value. If abused, this issue will allow malicious requests
  to be submitted from third-party domains, which can allow execution of operations
  within the context of the victim's session, and in extreme scenarios can lead to
  unauthorized access to usersâ€™ accounts. SvelteKit 1.15.1 updates the `is_form_content_type`
  function call in the CSRF protection logic to include `text/plain`. As additional
  hardening of the CSRF protection mechanism against potential method overrides, SvelteKit
  1.15.1 is now performing validation on `PUT`, `PATCH` and `DELETE` methods as well.
  This latter hardening is only needed to protect users who have put in some sort
  of `?_method= override` feature themselves in their `handle` hook, so that the request
  that resolve sees could be `PUT`/`PATCH`/`DELETE` when the browser issues a `POST`
  request."
