package_slug: "npm/@sveltejs/adapter-node"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "SvelteKit is a web development kit. In SvelteKit 2, sending a GET request
  with a body eg `{}` to a built and previewed/hosted sveltekit app throws `Request
  with GET/HEAD method cannot have body.` and crashes the preview/hosting. After this
  happens, one must manually restart the app. `TRACE` requests will also cause the
  app to crash. Prerendered pages and SvelteKit 1 apps are not affected. `@sveltejs/adapter-node`
  versions 2.1.2, 3.0.3, and 4.0.1 and `@sveltejs/kit` version 2.4.3 contain a patch
  for this issue."
