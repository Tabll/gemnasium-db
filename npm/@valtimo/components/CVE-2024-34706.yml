title: "@valtimo/components exposes access token to form.io"
description: "When opening a form in Valtimo, the access token (JWT) of the user is
  exposed to `api.form.io` via the the `x-jwt-token` header. An attacker can retrieve
  personal information from this token, or use it to execute requests to the Valtimo
  REST API on behalf of the logged-in user.\n\nThis issue is caused by a misconfiguration
  of the Form.io component."
