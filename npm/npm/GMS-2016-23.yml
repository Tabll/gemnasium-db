title: "npm Token Leak"
description: "The primary npm registry has, since late, used HTTP bearer tokens to
  authenticate requests from the npm command-line interface. Due to a design flaw
  in the CLI, these bearer tokens were sent with every request made by the CLI for
  logged-in users, regardless of the destination of the request. They should instead
  only be included for requests made against the registry or registries used for the
  current install. This flaw allows an attacker to set up an HTTP server that could
  collect authentication information they could use to impersonate the users whose
  tokens they collected. This impersonation would allow them to do anything the compromised
  users could do, including publishing new versions of packages."
