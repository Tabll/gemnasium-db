package_slug: "npm/npm"
title: "Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity"
description: "This CVE has been marked as a False Positive as it only concerns the npm cli tool."
#description: "The npm ci command in npm proceeds with an installation even if dependency
#  information in `package-lock.json` differs from `package.json`. This behavior is
#  inconsistent with the documentation, and makes it easier for attackers to install
#  malware that was supposed to have been blocked by an exact version match requirement
#  in `package-lock.json`."
