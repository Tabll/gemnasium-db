package_slug: "npm/dectalk-tts"
title: "dectalk-tts Uses Unencrypted HTTP Request"
description: "In `dectalk-tts@1.0.0`, network requests to the third-party API are
  sent over HTTP, which is unencrypted. Unencrypted traffic can be easily intercepted
  and modified by attackers. Anyone who uses the package could be the victim of a
  [man-in-the-middle (MITM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack)
  attack.\n\n<ins>Theft</ins>\n\nBecause `dectalk-tts` is a text-to-speech package,
  user requests are expected to only contain natural language. The package [README](https://github.com/JstnMcBrd/dectalk-tts/blob/main/README.md)
  warns that user input is sent to a third-party API, so users should not send sensitive
  information regardless.\n\nBut if users ignore the warnings and send sensitive information
  anyway, that information could be stolen by attackers.\n\n<ins>Modification</ins>\n\nAttackers
  could manipulate requests to the API. However, the worst a modified request could
  do is return an incorrect audio file or bad request rejection.\n\nAttackers could
  also manipulate responses from the API, returning malicious output to the user.
  Output is expected to be a wav-encoded buffer, which users will likely save to a
  file. This could be a dangerous entrypoint to the user's filesystem."
