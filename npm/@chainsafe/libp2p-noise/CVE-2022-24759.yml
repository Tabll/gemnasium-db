package_slug: "npm/@chainsafe/libp2p-noise"
title: "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature"
description: "`@chainsafe/libp2p-noise` contains TypeScript implementation of noise
  protocol, an encryption protocol used in libp2p. `@chainsafe/libp2p-noise` before
  4.1.2 and 5.0.3 does not correctly validate signatures during the handshake process.
  This may allow a man-in-the-middle to pose as other peers and get those peers banned.
  Users should upgrade to version 4.1.2 or 5.0.3 to receive a patch. There are currently
  no known workarounds."
