title: "URL parsing in node-forge could lead to undesired behavior."
description: "### Impact\nThe regex used for the `forge.util.parseUrl` API would not
  properly parse certain inputs resulting in a parsed data structure that could lead
  to undesired behavior.\n\n### Patches\n`forge.util.parseUrl` and other very old
  related URL APIs were removed in 1.0.0 in favor of letting applications use the
  more modern WHATWG URL Standard API.\n\n### Workarounds\nEnsure code does not directly
  or indirectly call `forge.util.parseUrl` with untrusted input.\n\n### References\n-
  https://www.huntr.dev/bounties/41852c50-3c6d-4703-8c55-4db27164a4ae/\n\n### For
