title: "Prototype Pollution in node-forge debug API."
description: "### Impact\nThe `forge.debug` API had a potential prototype pollution
  issue if called with untrusted input. The API was only used for internal debug purposes
  in a safe way and never documented or advertised.  It is suspected that uses of
  this API, if any exist, would likely not have used untrusted inputs in a vulnerable
  way.\n\n### Patches\nThe `forge.debug` API and related functions were removed in
  1.0.0.\n\n### Workarounds\nDon't use the `forge.debug` API directly or indirectly
  with untrusted input.\n\n### References\n- https://www.huntr.dev/bounties/1-npm-node-forge/\n\n###
  For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n*
