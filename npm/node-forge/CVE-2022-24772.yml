package_slug: "npm/node-forge"
title: "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature"
description: "Forge (also called `node-forge`) is a native implementation of Transport
  Layer Security in JavaScript. Prior to version 1.3.0, RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature
  verification code does not check for tailing garbage bytes after decoding a `DigestInfo`
  ASN.1 structure. This can allow padding bytes to be removed and garbage data added
  to forge a signature when a low public exponent is being used. The issue has been
  addressed in `node-forge` version 1.3.0. There are currently no known workarounds."
