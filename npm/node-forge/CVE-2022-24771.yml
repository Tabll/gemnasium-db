package_slug: "npm/node-forge"
title: "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature"
description: "Forge (also called `node-forge`) is a native implementation of Transport
  Layer Security in JavaScript. Prior to version 1.3.0, RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature
  verification code is lenient in checking the digest algorithm structure. This can
  allow a crafted structure that steals padding bytes and uses unchecked portion of
  the PKCS#1 encoded message to forge a signature when a low public exponent is being
  used. The issue has been addressed in `node-forge` version 1.3.0. There are currently
  no known workarounds."
