title: "Svelte SSR attribute spreading includes inherited properties from prototype
  chain"
description: "In server-side rendering, attribute spreading on elements (e.g. `<div
  {...attrs}>`) enumerates inherited properties from the object's prototype chain
  rather than only own properties. In environments where `Object.prototype` has already
  been polluted — a precondition outside of Svelte's control — this can cause unexpected
  attributes to appear in SSR output or cause SSR to throw errors. Client-side rendering
  is not affected."
