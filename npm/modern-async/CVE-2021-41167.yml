description: "modern-async is an open source JavaScript tooling library for asynchronous
  operations using async/await and promises. They should limit the concurrency of
  some actions but, in practice, they don't. Any code calling these functions will
  be written thinking they would limit the concurrency but they won't. This could
  lead to potential security issues in other projects. The problem has been patched
  There is no workaround."
