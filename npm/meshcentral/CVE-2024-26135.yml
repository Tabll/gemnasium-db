title: "Origin Validation Error"
description: "MeshCentral is a full computer management web site. Versions prior to
  1.1.21 a cross-site websocket hijacking (CSWSH) vulnerability within the control.ashx
  endpoint. This component is the primary mechanism used within MeshCentral to perform
  administrative actions on the server. The vulnerability is exploitable when an attacker
  is able to convince a victim end-user to click on a malicious link to a page hosting
  an attacker-controlled site. The attacker can then originate a cross-site websocket
  connection using client-side JavaScript code to connect to `control.ashx` as the
  victim user within MeshCentral. Version 1.1.21 contains a patch for this issue."
