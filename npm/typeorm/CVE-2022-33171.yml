title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')"
description: "The findOne function in TypeORM before 0.3.0 can either be supplied
  with a string or a FindOneOptions object. When input to the function is a user-controlled
  parsed JSON object, supplying a crafted FindOneOptions instead of an id string leads
  to SQL injection. NOTE: the vendor's position is that the user's application is
  responsible for input validation"
