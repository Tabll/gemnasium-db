title: "Directory Traversal in wenluhong1"
description: "Affected versions of `wenluhong1` resolve relative file paths, resulting
  in a directory traversal vulnerability. A malicious actor can use this vulnerability
  to access files outside of the intended directory root, which may result in the
  disclosure of private files on the vulnerable system.\n\nExample request:\n```\nGET
  /../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1\nhost:foo\n```\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo
  patch is available for this vulnerability.\n\nIt is recommended that the package
  is only used for local development, and if the functionality is needed for production,
  a different package is used instead."
