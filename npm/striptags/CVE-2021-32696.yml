identifier: "CVE-2021-32696"
package_slug: "npm/striptags"
title: "Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type (Type Confusion)"
description: "The npm package `striptags` is an implementation of PHP's strip_tags
  in Typescript. In striptags, a type-confusion vulnerability can cause `striptags`
  to concatenate unsanitized strings when an array-like object is passed in as the
  `html` parameter. This can be abused by an attacker who can control the shape of
  their input, e.g. if query parameters are passed directly into the function. This
  can lead to a XSS."
