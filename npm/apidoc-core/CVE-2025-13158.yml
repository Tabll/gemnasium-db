title: "apidoc-core has a prototype pollution vulnerability"
description: "Prototype pollution vulnerability in apidoc-core versions 0.2.0 and
  all subsequent versions allows remote attackers to modify JavaScript object prototypes
  via malformed data structures, including the “define” property processed by the
  application, potentially leading to denial of service or unintended behavior in
  applications relying on the integrity of prototype chains. This affects the preProcess()
  function in api_group.js, api_param_title.js, api_use.js, and api_permission.js
  worker modules."
