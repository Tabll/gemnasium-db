package_slug: "npm/@soketi/soketi"
title: "Denial of Service in soketi"
description: "### Impact\n_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nThere
  was a wrong behavior when reading POST requests, making the server crash if it couldn't
  read the body. In case a POST request was sent to any endpoint of the server with
  an empty body, **even unauthenticated with the Pusher Protocol**, it would simply
  just crash the server for trying to send a response after the request closed.\n\nAll
  users that run the server are affected by it and it's highly recommended to upgrade
  to the latest patch.\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions
  should users upgrade to?_\n\nUpdating to at least or the latest version.\n\n###
  Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without
  upgrading?_\n\nNo. Upgrading is the only solution.\n\n### References\n_Are there
  any links users can visit to find out more?_\n\nhttps://github.com/soketi/soketi/releases/tag/0.24.1\n\n###
