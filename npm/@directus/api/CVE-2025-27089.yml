title: "Directus allows updates to non-allowed fields due to overlapping policies"
description: "If there are two overlapping policies for the `update` action that allow
  access to different fields, instead of correctly checking access permissions against
  the item they apply for the user is allowed to update the superset of fields allowed
  by any of the policies.\n\nE.g. have one policy allowing update access to `field_a`
  if the `id == 1` and one policy allowing update access to `field_b` if the `id ==
  2`. The user with both these policies is allowed to update both `field_a` and `field_b`
  for the items with ids `1` and `2`."
