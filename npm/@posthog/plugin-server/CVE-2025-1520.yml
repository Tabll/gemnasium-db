description: "PostHog ClickHouse Table Functions SQL Injection Remote Code Execution
  Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary
  code on affected installations of PostHog. Authentication is required to exploit
  this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the implementation of the
  SQL parser. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied
  string before using it to construct SQL queries. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability
  to execute code in the context of the database account. Was ZDI-CAN-25350."
