package_slug: "npm/nanoid"
title: "Predictable results in nanoid generation when given non-integer values"
description: "When nanoid is called with a fractional value, there were a number of
  undesirable effects:\n\n1. in browser and non-secure, the code infinite loops on
  while (size--)\n2. in node, the value of poolOffset becomes fractional, causing
  calls to nanoid to return zeroes until the pool is next filled\n3. if the first
  call in node is a fractional argument, the initial buffer allocation fails with
  an error\n\nVersion 3.3.8 and 5.0.9 are fixed."
