title: "@jmondi/url-to-png enables capture screenshot of localhost web services (unauthenticated
  pages)"
description: "The maintainer been contemplating whether FTP or other protocols could
  serve as useful functionalities, but there may not be a practical reason for it
  since we are utilizing headless Chrome to capture screenshots. The argument is based
  on the assumption that this package can function as a service.\n\nThe package includes
  an `ALLOW_LIST` where the host can specify which services the user is permitted
  to capture screenshots of. By default, capturing screenshots of web services running
  on localhost, 127.0.0.1, or the [::] is allowed.\n\nThe maintainer is of the opinion
  that the package should also have a denylist due to a potential vulnerability (or
  rather design oversight). If someone hosts this on a server, users could then capture
  screenshots of other web services running locally.\n\nUnless this is strictly for
  web pages. Something similar here: https://github.com/follow-redirects/follow-redirects/issues/235
  (localhost is intended for end users or hosts to deny, and the package is for HTTP/HTTPS.)\n\nThis
  is marked as a `LOW` since the maintainer is not sure if this is a vulnerability,
  but it's still best to highlight it. :)"
