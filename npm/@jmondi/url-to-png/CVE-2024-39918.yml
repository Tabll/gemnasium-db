title: "@jmondi/url-to-png contains a Path Traversal vulnerability"
description: "When trying to add a `BLOCK_LIST` feature when the maintainer noticed
  they didn't sanitize the `ImageId` in the code, which leads to path traversal vulnerability.
  Now, this is different from a traditional path traversal issue, because as of NOW
  you can store the image in any place arbitrarily, and given enough time they might
  be able to come up with a working exploit BUT for the time being they am reporting
  this."
