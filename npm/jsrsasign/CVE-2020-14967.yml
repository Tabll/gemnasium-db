package_slug: "npm/jsrsasign"
title: "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer"
description: "An issue was discovered in the jsrsasign package for Node.js. Its RSA
  PKCS1 v1.5 decryption implementation does not detect ciphertext modification by
  prepending `\\0` bytes to ciphertexts (it decrypts modified ciphertexts without
  error). An attacker might prepend these bytes with the goal of triggering memory
  corruption issues."
