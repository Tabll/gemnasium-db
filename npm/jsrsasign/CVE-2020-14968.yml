package_slug: "npm/jsrsasign"
title: "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer"
description: "An issue was discovered in the jsrsasign package for Node.js. Its RSASSA-PSS
  (RSA-PSS) implementation does not detect signature manipulation/modification by
  prepending `\\0` bytes to a signature (it accepts these modified signatures as valid).
  An attacker can abuse this behavior in an application by creating multiple valid
  signatures where only one signature should exist. Also, an attacker might prepend
  these bytes with the goal of triggering memory corruption issues."
