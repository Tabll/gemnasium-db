package_slug: "npm/jsrsasign"
title: "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature"
description: "An issue was discovered in the jsrsasign package for Node.js. It allows
  a malleability in ECDSA signatures by not checking overflows in the length of a
  sequence and `0` characters appended or prepended to an integer. The modified signatures
  are verified as valid. This could have a security-relevant impact if an application
  relied on a single canonical signature."
