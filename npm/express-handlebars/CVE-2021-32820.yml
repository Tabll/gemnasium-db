package_slug: "npm/express-handlebars"
title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "Express-handlebars is a Handlebars view engine for Express. Express-handlebars
  mixes pure template data with engine configuration options through the Express render
  API. More specifically, the layout parameter may trigger file disclosure vulnerabilities
  in downstream applications. This potential vulnerability is somewhat restricted
  in that only files with existing extentions (i.e. file.extension) can be included,
  files that lack an extension will have .handlebars appended to them. For complete
  details refer to the referenced GHSL-2021-018 report. Notes in documentation have
  been added to help users avoid this potential information exposure vulnerability."
