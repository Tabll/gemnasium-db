title: "Insecure Defaults Allow MITM Over TLS"
description: "There's a flaw in the way that node.js handles the `rejectUnauthorized`
  setting. If the value is something that evaluates to false, certificate verification
  will be disabled. This is problematic as engine.io-client passes in an object for
  settings that includes the `rejectUnauthorized` property, whether it has been set
  or not. If the value has not been explicitly changed, it will be passed in as `null`,
  resulting in certificate verification being turned off."
