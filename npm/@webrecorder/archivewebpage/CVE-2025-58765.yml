title: "Webrecorder packages are vulnerable to XSS through 404 error handling logic"
description: "A Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the 404
  error handling logic of wabac.js v2.23.10 and below. The parameter `requestURL`
  (derived from the original request target) is directly embedded into an inline `<script>`
  block without sanitization or escaping.\n\nThis allows an attacker to craft a malicious
  URL that executes arbitrary JavaScript in the victimâ€™s browser.\n\nThe scope may
  be limited by CORS policies, depending on the situation in which wabac.js is used."
