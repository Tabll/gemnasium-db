title: "JavaScript SDK v2 users should add validation to the region parameter value
  in or migrate to v3"
description: "CVSSv3.1 Rating: 3.7 (LOW)\n\nSummary\nThis notification is related
  to the use of specific values for the region input field when calling AWS services.
  An actor with access to the environment in which the SDK is used could set the region
  input field to an invalid value. Per the AWS shared responsibility model, customer
  applications should protect instances appropriately, or implement proper input sanitization
  checks. The AWS SDK for JavaScript v2 reached end-of-support on September 8, 2025,
  but a defense-in-depth enhancement has been implemented in AWS SDK for JavaScript
  v3. Please migrate to that version.\n\nImpact\nCustomer applications could be configured
  to improperly route AWS API calls to non-existent or non-AWS hosts. While the SDK
  itself is functioning as designed, we recommend customers migrate to AWS SDK for
  JavaScript v3 for continued support and enhanced security features.\n\nImpacted
  versions: All versions of AWS SDK for JavaScript v2\n\nPatches\nNo security patch
  is required, this is an informational advisory.\n\nWorkarounds\n- Implement proper
  input sanitization in your application code\n- Migrate to AWS SDK for JavaScript
  v3\n- Follow AWS security best practices for SDK configuration\n\nReferences\nContact
  AWS Security via the vulnerability reporting page or email [aws-security@amazon.com](mailto:aws-security@amazon.com).\n\nAcknowledgement\nAWS
  Security thanks Guy Arazi for bringing these customer security considerations to
  our attention through the coordinated disclosure process."
