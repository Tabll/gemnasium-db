title: "set-in Affected by Prototype Pollution"
description: "A prototype pollution vulnerability exists in the the npm package set-in
  (>=2.0.1). Despite a previous fix that attempted to mitigate prototype pollution
  by checking whether user input contained a forbidden key, it is still possible to

  fixed in version 2.0.5."
