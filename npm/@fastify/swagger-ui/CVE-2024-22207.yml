description: "fastify-swagger-ui is a Fastify plugin for serving Swagger UI. Prior
  to 2.1.0, the default configuration of `@fastify/swagger-ui` without `baseDir` set
  will lead to all files in the module's directory being exposed via http routes served
  by the module. The vulnerability is fixed in v2.1.0. Setting the `baseDir` option
  can also work around this vulnerability."
