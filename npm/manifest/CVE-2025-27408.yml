package_slug: "npm/manifest"
title: "Manifest Uses a One-Way Hash without a Salt"
description: "Manifest employs a weak password hashing implementation that uses SHA3
  without a salt. This exposes user passwords to a higher risk of being cracked if
  an attacker gains access to the database. Without the use of a salt, identical passwords
  across multiple users will result in the same hash, making it easier for attackers
  to identify and exploit patterns, thereby accelerating the cracking process."
