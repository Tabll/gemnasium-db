description: "jsx-slack is a package for building JSON objects for Slack block kit
  surfaces from JSX. The maintainers found the patch for CVE-2021-43838 in jsx-slack
  v4.5.1 is insufficient tfor protection from a Regular Expression Denial of Service
  (ReDoS) attack. If an attacker can put a lot of JSX elements into `<blockquote>`
  tag _with including multibyte characters_, an internal regular expression for escaping
  characters may consume an excessive amount of computing resources. v4.5.1 passes
  the test against ASCII characters but misses the case of multibyte characters. jsx-slack
  v4.5.2 has updated regular expressions for escaping blockquote characters to prevent
  catastrophic backtracking. It is also including an updated test case to confirm
  rendering multiple tags in `<blockquote>` with multibyte characters."
