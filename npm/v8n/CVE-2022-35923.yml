title: "Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity"
description: "v8n is a javascript validation library. Versions of v8n prior to 1.5.1
  were found to have an inefficient regular expression complexity in the `lowercase()`
  and `uppercase()` regex which could lead to a denial of service attack. In testing
  of the `lowercase()` function a payload of 'a' + 'a'.repeat(i) + 'A' with 32 leading
  characters took 29443 ms to execute. The same issue happens with uppercase(). Users
  are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue."
