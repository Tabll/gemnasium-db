title: "MongoDB Shell may be susceptible to control character Injection via shell
  output"
description: "The MongoDB Shell may be susceptible to control character injection
  where an attacker with control over the database cluster contents can inject control
  characters into the shell output. This may result in the display of falsified messages
  that appear to originate from mongosh or the underlying operating system, potentially
  misleading users into executing unsafe actions.\n\nThe vulnerability is exploitable
  only when mongosh is connected to a cluster that is partially or fully controlled
  by an attacker.\n\nThis issue affects mongosh versions prior to 2.3.9."
