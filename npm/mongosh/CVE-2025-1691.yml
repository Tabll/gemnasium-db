title: "MongoDB Shell may be susceptible to Control Character Injection via autocomplete"
description: "The MongoDB Shell may be susceptible to control character injection
  where an attacker with control of the mongosh autocomplete feature, can use the
  autocompletion feature to input and run obfuscated malicious text. This requires
  user interaction in the form of the user using ‘tab’ to autocomplete text that is
  a prefix of the attacker’s prepared autocompletion. This issue affects mongosh versions
  prior to 2.3.9.\n\nThe vulnerability is exploitable only when mongosh is connected
  to a cluster that is partially or fully controlled by an attacker."
