package_slug: "npm/serialize-javascript"
title: "Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in serialize-javascript"
description: "A flaw was found in npm-serialize-javascript. The vulnerability occurs
  because the serialize-javascript module does not properly sanitize certain inputs,
  such as regex or other JavaScript object types, allowing an attacker to inject malicious
  code. This code could be executed when deserialized by a web browser, causing Cross-site
  scripting (XSS) attacks. This issue is critical in environments where serialized
  data is sent to web clients, potentially compromising the security of the website
  or web application using this package."
