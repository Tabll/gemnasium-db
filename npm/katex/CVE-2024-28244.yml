package_slug: "npm/katex"
title: "KaTeX's maxExpand bypassed by Unicode sub/superscripts"
description: "KaTeX users who render untrusted mathematical expressions could encounter
  malicious input using `\\def` or `\\newcommand` that causes a near-infinite loop,
  despite setting `maxExpand` to avoid such loops. This can be used as an availability
  attack, where e.g. a client rendering another user's KaTeX input will be unable
  to use the site due to memory overflow, tying up the main thread, or stack overflow."
