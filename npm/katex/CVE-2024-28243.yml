title: "KaTeX's maxExpand bypassed by `\\edef`"
description: "KaTeX users who render untrusted mathematical expressions could encounter
  malicious input using `\\edef` that causes a near-infinite loop, despite setting
  `maxExpand` to avoid such loops. This can be used as an availability attack, where
  e.g. a client rendering another user's KaTeX input will be unable to use the site
  due to memory overflow, tying up the main thread, or stack overflow."
