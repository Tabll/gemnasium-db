title: "pnpm v10+ Bypass \"Dependency lifecycle scripts execution disabled by default\""
description: "A security bypass vulnerability in pnpm v10+ allows git-hosted dependencies
  to execute arbitrary code during `pnpm install`, circumventing the v10 security
  feature \"Dependency lifecycle scripts execution disabled by default\". While pnpm
  v10 blocks `postinstall` scripts via the `onlyBuiltDependencies` mechanism, git
  dependencies can still execute `prepare`, `prepublish`, and `prepack` scripts during
  the fetch phase, enabling remote code execution without user consent or approval."
