package_slug: "npm/pnpm"
title: "pnpm has symlink traversal in file:/git dependencies"
description: "When pnpm installs a `file:` (directory) or `git:` dependency, it follows
  symlinks and reads their target contents without constraining them to the package
  root. A malicious package containing a symlink to an absolute path (e.g., `/etc/passwd`,
  `~/.ssh/id_rsa`) causes pnpm to copy that file's contents into `node_modules`, leaking
  local data.\n\n**Preconditions:** Only affects `file:` and `git:` dependencies.
  Registry packages (npm) have symlinks stripped during publish and are NOT affected."
