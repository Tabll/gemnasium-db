title: "pnpm: Binary ZIP extraction allows arbitrary file write via path traversal
  (Zip Slip)"
description: "A path traversal vulnerability in pnpm's binary fetcher allows malicious
  packages to write files outside the intended extraction directory. The vulnerability
  has two attack vectors: (1) Malicious ZIP entries containing `../` or absolute paths
  that escape the extraction root via AdmZip's `extractAllTo`, and (2) The `BinaryResolution.prefix`
  field is concatenated into the extraction path without validation, allowing a crafted
  prefix like `../../evil` to redirect extracted files outside `targetDir`."
