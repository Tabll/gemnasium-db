title: "pnpm scoped bin name Path Traversal allows arbitrary file creation outside
  node_modules/.bin"
description: "A path traversal vulnerability in pnpm's bin linking allows malicious
  npm packages to create executable shims or symlinks outside of `node_modules/.bin`.
  Bin names starting with `@` bypass validation, and after scope normalization, path
  traversal sequences like `../../` remain intact."
