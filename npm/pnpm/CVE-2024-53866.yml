package_slug: "npm/pnpm"
title: "pnpm no-script global cache poisoning via overrides / `ignore-scripts` evasion"
description: "pnpm seems to mishandle overrides and global cache:\n1. Overrides from
  one workspace leak into npm metadata saved in global cache\n2. npm metadata from
  global cache affects other workspaces\n3. installs by default don't revalidate the
  data (including on first lockfile generation)\n\nThis can make workspace A (even
  running with `ignore-scripts=true`) posion global cache and execute scripts in workspace
  B\n\nUsers generally expect `ignore-scripts` to be sufficient to prevent immediate
  code execution on install (e.g. when the tree is just repacked/bundled without executing
  it).\n\nHere, that expectation is broken"
