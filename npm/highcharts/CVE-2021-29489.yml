package_slug: "npm/highcharts"
title: "Cross-site Scripting"
description: "Highcharts JS is a JavaScript charting library based on SVG. In Highcharts,
  the chart options structure was not systematically filtered for XSS vectors. The
  potential impact was that content from untrusted sources could execute code in the
  end user's browser. The vulnerability is patched As a workaround, implementers who
  are not able to upgrade may apply DOMPurify recursively to the options structure
  to filter out malicious markup."
