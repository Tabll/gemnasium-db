identifier: "GMS-2018-5"
package_slug: "npm/augustine"
title: "Directory Traversal"
description: "A crafted GET request can be leveraged to traverse the directory structure
  of a host using the `augustine` web server package, and request arbitrary files
  outside of the specified web root. This allows for a remote attacker to gain access
  to arbitrary files on the filesystem that the process has access to read. Mitigating
  factors: Only files that the user running `augustine`Â has permission to read will
  be accessible via this vulnerability."
