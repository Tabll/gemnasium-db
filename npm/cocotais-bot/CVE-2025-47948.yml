package_slug: "npm/cocotais-bot"
title: "Cocotais Bot has builtin .echo command injection"
description: "A command echoing feature in the framework allows users to
  indirectly trigger privileged behavior by injecting special platform tags.
  Specifically, an unauthorized user can use the `/echo <qqbot-at-everyone />`
  command to cause the bot to send a message that mentions all members in the
  chat, bypassing any permission controls. This can lead to spam, disruption,
  or abuse of notification systems."
