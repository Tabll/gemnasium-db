title: "Lettermint Node.js SDK leaks email properties to unintended recipients when
  client instance is reused"
description: "Email properties (such as to, subject, html, text, and attachments)
  are not reset between sends when a single client instance is reused across multiple
  .send() calls. This can cause properties from a previous send to leak into a subsequent
  one, potentially delivering content or recipient addresses to unintended parties.
  Applications sending emails to different recipients in sequence — such as transactional
  flows like password resets or notifications — are affected."
