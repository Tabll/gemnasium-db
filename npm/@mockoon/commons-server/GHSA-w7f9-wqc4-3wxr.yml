title: "Mockoon has a Path Traversal and LFI in the static file serving endpoint"
description: "A mock API configuration for static file serving following the same
  approach presented in the [documentation page](https://mockoon.com/tutorials/create-endpoint-serving-static-file/),
  where the server filename is generated via templating features from user input is
  vulnerable to Path Traversal and LFI, allowing an attacker to get any file in the
  mock server filesystem.\nThe issue may be particularly relevant in cloud hosted
  server instances"
