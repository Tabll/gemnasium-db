title: "Duplicate Advisory: Prototype Pollution in klona"
description: "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-8f89-2fwj-5v5r. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n## Original Description\nVersions of `klona` prior to 1.1.1 are vulnerable
  to prototype pollution. The package does not restrict the modification of an Object's
  prototype when cloning objects, which may allow an attacker to add or modify an
  existing property that will exist on all objects.\n\n\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade
  to version 1.1.1 or later."
