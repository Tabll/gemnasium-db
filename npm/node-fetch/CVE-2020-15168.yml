identifier: "CVE-2020-15168"
package_slug: "npm/node-fetch"
title: "Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling"
description: "node-fetch did not honor the size option after following a redirect,
  which means that when a content size was over the limit, a FetchError would never
  get thrown and the process would end without failure. For most people, this fix
  will have a little or no impact. However, if you are relying on node-fetch to gate
  files above a size, the impact could be significant, for example: If you don't double-check
  the size of the data after `fetch()` has completed, your JS thread could get tied
  up doing work on a large file (DoS) and/or cost you money in computing."
