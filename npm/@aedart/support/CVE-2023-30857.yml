package_slug: "npm/@aedart/support"
title: "Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype
  Pollution')"
description: "@aedart/support is the support package for Ion, a monorepo for JavaScript/TypeScript
  packages. Prior to version `0.6.1`, there is a possible prototype pollution issue
  for the `MetadataRecord`, when merged with a base class' metadata object, in `meta`
  decorator from the `@aedart/support` package. The likelihood of exploitation is
  questionable, given that a class's metadata can only be set or altered when the
  class is decorated via `meta()`. Furthermore, object(s) of sensitive nature would
  have to be stored as metadata, before this can lead to a security impact. The issue
  has been patched in version `0.6.1`.\n"
