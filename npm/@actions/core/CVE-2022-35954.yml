package_slug: "npm/@actions/core"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream
  Component ('Injection')"
description: "The GitHub Actions ToolKit provides a set of packages to make creating
  actions easier. The `core.exportVariable` function uses a well known delimiter that
  attackers can use to break out of that specific variable and assign values to other
  arbitrary variables. Workflows that write untrusted values to the `GITHUB_ENV` file
  may cause the path or other environment variables to be modified without the intention
  of the workflow or action author. Users should upgrade to `@actions/core v1.9.1`.
  If you are unable to upgrade the `@actions/core` package, you can modify your action
  to ensure that any user input does not contain the delimiter `_GitHubActionsFileCommandDelimeter_`
  before calling `core.exportVariable`."
