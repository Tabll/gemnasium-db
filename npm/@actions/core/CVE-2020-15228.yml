package_slug: "npm/@actions/core"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "In the `@actions/core` npm module, `addPath` and `exportVariable` functions
  communicate with the Actions Runner over stdout by generating a string in a specific
  format. Workflows that log untrusted data to stdout may invoke these commands, resulting
  in the path or environment variables being modified without the intention of the
  workflow or action author. The runner will release an update that disables the `set-env`
  and `add-path` workflow commands in the near future."
