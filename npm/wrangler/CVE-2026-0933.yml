title: "Wrangler affected by OS Command Injection in `wrangler pages deploy`"
description: "**Summary**\n\nA command injection vulnerability (CWE-78) has been found
  to exist in the `wrangler pages deploy` command. The issue occurs because the `--commit-hash`
  parameter is passed directly to a shell command without proper validation or sanitization,
  allowing an attacker with control of `--commit-hash` to execute arbitrary commands
  on the system running Wrangler.\n\n**Root cause**\n\nThe `commitHash` variable,
  derived from user input via the `--commit-hash` CLI argument, is interpolated directly
  into a shell command using template literals (e.g., ``execSync(`git show -s --format=%B
  ${commitHash}`)``). Shell metacharacters are interpreted by the shell, enabling
  command execution.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThis vulnerability is generally hard to exploit,
  as it requires `--commit-hash` to be attacker controlled. The vulnerability primarily
  affects CI/CD environments where `wrangler pages deploy` is used in automated pipelines
  and the `--commit-hash` parameter is populated from external, potentially untrusted
  sources. An attacker could exploit this to:\n\n- Run any shell command.\n- Exfiltrate
  environment variables.\n- Compromise the CI runner to install backdoors or modify
  build artifacts.\n\n**Mitigation**\n\n- Wrangler v4 users are requested to upgrade
  to Wrangler v4.59.1 or higher.\n- Wrangler v3 users are requested to upgrade to
  Wrangler v3.114.17 or higher.\n- Users on Wrangler v2 (EOL) should upgrade to a
  supported major version.\n\n**Credits**\n\nDisclosed responsibly by kny4hacker."
