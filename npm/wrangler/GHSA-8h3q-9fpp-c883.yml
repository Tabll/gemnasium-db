title: "Duplicate Advisory: Wrangler affected by OS Command Injection in `wrangler
  pages deploy`"
description: "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-36p8-mvp6-cv38. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n## Original Description\n\nSummaryA command injection vulnerability
  (CWE-78) has been found to exist in the `wrangler pages deploy` command. The issue
  occurs because the `--commit-hash` parameter is passed directly to a shell command
  without proper validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker with control of
  `--commit-hash` to execute arbitrary commands on the system running Wrangler.\n\n\n\n\nRoot
  causeThe commitHash variable, derived from user input via the --commit-hash CLI
  argument, is interpolated directly into a shell command using template literals
  (e.g.,  execSync(`git show -s --format=%B ${commitHash}`)). Shell metacharacters
  are interpreted by the shell, enabling command execution.\n\n\n\n\nImpactThis vulnerability
  is generally hard to exploit, as it requires --commit-hash to be attacker controlled.
  The vulnerability primarily affects CI/CD environments where `wrangler pages deploy`
  is used in automated pipelines and the \n\n--commit-hash parameter is populated
  from external, potentially untrusted sources. An attacker could exploit this to:\n\n
  \ *  Run any shell command.\n  *  Exfiltrate environment variables.\n  *  Compromise
  the CI runner to install backdoors or modify build artifacts.\n\n\n\nCredits Disclosed
  responsibly by kny4hacker.\n\n\n\n\nMitigation\n  *  Wrangler v4 users are requested
  to upgrade to Wrangler v4.59.1 or higher.\n  *  Wrangler v3 users are requested
  to upgrade to Wrangler v3.114.17 or higher.\n  *  Users on Wrangler v2 (EOL) should
  upgrade to a supported major version."
