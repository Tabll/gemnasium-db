identifiers:
- "CVE-2021-23518"
package_slug: "npm/cached-path-relative"
title: "Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype
  Pollution')"
description: "The package cached-path-relative is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution
  via the cache variable that is set as {} instead of Object.create(null) in the cachedPathRelative
  function, which allows access to the parent prototype properties when the object
  is used to create the cached relative path. When using the origin path as __proto__,
  the attribute of the object is accessed instead of a path. **Note:** This vulnerability
  derives from an incomplete fix in https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-CACHEDPATHRELATIVE-72573"
