title: "Express.js Open Redirect in malformed URLs"
description: "Versions of Express.js prior to 4.19.2 and pre-release alpha and beta
  versions before 5.0.0-beta.3 are affected by an open redirect vulnerability using
  malformed URLs.\n\nWhen a user of Express performs a redirect using a user-provided
  URL Express performs an encode [using `encodeurl`](https://github.com/pillarjs/encodeurl)
  on the contents before passing it to the `location` header. This can cause malformed
  URLs to be evaluated in unexpected ways by common redirect allow list implementations
  in Express applications, leading to an Open Redirect via bypass of a properly implemented
  allow list.\n\nThe main method impacted is `res.location()` but this is also called
  from within `res.redirect()`."
