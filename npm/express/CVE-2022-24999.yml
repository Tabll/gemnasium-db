- "CVE-2022-24999"
package_slug: "npm/express"
title: "Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype
  Pollution')"
description: "qs before 6.10.3, as used in Express before 4.17.3 and other products,
  allows attackers to cause a Node process hang for an Express application because
  an __ proto__ key can be used. In many typical Express use cases, an unauthenticated
  remote attacker can place the attack payload in the query string of the URL that
  is used to visit the application, such as a[__proto__]=b&a[__proto__]&a[length]=100000000.
  The fix was backported to qs 6.9.7, 6.8.3, 6.7.3, 6.6.1, 6.5.3, 6.4.1, 6.3.3, and
  6.2.4 (and therefore Express 4.17.3, which has \"deps: qs@6.9.7\" in its release
  description, is not vulnerable)."
