title: "Babel vulnerable to arbitrary code execution when compiling specifically crafted
  malicious code"
description: "Using Babel to compile code that was specifically crafted by an attacker
  can lead to arbitrary code execution during compilation, when using plugins that
  rely on the `path.evaluate()`or `path.evaluateTruthy()` internal Babel methods.\n\nKnown
  affected plugins are:\n- `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime`\n- `@babel/preset-env`
  when using its [`useBuiltIns`](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-preset-env#usebuiltins)
  option\n- Any \"polyfill provider\" plugin that depends on `@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider`,
  such as `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs2`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-es-shims`,
  `babel-plugin-polyfill-regenerator`\n\nNo other plugins under the `@babel/` namespace
  are impacted, but third-party plugins might be.\n\n**Users that only compile trusted
  code are not impacted.**"
