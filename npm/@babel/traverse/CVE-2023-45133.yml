package_slug: "npm/@babel/traverse"
title: "Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs"
description: "Babel is a compiler for writingJavaScript. In `@babel/traverse` prior
  to versions 7.23.2 and 8.0.0-alpha.4 and all versions of `babel-traverse`, using
  Babel to compile code that was specifically crafted by an attacker can lead to arbitrary
  code execution during compilation, when using plugins that rely on the `path.evaluate()`or
  `path.evaluateTruthy()` internal Babel methods. Known affected plugins are `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime`;
  `@babel/preset-env` when using its `useBuiltIns` option; and any \"polyfill provider\"
  plugin that depends on `@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider`, such as `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3`,
  `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs2`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-es-shims`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-regenerator`.
  No other plugins under the `@babel/` namespace are impacted, but third-party plugins
  might be. Users that only compile trusted code are not impacted. The vulnerability
  has been fixed in `@babel/traverse@7.23.2` and `@babel/traverse@8.0.0-alpha.4`.
  Those who cannot upgrade `@babel/traverse` and are using one of the affected packages
  mentioned above should upgrade them to their latest version to avoid triggering
  the vulnerable code path in affected `@babel/traverse` versions: `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime`
  v7.23.2, `@babel/preset-env` v7.23.2, `@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider` v0.4.3,
  `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs2` v0.4.6, `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3` v0.8.5,
  `babel-plugin-polyfill-es-shims` v0.10.0, `babel-plugin-polyfill-regenerator` v0.5.3."
