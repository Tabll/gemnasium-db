title: "Babel has inefficient RexExp complexity in generated code with .replace when
  transpiling named capturing groups"
description: "When using Babel to compile [regular expression named capturing groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group),
  Babel will generate a polyfill for the `.replace` method that has quadratic complexity
  on some specific replacement pattern strings (i.e. the second argument passed to
  `.replace`).\n\nYour generated code is vulnerable if _all_ the following conditions
  are true:\n- You use Babel to compile [regular expression named capturing groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group)
  or\n- You use the `.replace` method on a regular expression that contains named
  capturing groups\n- **Your code uses untrusted strings as the second argument of
  `.replace`**\n\nIf you are using `@babel/preset-env` with the [`targets`](https://babeljs.io/docs/options#targets)
  option, the transform that injects the vulnerable code is automatically enabled
  if:\n- you use [_duplicated_ named capturing groups](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-duplicate-named-capturing-groups),
  and target any browser older than Chrome/Edge 126, Opera 112, Firefox 129, Safari
  17.4, or Node.js 23\n- you use any [named capturing groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group),
  and target any browser older than Chrome 64, Opera 71, Edge 79, Firefox 78, Safari
  11.1, or Node.js 10\n\nYou can verify what transforms `@babel/preset-env` is using
  by enabling the [`debug` option](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-preset-env#debug)."
