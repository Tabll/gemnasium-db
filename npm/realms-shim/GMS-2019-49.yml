title: "Sandbox Breakout in realms-shim"
description: "Versions of `realms-shim` are vulnerable to a Sandbox Breakout. The
  Realms evaluation function has an option to apply Babel-like transformations to
  the source code before it reaches the evaluator. One portion of this transform pipeline
  exposed a primal-Realm object to the rewriting function. Confined code which used
  the evaluator itself could provide a malicious rewriter function that captured this
  object, and use it to breach the sandbox. Upgrade to or later."
