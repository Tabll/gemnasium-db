title: "Taylor has race condition in /get-patch that allows purchase token replay"
description: "The /get-patch endpoint processes a purchase in two separate database
  queries: a SELECT that verifies the token is unused, followed by an UPDATE that
  marks the token as used. Because SQLite only guards each statement, a malicious
  actor can issue two requests at the exact same moment and have both SELECT statements
  succeed before either UPDATE runs."
