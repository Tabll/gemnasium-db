title: "Taylored webhook validation vulnerabilities"
description: "A series of moderate to high-severity security vulnerabilities have
  been identified specifically in version **7.0.7 of \\`taylored\\`**. These vulnerabilities
  reside in the \"Backend-in-a-Box\" template distributed with this version. They
  could allow a malicious actor to read arbitrary files from the server, download
  paid patches without completing a valid purchase, and weaken the protection of encrypted
  patches.\n\n**All users who have installed or generated a \\`taysell-server\\` using
  version 7.0.7 of \\`taylored\\` are strongly advised to immediately upgrade to version
  7.0.8 (or later) and follow the required mitigation steps outlined below.** Versions
  prior to 7.0.7 did not include the Taysell functionality and are therefore not affected
  by these specific issues."
