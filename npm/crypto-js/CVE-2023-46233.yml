title: "crypto-js PBKDF2 1,000 times weaker than specified in 1993 and 1.3M times
  weaker than current standard"
description: "crypto-js is a JavaScript library of crypto standards. Prior to version
  4.2.0, crypto-js PBKDF2 is 1,000 times weaker than originally specified in 1993,
  and at least 1,300,000 times weaker than current industry standard. This is because
  it both defaults to SHA1, a cryptographic hash algorithm considered insecure since
  at least 2005, and defaults to one single iteration, a 'strength' or 'difficulty'
  value specified at 1,000 when specified in 1993. PBKDF2 relies on iteration count
  as a countermeasure to preimage and collision attacks. If used to protect passwords,
  the impact is high. If used to generate signatures, the impact is high. Version
  4.2.0 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, configure crypto-js to use
  SHA256 with at least 250,000 iterations."
