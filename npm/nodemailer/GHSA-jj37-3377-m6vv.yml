title: "Duplicate Advisory: Nodemailer: Email to an unintended domain can occur due
  to Interpretation Conflict"
description: "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-mm7p-fcc7-pg87. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n## Original Description\nA vulnerability was identified in the email
  parsing library due to improper handling of specially formatted recipient email
  addresses. An attacker can exploit this flaw by crafting a recipient address that
  embeds an external address within quotes. This causes the application to misdirect
  the email to the attacker's external address instead of the intended internal recipient.
  This could lead to a significant data leak of sensitive information and allow an
  attacker to bypass security filters and access controls."
