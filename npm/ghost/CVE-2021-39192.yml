package_slug: "npm/ghost"
title: "Improper Privilege Management"
description: "Ghost is a Node.js content management system. An error in the implementation
  of the limits service allows all authenticated users (including contributors) to
  view admin-level API keys via the integrations API endpoint, leading to a privilege
  escalation vulnerability. As a workaround, disable all non-Administrator accounts
  to prevent API access. It is highly recommended to regenerate all API keys after
  patching or applying the workaround."
