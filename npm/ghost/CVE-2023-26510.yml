title: "Missing Authorization"
description: "Ghost 5.35.0 allows authorization bypass: contributors can view draft
  posts of other users, which is arguably inconsistent with a security policy in which
  a contributor's draft can only be read by editors until published by an editor.
  NOTE: the vendor's position is that this behavior has no security impact."
