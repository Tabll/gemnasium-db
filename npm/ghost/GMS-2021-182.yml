title: "Remote command injection when using sendmail email transport"
description: "### Impact\n\nSites using the `sendmail` transport as part of their
  `mail` config are vulnerable to remote command injection due to a [vulnerability](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-48ww-j4fc-435p)
  in the `nodemailer` dependency.\n\nGhost defaults to the `direct` transport so this
  is only exploitable if the `sendmail` transport is explicitly used.\n\n### Patches\n\nFixed
  in 4.15.0, all sites should upgrade as soon as possible.\n\n### Workarounds\n\n*
  Use an alternative email transport as described in the [docs](https://ghost.org/docs/config/#mail).
  \n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this
  advisory:\n\n* email us at security@ghost.org\n"
