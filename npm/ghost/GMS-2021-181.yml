title: "Member account takeover"
description: "### Impact\n\nAn error in the implementation of the member email change
  functionality allows unauthenticated users to change the email address of arbitrary
  member accounts to one they control by crafting a request to the relevant API endpoint,
  and validating the new address via magic link sent to the new email address.\n\nGhost(Pro)
  has already been patched. Self-hosters are impacted if running Ghost a version between
  3.18.0 and 4.15.0 with members functionality enabled.\n\n### Patches\n\nFixed in
  4.15.1, all 4.x sites should upgrade as soon as possible.\nFixed in 3.42.6, all
  3.x sites should upgrade as soon as possible.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe patch in
  4.15.1 and 3.42.6 adds a new authenticated endpoint for updating member email addresses.
  Updating Ghost is the quickest complete solution.\n\nAs a workaround, if for any
  reason you cannot update your Ghost instance, you can block the `POST /members/api/send-magic-link/`
  endpoint, which will also disable member login and signup for your site.\n\n###
