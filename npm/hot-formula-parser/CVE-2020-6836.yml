package_slug: "npm/hot-formula-parser"
title: "Code Injection"
description: "`grammar-parser.jison` in the hot-formula-parser package for Node.js
  is vulnerable to arbitrary code injection. The package fails to sanitize values
  passed to the parse function and concatenates them in an eval call. If a value of
  the formula is taken from user-controlled input, it may allow attackers to run arbitrary
  commands on the server."
