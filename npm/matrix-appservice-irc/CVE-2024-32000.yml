title: "Matrix IRC Bridge truncated content of messages can be leaked"
description: "The matrix-appservice-irc before version 2.0.0 can be exploited to leak
  the truncated body of a message if a malicious user sends a Matrix reply to an event
  ID they don't have access to. As a precondition to the attack, the malicious user
  needs to know the event ID of the message they want to leak, as well as to be joined
  to both the Matrix room and the IRC channel it is bridged to.\n\nThe message reply
  containing the leaked message content is visible to IRC channel members when this
  happens."
