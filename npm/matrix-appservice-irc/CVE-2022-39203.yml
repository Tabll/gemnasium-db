package_slug: "npm/matrix-appservice-irc"
title: "Improper Privilege Management"
description: "matrix-appservice-irc is an open source Node.js IRC bridge for Matrix.
  Attackers can specify a specific string of characters, which would confuse the bridge
  into combining an attacker-owned channel and an existing channel, allowing them
  to grant themselves permissions in the channel. The vulnerability has been patched
  in matrix-appservice-irc 0.35.0. As a workaround operators may disable dynamic channel
  joining via `dynamicChannels.enabled` to prevent users from joining new channels,
  which prevents any new channels being bridged outside of what is already bridged,
  and what is specified in the config."
