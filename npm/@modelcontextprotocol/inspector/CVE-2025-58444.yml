title: "MCP Inspector is Vulnerable to Potential Command Execution via XSS When Connecting
  to an Untrusted MCP Server"
description: "An XSS flaw exists in the MCP Inspector local development tool when
  it renders a redirect URL returned by a remote MCP server. If the Inspector connects
  to an untrusted server, a crafted redirect can inject script into the Inspector
  context and, via the built-in proxy, be leveraged to trigger arbitrary command execution
  on the developer machine. Version 0.16.6 hardens URL handling/validation and prevents
  script execution.\n\n> Thank you to the following researchers for their reports
  and contributions:\n> * Raymond (Veria Labs)\n> * Gavin Zhong, <superboyzjc@gmail.com>
  & Shuyang Wang, <swang@obsidiansecurity.com>."
