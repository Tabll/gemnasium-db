title: "Anthropic's MCP TypeScript SDK has a ReDoS vulnerability"
description: "Anthropic's MCP TypeScript SDK versions up to and including 1.25.1 contain
  a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability in the UriTemplate
  class when processing RFC 6570 exploded array patterns. The dynamically generated
  regular expression used during URI matching contains nested quantifiers that can
  trigger catastrophic backtracking on specially crafted inputs, resulting in excessive
  CPU consumption. An attacker can exploit this by supplying a malicious URI that
  causes the Node.js process to become unresponsive, leading to a denial of service."
