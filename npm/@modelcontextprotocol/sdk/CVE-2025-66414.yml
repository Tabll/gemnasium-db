title: "Model Context Protocol (MCP) TypeScript SDK does not enable DNS rebinding
  protection by default"
description: "The Model Context Protocol (MCP) TypeScript SDK does not enable DNS
  rebinding protection by default for HTTP-based servers. When an HTTP-based MCP server
  is run on localhost without authentication with `StreamableHTTPServerTransport`
  or `SSEServerTransport` and has not enabled `enableDnsRebindingProtection`, a malicious
  website could exploit DNS rebinding to bypass same-origin policy restrictions and
  send requests to the local MCP server. This could allow an attacker to invoke tools
  or access resources exposed by the MCP server on behalf of the user in those limited
  circumstances.\n\nNote that running HTTP-based MCP servers locally without authentication
  is not recommended per MCP security best practices. This issue does not affect servers
  using stdio transport.\n\nServers created via `createMcpExpressApp()` now have this
  protection enabled by default when binding to localhost. Users with custom Express
  configurations are advised to update to version `1.24.0` and apply the exported
  `hostHeaderValidation()` middleware when running an unauthenticated server on localhost."
