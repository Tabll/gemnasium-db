identifier: "CVE-2024-47764"
identifiers:
- "CVE-2024-47764"
- "GHSA-pxg6-pf52-xh8x"
package_slug: "npm/cookie"
title: "cookie accepts cookie name, path, and domain with out of bounds characters"
description: "The cookie name could be used to set other fields of the cookie, resulting
  in an unexpected cookie value. For example, `serialize(\"userName=<script>alert('XSS3')</script>;
  Max-Age=2592000; a\", value)` would result in `\"userName=<script>alert('XSS3')</script>;
  Max-Age=2592000; a=test\"`, setting `userName` cookie to `<script>` and ignoring
  `value`.\n\nA similar escape can be used for `path` and `domain`, which could be
  abused to alter other fields of the cookie."
