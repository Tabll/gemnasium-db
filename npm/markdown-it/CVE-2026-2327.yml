title: "markdown-it is has a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)"
description: "Versions of the package markdown-it from 13.0.0 and before 14.1.1 are
  vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to the use of the
  regex /\\*+$/ in the linkify function. An attacker can supply a long sequence of
  * characters followed by a non-matching character, which triggers excessive backtracking
  and may lead to a denial-of-service condition."
