title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "matrix-react-sdk is a react-based SDK for inserting a Matrix chat/voip
  client into a web page. The Export Chat feature includes certain attacker-controlled
  elements in the generated document without sufficient escaping, leading to stored
  Cross site scripting (XSS). Since the Export Chat feature generates a separate document,
  an attacker can only inject code run from the `null` origin, restricting the impact.
  However, the attacker can still potentially use the XSS to leak message contents.
  A malicious homeserver is a potential attacker since the affected inputs are controllable
  server-side. This issue has been addressed in commit `22fcd34c60` which is included
  in release version 3.76.0. Users are advised to upgrade. The only known workaround
  for this issue is to disable or to not use the Export Chat feature."
