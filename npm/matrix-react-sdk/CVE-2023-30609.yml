title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream
  Component ('Injection')"
description: "matrix-react-sdk is a react-based SDK for inserting a Matrix chat/VoIP
  client into a web page. Prior to version 3.71.0, plain text messages containing
  HTML tags are rendered as HTML in the search results. To exploit this, an attacker
  needs to trick a user into searching for a specific message containing an HTML injection
  payload. No cross-site scripting attack is possible due to the hardcoded content
  security policy. Version 3.71.0 of the SDK patches over the issue. As a workaround,
  restarting the client will clear the HTML injection."
