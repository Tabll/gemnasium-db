title: "Malicious homeservers can steal message keys when the matrix-react-sdk user

description: "matrix-react-sdk before 3.102.0 allows a malicious homeserver to potentially
  steal message keys for a room when a user invites another user to that room, via
  injection of a malicious device controlled by the homeserver. This is possible because
  matrix-react-sdk before 3.102.0 shared historical message keys on invite."
