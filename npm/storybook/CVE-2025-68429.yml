package_slug: "npm/storybook"
title: "Storybook manager bundle may expose environment variables during build"
description: "On December 11th, the Storybook team received a responsible disclosure
  alerting them to a potential vulnerability in certain built and published Storybooks.\n\nThe
  vulnerability is a bug in how Storybook handles environment variables defined in
  a `.env` file, which could, in specific circumstances, lead to those variables being
  unexpectedly bundled into the artifacts created by the `storybook build` command.
  When a built Storybook is published to the web, the bundle’s source is viewable,
  thus potentially exposing those variables to anyone with access. If those variables
  contained secrets, they should be considered compromised."
