package_slug: "npm/execa"
title: "Uncontrolled Search Path Element"
description: "Attackers could trick execa into executing arbitrary binaries. This
  behaviour is caused by the setting `preferLocal=true` which makes execa search
  for locally installed binaries and executes them. This vulnerability is usually only 
  exploitable when using execa on a client-side LOCAL application."
