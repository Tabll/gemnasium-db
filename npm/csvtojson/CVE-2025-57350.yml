title: "CSVTOJSON has a prototype pollution vulnerability"
description: "The csvtojson package, a tool for converting CSV data to JSON with customizable
  parsing capabilities, contains a prototype pollution vulnerability in versions prior
  to 2.0.10. This issue arises due to insufficient sanitization of nested header names
  during the parsing process in the parser_jsonarray component. When processing CSV
  input containing specially crafted header fields that reference prototype chains
  (e.g., using __proto__ syntax), the application may unintentionally modify properties
  of the base Object prototype. This vulnerability can lead to denial of service conditions
  or unexpected behavior in applications relying on unmodified prototype chains, particularly
  when untrusted CSV data is processed. The flaw does not require user interaction
  beyond providing a maliciously constructed CSV file."
