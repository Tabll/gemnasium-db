package_slug: "npm/remult"
title: "Improper Access Control"
description: "Remult is a CRUD framework for full-stack TypeScript. If you used the
  apiPrefilter option of the `@Entity` decorator, by setting it to a function that
  returns a filter that prevents unauthorized access to data, an attacker who knows
  the `id` of an entity instance is not authorized to access, can gain read, update
  and delete access to it. The issue is fixed in version 0.20.6. As a workaround,
  set the `apiPrefilter` option to a filter object instead of a function."
