package_slug: "npm/product-monitor"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command
  Injection')"
description: "product-monitor is a HTML/JavaScript template for monitoring a product
  by encouraging product developers to gather all the information about the status
  of a product, including live monitoring, statistics, endpoints, and test results
  into one place. product-monitor versions below 2.2.5 download JavaScript resources
  over HTTP, which leaves the module vulnerable to MITM attacks. It may be possible
  to cause remote code execution (RCE) by swapping out the requested JavaScript file
  with an attacker controlled JavaScript file if the attacker is on the network or
  positioned in between the user and the remote server."
