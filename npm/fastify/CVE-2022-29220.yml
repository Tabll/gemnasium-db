title: "Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity"
description: "github-action-merge-dependabot is an action that automatically approves
  and merges dependabot pull requests (PRs). Prior to version 3.2.0, github-action-merge-dependabot
  does not check if a commit created by dependabot is verified with the proper GPG
  key. There is just a check if the actor is set to `dependabot[bot]` to determine
  if the PR is a legit PR. Theoretically, an owner of a seemingly valid and legit
  action in the pipeline can check if the PR is created by dependabot and if their
  own action has enough permissions to modify the PR in the pipeline. If so, they
  can modify the PR by adding a second seemingly valid and legit commit to the PR,
  as they can set arbitrarily the username and email in for commits in git. Because
  the bot only checks if the actor is valid, it would pass the malicious changes through
  and merge the PR automatically, without getting noticed by project maintainers.
  It would probably not be possible to determine where the malicious commit came from,
  as it would only say `dependabot[bot]` and the corresponding email-address. Version
  3.2.0 contains a patch for this issue."
