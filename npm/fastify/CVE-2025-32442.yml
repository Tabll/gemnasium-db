title: "Fasify vulnerable to invalid content-type parsing, which could lead to validation
  bypass"
description: "In applications that specify different validation strategies for different
  content types, it's possible to bypass the validation by providing a _slightly altered_
  content type such as with different casing or altered whitespacing before `;`.\n\nUsers
  using the the following pattern are affected:\n\n```js\nfastify.post('/', {\nhandler(request,
  reply) {\nreply.code(200).send(request.body)\n},\nschema: {\nbody: {\ncontent: {\n'application/json':
  {\nschema: {\ntype: 'object',\nproperties: {\n'foo': {\ntype: 'string',\n}\n},\nrequired:
  ['foo']\n}\n},\n}\n}\n}\n})\n```\n\nUser using the following pattern are **not**
  affected:\n\n```js\nfastify.post('/', {\nhandler(request, reply) {\nreply.code(200).send(request.body)\n},\nschema:
  {\nbody: {\ntype: 'object',\nproperties: {\n'foo': {\ntype: 'string',\n}\n},\nrequired:
  ['foo']\n}\n}\n})\n```"
