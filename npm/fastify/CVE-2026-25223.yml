title: "Fastify's Content-Type header tab character allows body validation bypass"
description: "A validation bypass vulnerability exists in Fastify where request body
  validation schemas specified by Content-Type can be completely circumvented. By
  appending a tab character (`\\t`) followed by arbitrary content to the Content-Type
  header, attackers can bypass body validation while the server still processes the
  body as the original content type.\n\nFor example, a request with `Content-Type:
  application/json\\ta` will bypass JSON schema validation but still be parsed as
  JSON.\n\nThis vulnerability affects all Fastify users who rely on Content-Type-based
  body validation schemas to enforce data integrity or security constraints. The concrete
  impact depends on the handler implementation and the level of trust placed in the
  validated request body, but at the library level, this allows complete bypass of
  body validation for any handler using Content-Type-discriminated schemas.\n\nThis
  issue is a regression or missed edge case from the fix for a previously reported
  vulnerability."
