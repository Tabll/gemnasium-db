package_slug: "npm/@node-saml/node-saml"
title: "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature"
description: "Passport-SAML is a SAML 2.0 authentication provider for Passport, the
  Node.js authentication library. A remote attacker may be able to bypass SAML authentication
  on a website using passport-saml. A successful attack requires that the attacker
  is in possession of an arbitrary IDP signed XML element. Depending on the IDP used,
  fully unauthenticated attacks (e.g without access to a valid user) might also be
  feasible if generation of a signed message can be triggered. Users should upgrade
  to passport-saml version 3.2.2 or newer. The issue was also present in the beta
  releases of `node-saml` before version 4.0.0-beta.5. If you cannot upgrade, disabling
  SAML authentication may be done as a workaround."
