title: "React Developer Tools extension Improper Authorization vulnerability"
description: "The React Developer Tools extension registers a message listener with
  window.addEventListener('message', <listener>) in a content script that is accessible
  to any webpage that is active in the browser. Within the listener is code that requests
  a URL derived from the received message via fetch(). The URL is not validated or
  sanitised before it is fetched, thus allowing a malicious web page to arbitrarily
  fetch URLâ€™s via the victim's browser."
