title: "follow-redirects' Proxy-Authorization header kept across hosts"
description: "When using axios, its dependency library follow-redirects only clears
  authorization header during cross-domain redirect, but allows the proxy-authentication
  header which contains credentials too.\n\nSteps To Reproduce & PoC\n\naxios Test
  Code\n\nconst axios = require('axios');\n\naxios.get('http://127.0.0.1:10081/',{\n
  \   headers: {\n        'AuThorization': 'Rear Test',\n        'ProXy-AuthoriZation':
  'Rear Test',\n        'coOkie': 't=1'\n    }\n    }).then(function (response) {\n
  \       console.log(response);\n})\nWhen I meet the cross-domain redirect, the sensitive
  headers like authorization and cookie are cleared, but proxy-authentication header
  is kept.\n\nRequest sent by axios\n\nimage-20240314130755052.png\nRequest sent by
