package_slug: "npm/webpack-subresource-integrity"
title: "Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity"
description: "In webpack-subresource-integrity, all dynamically loaded chunks receive
  an invalid integrity hash that is ignored by the browser, and therefore the browser
  cannot validate their integrity. This removes the additional level of protection
  offered by SRI for such chunks. Top-level chunks are unaffected."
