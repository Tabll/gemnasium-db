title: "FUXA Affected by a Path Traversal Sanitization Bypass"
description: "A flaw in the path sanitization logic allows an authenticated attacker
  with administrative privileges to bypass directory traversal protections. By using
  nested traversal sequences (e.g., ....//), an attacker can write arbitrary files
  to the server filesystem, including sensitive directories like runtime/scripts.
  This leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE) when the server reloads the malicious
  scripts. It is a new vulnerability a patch bypass for the sanitization in the last
  release ."
