title: "Sandbox Breakout / Arbitrary Code Execution in localeval"
description: "All versions of `localeval` are vulnerable to Sandbox Escape leading
  to Remote Code Execution. The package fails to restrict access to the main context
  through `constructor.constructor`. This may allow attackers to execute arbitrary
  code in the system.  Evaluating the payload\n```\nconstructor.constructor(\"return
  process.env\")()\n```\n\nreturns the contents of `process.env`."
