title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')"
description: "The package git-pull-or-clone before 2.0.2 is vulnerable to Command
  Injection due to the use of the --upload-pack feature of git which is also supported
  for git clone. The source includes the use of the secure child process API spawn().
  However, the outpath parameter passed to it may be a command-line argument to the
  git clone command and result in arbitrary command injection."
