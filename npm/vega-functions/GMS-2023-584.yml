package_slug: "npm/vega-functions"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "Vega is a visualization grammar, a declarative format for creating,
  saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs.`lassoAppend' function accepts
  3 arguments and internally invokes `push` function on the 1st argument specifying
  array consisting of 2nd and 3rd arguments as `push` call argument. The type of the
  1st argument is supposed to be an array, but it's not enforced. This makes it possible
  to specify any object with a `push` function as the 1st argument, `push` function
  can be set to any function that can be access via `event.view` (no all such functions
  can be exploited due to invalid context or signature, but some can, e.g. `console.log`).
  The issue is that`lassoAppend` does not enforce proper types of its arguments. This
  issue opens various XSS vectors, but exact impact and severity depends on the environment
  (e.g. Core JS `setImmediate` polyfill basically allows `eval`-like functionality).
  This issue was patched in 5.23.0."
