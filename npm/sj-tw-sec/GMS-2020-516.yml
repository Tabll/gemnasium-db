title: "Malicious Package"
description: "All versions of `sj-tw-sec` contain malicious code. The package downloads
  and runs a script that opens a reverse shell in the system. Any computer that has
  this package installed or running should be considered fully compromised. All secrets
  and keys stored on that computer should be rotated immediately from a different
  computer.\n\nThe package should be removed, but as full control of the computer
  may have been given to an outside entity, there is no guarantee that removing the
  package will remove all malicious software resulting from installing it."
