title: "AWS SDK for JavaScript v3 adopted defense in depth enhancement for region
  parameter value"
description: "CVSSv3.1 Rating: 3.7 (LOW)\n\nSummary\n\nThis notification is related
  to the use of specific values for the region input field when calling AWS services.
  An actor with access to the environment in which the SDK is used could set the region
  input field to an invalid value.\n\nA defense-in-depth enhancement has been implemented
  in the AWS SDK for JavaScript v3 (versions 3.723.0 and later). This enhancement
  validates that a region used to construct an endpoint URL is a valid host label.
  The change was released on November 15, 2025. This advisory is informational to
  help customers understand their responsibilities regarding configuration security.\n\nImpact\nCustomer
  applications could be configured to improperly route AWS API calls to non-existent
  or non-AWS hosts. While the SDK was functioning as designed, additional safeguards
  have been added to support secure customer implementations.\n\nImpacted versions:
  @smithy/config-resolver <4.4.0\n\nPatches\n\nOn November 15, 2025, an enhancement
  was made to the AWS SDK for JavaScript v3 (versions 3.723.0 and later) release,
  which validates the formatting of a region, providing additional safeguards. A feature
  enhancement was implemented in @smithy/config-resolver v4.4.0. This enhancement
  provides additional configuration validation safeguards but does not address a security
  vulnerability.\n\nWorkarounds\nNo workarounds are needed, but as always you should
  ensure that your application is following security best practices:\n- Implement
  proper input validation in your application code\n- Update to the latest AWS SDK
  for Javascript v3 release on a regular basis\n- Follow AWS security best practices
  [1] for SDK configuration\n\nResources\nContact AWS Security via the vulnerability
  reporting page or email [aws-security@amazon.com](mailto:aws-security@amazon.com).\n\nAcknowledgement\nAWS
  Security thanks Guy Arazi for bringing these customer security considerations to
  our attention through the coordinated disclosure process.\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/security.html"
