title: "binary-parser library has a code injection vulnerability"
description: "A code injection vulnerability in the binary-parser library prior to

  used in parser field names or encoding parameters. The library directly interpolates
  these values into dynamically generated code without sanitization, enabling attackers
  to execute arbitrary code in the context of the Node.js process."
