package_slug: "npm/open-webui"
title: "Open WebUI Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability"
description: "In version 0.3.32 of open-webui/open-webui, the absence of authentication
  mechanisms allows any unauthenticated attacker to access the `api/v1/utils/code/format`
  endpoint. If a malicious actor sends a POST request with an excessively high volume
  of content, the server could become completely unresponsive. This could lead to
  severe performance issues, causing the server to become unresponsive or experience
  significant degradation, ultimately resulting in service interruptions for legitimate
  users."
