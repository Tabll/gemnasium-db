title: "Open WebUI Affected by an External Model Server (Direct Connections) Code
  Injection via SSE Events"
description: "Open WebUI v0.6.33 and below contains a code injection vulnerability
  in the Direct Connections feature that allows malicious external model servers to
  execute arbitrary JavaScript in victim browsers via Server-Sent Event (SSE) `execute`
  events. This leads to authentication token theft, complete account takeover, and
  when chained with the Functions API, enables remote code execution on the backend
  server. The attack requires the victim to enable Direct Connections (disabled by
  default) and add the attacker's malicious model URL, achievable through social engineering
  of the admin and subsequent users."
