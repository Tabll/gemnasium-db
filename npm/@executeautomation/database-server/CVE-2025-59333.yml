title: "@executeautomation/database-server does not properly restrict access, bypassing
  a \"read-only\" mode"
description: "The MCP Server provided by ExecuteAutomation at https://github.com/executeautomation/mcp-database-server
  provides an MCP interface for agentic workflows to interact with different kinds
  of database servers such as PostgreSQL database. However, the `mcp-database-server`
  MCP Server distributed via the npm package `@executeautomation/database-server`
  fails to implement proper security control that properly enforce a \"read-only\"
  mode and as such it is vulnerable to abuse and attacks on the affected database
  servers such as PostgreSQL (and potentially other db servers that expose elevated
  functionalities) and which may result in denial of service and other unexpected
  behavior.\n\nThis MCP Server is also publicly published in the npm registry: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@executeautomation/database-server"
