package_slug: "npm/uws"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "uws is a WebSocket server library. By sending a 256mb websocket message
  to a uws server instance with permessage-deflate enabled, there is a possibility
  used compression will shrink said 256mb down to less than 16mb of websocket payload
  which passes the length check of 16mb payload. This data will then inflate up to
  256mb and crash the node process by exceeding V8's maximum string size. This affects
  uws >=0.10.0 <=0.10.8."
