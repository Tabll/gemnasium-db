title: "AngularJS Incomplete Filtering of Special Elements vulnerability"
description: "Improper sanitization of the value of the 'href' and 'xlink:href' attributes
  in '<image>' SVG elements in AngularJS's 'ngSanitize' module allows attackers to
  bypass common image source restrictions. This can lead to a form of  Content Spoofing
  https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Content_Spoofing  and also negatively affect
  the application's performance and behavior by using too large or slow-to-load images.\n\nThis
  issue affects AngularJS versions greater than or equal to 1.3.1.\n\nNote:\nThe AngularJS
  project is End-of-Life and will not receive any updates to address this issue. For
