title: "Unintended Require in larvitbase-www"
description: "All versions of `larvitbase-www` are vulnerable to an Unintended Require.
  The package exposes an API endpoint and passes a GET parameter unsanitized to an
  `require()` call. This allows attackers to execute any `.js` file in the same folder
  as the server is running. No fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative
  package until a fix is made available."
