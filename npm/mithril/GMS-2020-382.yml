title: "Prototype Pollution in mithril"
description: "Affected versions of `mithril`are vulnerable to prototype pollution.
  The function `parseQueryString` may allow a malicious user to modify the prototype
  of `Object`, causing the addition or modification of an existing property that will
  exist on all objects. A payload such as `__proto__%5BtoString%5D=123` in the query
  string would change the `toString()` function to `123`. \nIf you are using mithril,
  upgrade to or later.\nIf you are using mithril, upgrade to or later."
