title: "Observable Discrepancy"
description: "@fastify/bearer-auth is a Fastify plugin to require bearer Authorization
  headers. @fastify/bearer-auth prior to versions 7.0.2 and 8.0.1 does not securely
  use crypto.timingSafeEqual. A malicious attacker could estimate the length of one
  valid bearer token. According to the corresponding RFC 6750, the bearer token has
  only base64 valid characters, reducing the range of characters for a brute force
  attack. Version 7.0.2 and 8.0.1 of @fastify/bearer-auth contain a patch. There are
  currently no known workarounds. The package fastify-bearer-auth, which covers versions
  6.0.3 and prior, is also vulnerable starting at version 5.0.1. Users of fastify-bearer-auth
  should upgrade to a patched version of @fastify/bearer-auth."
