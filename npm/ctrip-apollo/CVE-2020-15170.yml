package_slug: "npm/ctrip-apollo"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "apollo-adminservice does not implement access controls. If users expose
  apollo-adminservice to internet(which is not recommended), there are potential security
  issues since apollo-adminservice is designed to work in intranet and it does not
  have access control built-in. Malicious hackers may access apollo-adminservice apis
  directly to `access/edit` the application's configurations. To fix the potential
  issue without upgrading, simply follow the advice that do not expose apollo-adminservice
  to internet."
