title: "MetaMask SDK indirectly exposed via malicious debug@4.4.2 dependency"
description: "### Who is affected?\nThis advisory only applies to developers who use
  MetaMask SDK in the browser and who, on Sept 8th 2025 between 13:00–15:30 UTC, performed
  one of the following actions and then deployed their application:\n- Installed MetaMask
  SDK into a project with a lockfile for the first time\n- Installed MetaMask SDK
  in a project without a lockfile\n- Updated a lockfile to pull in `debug@4.4.2` (e.g.,
  via `npm update` or `yarn upgrade`)\n\n### What happened?\nOn Sept 8th, 2025 (13:00–15:30
  UTC), a malicious version of the `debug` package (v4.4.2) was published to npm.
  The injected code attempts to interfere with dApp-to-wallet communication when executed
  in a browser context. \n\nWhile MetaMask SDK itself was not directly impacted, projects
  installing the SDK during this window may have inadvertently pulled in the malicious
  version of `debug`.\n\n### Mitigation\n- If your application was rebuilt and redeployed
  after Sept 8th, 2025, 15:30 UTC, the malicious version of debug should no longer
  be present. Please also verify that your package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm, etc.)
  is not caching `debug@4.4.2`.\n- If you have not yet deployed since performing one
  of the actions above, delete your `node_modules` and reinstall dependencies before
  deploying.\n- If your application was deployed during the attack window and has
  not been rebuilt since, perform a clean install of dependencies and redeploy to
  ensure the malicious package is removed.\n\n### Resources\n[GitHub Advisory for
