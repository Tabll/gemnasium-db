title: "Incorrect Account Used for Signing"
description: "### Impact\n\nAnybody using this library to sign with a BIP44 account
  other than the first account may be affected. If a user is signing with the first
  account (i.e. the account at index `0`), or with the legacy MEW/MyCrypto HD path,
  they are not affected.\n\nThe vulnerability impacts cases where the user signs a
  personal message or transaction without first adding the account. This includes
  cases where the user has already added the account in a previous session (i.e. they
  added the account, reset the application, then signed something). The serialization/deserialization
  process does restore a previously added account, but it doesn&#39;t restore the
  index instructing the keyring to use that account for signing. As a result, after
  serializing then deserializing the keyring state, the account at index `0` is always
  used for signing even if it isn&#39;t the current account.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis
  has been patched ([#14](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-ledger-bridge-keyring/pull/14))
  in version &gt;=0.2.1 of [`eth-ledger-bridge-keyring`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eth-ledger-bridge-keyring),
  and in version &gt;=0.2.2 of [`@metamask/eth-ledger-bridge-keyring`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@metamask/eth-ledger-bridge-keyring).
  Users are encouraged to migrate to the new package name.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nTo
  work around this problem without updating, you should remove then re-add the account
  before use. As long as the account was added during the lifetime of that process,
  signing with that account should work correctly.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf
