description: "express-hbs is an Express handlebars template engine. express-hbs mixes
  pure template data with engine configuration options through the Express render

  in downstream applications. This potential vulnerability is somewhat restricted
  in that only files with existing extentions (i.e. file.extension) can be included,
  files that lack an extension will have .hbs appended to them."
