description: "Versions of `ecstatic` prior to 4.1.2, 3.3.2 or 2.2.2 are vulnerable
  to Open Redirect. The package fails to validate redirects, allowing attackers to
  craft requests that result in an `HTTP 301` redirect to any other domains.\n\n\n##
  Recommendation\n\nIf using `ecstatic` 4.x, upgrade to 4.1.2 or later.\nIf using
  `ecstatic` 3.x, upgrade to 3.3.2 or later.\nIf using `ecstatic` 2.x, upgrade to
  2.2.2 or later."
