package_slug: "npm/convict"
title: "Prototype Pollution in convict"
description: "An attacker can inject attributes that are used in other components
  and override existing attributes with ones that have incompatible type, which may
  lead to a crash.\n\nThe main use case of Convict is for handling server-side configurations
  written by the admins owning the servers, and not random users. So it's unlikely
  that an admin would deliberately sabotage their own server. Still a situation can
  happen where an admin not knowledgeable about JavaScript could be tricked by an
  attacker into writing the malicious JavaScript code into some config files.\n\nThe
  problem is patched in `convict@6.2.2`. Users should upgrade to `convict@6.2.2`.
  There is no way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading."
