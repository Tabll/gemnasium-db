  Pollution')"
description: "This affects the package convict before 6.2.3. This is a bypass of CVE-2022-22143
  introduced, relies on the startsWith method and does not prevent the vulnerability:
  before splitting the path, it checks if it starts with __proto__ or this.constructor.prototype.
  To bypass this check it's possible to prepend the dangerous paths with any string
  value followed by a dot, like for example foo.__proto__ or foo.this.constructor.prototype."
