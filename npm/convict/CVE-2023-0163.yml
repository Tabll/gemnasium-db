package_slug: "npm/convict"
title: "convict vulnerable to Prototype Pollution"
description: "* An attacker can inject attributes that are used in other components\n*
  An attacker can override existing attributes with ones that have incompatible type,
  which may lead to a crash.\n\nThe main use case of Convict is for handling server-side
  configurations written by the admins owning the servers, and not random users. So
  it's unlikely that an admin would deliberately sabotage their own server. Still
  a situation can happen where an admin not knowledgeable about JavaScript could be
  tricked by an attacker into writing the malicious JavaScript code into some config
  files."
