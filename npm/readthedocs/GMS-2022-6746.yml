title: "Read the Docs vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
description: "This vulnerability allowed a malicious user to serve arbitrary HTML 
  files from the main application domain (readthedocs.org/readthedocs.com) by exploiting 
  a vulnerability in the code that serves downloadable content from a project. Exploiting 
  this would have required the attacker to get a logged-in user to visit the malicious 
  URL, which would have allowed the attacker to take control of the user's session with 
  JavaScript (making requests to the API/site on behalf of the user). This URL would have 
  looked something like 
  https://readthedocs.org/projects/attacker-project/downloads/html/version-with-javascript-attack/."
