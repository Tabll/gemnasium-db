description: "The npm package `rc` had versions published with malicious code. Users
  of affected versions (1.2.9, 1.3.9, and 2.3.9) should downgrade to 1.2.8 as soon
  as possible and check their systems for suspicious activity.\nAny computer that
  has this package installed or running should be considered fully compromised. All
  secrets and keys stored on that computer should be rotated immediately from a different
  computer. The package should be removed, but as full control of the computer may
  have been given to an outside entity, there is no guarantee that removing the package
  will remove all malicious software resulting from installing it."
