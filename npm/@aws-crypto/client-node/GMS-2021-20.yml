title: "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature in aws-encryption-sdk-javascript "
description: "This ESDK supports a streaming mode where callers may stream the plaintext
  of signed messages before the ECDSA signature is validated. In addition to these
  signatures, the ESDK uses AES-GCM encryption and all plaintext is verified before
  being released to a caller. There is no impact on the integrity of the ciphertext
  or decrypted plaintext, however some callers may rely on the the ECDSA signature
  for non-repudiation. Without validating the ECDSA signature, an actor with trusted
  KMS permissions to decrypt a message may also be able to encrypt messages. This
  update introduces a new API for callers who wish to stream only unsigned messages."
