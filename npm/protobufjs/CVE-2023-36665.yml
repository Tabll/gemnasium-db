identifiers:

package_slug: "npm/protobufjs"
title: "Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype
  Pollution')"
description: "protobuf.js (aka protobufjs) 6.10.0 through 7.x before 7.2.4 allows
  Prototype Pollution, a different vulnerability than CVE-2022-25878. A user-controlled
  protobuf message can be used by an attacker to pollute the prototype of Object.prototype
  by adding and overwriting its data and functions. Exploitation can involve: (1)
  using the function parse to parse protobuf messages on the fly, (2) loading .proto
  files by using load/loadSync functions, or (3) providing untrusted input to the
  functions ReflectionObject.setParsedOption and util.setProperty. NOTE: this CVE
  Record is about \"Object.constructor.prototype.<new-property> = ...;\" whereas CVE-2022-25878
  was about \"Object.__proto__.<new-property> = ...;\" instead."
