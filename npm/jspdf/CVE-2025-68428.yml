title: "jsPDF has Local File Inclusion/Path Traversal vulnerability"
description: "User control of the first argument of the loadFile method in the node.js
  build allows local file inclusion/path traversal.\n\nIf given the possibility to
  pass unsanitized paths to the loadFile method, a user can retrieve file contents
  of arbitrary files in the local file system the node process is running in. The
  file contents are included verbatim in the generated PDFs.\n\nOther affected methods
  are: `addImage`, `html`, `addFont`.\n\nOnly the node.js builds of the library are
  affected, namely the `dist/jspdf.node.js` and `dist/jspdf.node.min.js` files.\n\nExample
  attack vector:\n\n```js\nimport { jsPDF } from \"./dist/jspdf.node.js\";\n\nconst
  doc = new jsPDF();\n\ndoc.addImage(\"./secret.txt\", \"JPEG\", 0, 0, 10, 10);\ndoc.save(\"test.pdf\");
  // the generated PDF will contain the \"secret.txt\" file\n```"
