package_slug: "npm/jspdf"
title: "jsPDF Affected by Client-Side/Server-Side Denial of Service via Malicious
  GIF Dimensions"
description: "User control of the first argument of the `addImage` method results
  in denial of service.\n\nIf given the possibility to pass unsanitized image data
  or URLs to the `addImage` method, a user can provide a harmful GIF file that results
  in out of memory errors and denial of service. Harmful GIF files have large width
  and/or height entries in their headers, wich lead to excessive memory allocation.\n\nOther
  affected methods are: `html`.\n\nExample attack vector:\n\n```js\nimport { jsPDF
  } from \"jspdf\"\n\n// malicious GIF image data with large width/height headers\nconst
  payload = ...\n\nconst doc = new jsPDF();\n\ndoc.addImage(payload, \"GIF\", 0, 0,
  100, 100);\n```"
