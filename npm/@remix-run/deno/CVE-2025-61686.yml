title: "React Router has Path Traversal in File Session Storage"
description: "If applications use `createFileSessionStorage()` from `@react-router/node`
  (or `@remix-run/node`/`@remix-run/deno` in Remix v2) with an [**unsigned cookie**](https://reactrouter.com/explanation/sessions-and-cookies#signing-cookies),
  it is possible for an attacker to cause the session to try to read/write from a
  location outside the specified session file directory. The success of the attack
  would depend on the permissions of the web server process to access those files.\n\nRead
  files cannot be returned directly to the attacker.  Session file reads would only
  succeed if the file matched the expected session file format. If the file matched
  the session file format, the data would be populated into the server side session
  but not directly returned to the attacker unless the application logic returned
  specific session information."
