package_slug: "npm/class-validator"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')"
description: "In TypeStack class-validat, validate() input validation can be bypassed
  because certain internal attributes can be overwritten via a conflicting name. Even
  though there is an optional forbidUnknownValues parameter that can be used to reduce
  the risk of this bypass, this option is not documented and thus most developers
  configure input validation in the vulnerable default manner. With this vulnerability,
  attackers can launch SQL Injection or XSS attacks by injecting arbitrary malicious
  input. NOTE: a software maintainer agrees with the \"is not documented\" finding
  but suggests that much of the responsibility for the risk lies in a different product."
