package_slug: "npm/pbkdf2"
title: "pbkdf2 returns predictable uninitialized/zero-filled memory for non-normalized
  or unimplemented algos"
description: "This affects both:\n1. Unsupported algos (e.g. `sha3-256` / `sha3-512`
  / `sha512-256`)\n2. Supported but non-normalized algos (e.g. `Sha256` / `Sha512`
  / `SHA1` / `sha-1` / `sha-256` / `sha-512`)\n\nAll of those work correctly in Node.js,
  but this polyfill silently returns highly predictable ouput\n\nUnder Node.js (only
  with `pbkdf2/browser` import, unlikely) / Bun (`pbkdf2` top-level import is affected),
  the memory is not zero-filled but is uninitialized, as `Buffer.allocUnsafe` is used\n\nUnder
  browsers, it just returns zero-filled buffers\n(Which is also critical, those are
  completely unacceptable as kdf output and ruin security)"
