package_slug: "npm/nuxt-api-party"
title: "Uncontrolled Recursion"
description: "`nuxt-api-party` is an open source module to proxy API requests. The
  library allows the user to send many options directly to `ofetch`. There is no filter
  on which options are available. We can abuse the retry logic to cause the server
  to crash from a stack overflow. fetchOptions are obtained directly from the request
  body. A malicious user can construct a URL known to not fetch successfully, then
  set the retry attempts to a high value, this will cause a stack overflow as ofetch
  error handling works recursively resulting in a denial of service. This issue has
  been addressed in version 0.22.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to
  upgrade should limit ofetch options."
