title: "Denial of Service in content"
description: "Versions of `content` are vulnerable to Denial of Service. The Content-Encoding
  HTTP header parser has a vulnerability which will cause the function to throw a
  system error if the header contains some invalid values. Because hapi rethrows system
  errors (as opposed to catching expected application errors), the error is thrown
  all the way up the stack. If no unhandled exception handler is available, the application
  will exist, allowing an attacker to shut down services."
