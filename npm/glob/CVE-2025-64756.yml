title: "glob CLI: Command injection via -c/--cmd executes matches with shell:true"
description: "The glob CLI contains a command injection vulnerability in its `-c/--cmd`
  option that allows arbitrary command execution when processing files with malicious
  names. When `glob -c <command> <patterns>` is used, matched filenames are passed
  to a shell with `shell: true`, enabling shell metacharacters in filenames to trigger
  command injection and achieve arbitrary code execution under the user or CI account
  privileges."
