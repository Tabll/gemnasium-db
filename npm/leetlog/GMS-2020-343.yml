description: " of `leetlog` contain malicious code. The package adds an arbitrary
  hardcoded SSH key identified as `hacker@evilmachine` to the system's `authorized_keys`
  ## Recommendation\n\nAny computer that has this package installed or running should
  be considered fully compromised. All secrets and keys stored on that computer should
  be rotated immediately from a different computer.\n\nThe package should be removed,

  is no guarantee that removing the package will remove all malicious software resulting
  from installing it."
