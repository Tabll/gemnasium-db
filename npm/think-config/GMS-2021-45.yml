title: "Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes"
description: "### Impact\n\nThe software receives input from an upstream component
  that specifies attributes that are to be initialized or updated in an object, but
  it does not properly control modifications of attributes of the object prototype.\n\n###
  Patches\n\n`think-config@1.1.3` patched it, anyone used `think-config` should upgrade
  to `>=1.1.3` version.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1321.html\n\n###
