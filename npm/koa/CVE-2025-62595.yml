title: "Koa Vulnerable to Open Redirect via Trailing Double-Slash (//) in back Redirect
  Logic"
description: "A bypass was discovered in the `Koa.js` framework affecting its back
  redirect functionality. In certain circumstances, an attacker can manipulate the
  Referer header to force a user’s browser to navigate to an external, potentially
  malicious website. This occurs because the implementation incorrectly treats some
  specially crafted URLs as safe relative paths. Exploiting this vulnerability could
  allow attackers to perform phishing, social engineering, or other redirect-based
  attacks on users of affected applications.\n\nThis vulnerability affects the code
  referenced in GitHub Advisory GHSA-jgmv-j7ww-jx2x (which is tracked as CVE‑2025‑54420)."
