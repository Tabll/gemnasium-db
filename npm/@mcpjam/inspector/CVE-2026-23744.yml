title: "REC in MCPJam inspector due to HTTP Endpoint exposes"
description: "MCPJam inspector is the local-first development platform for MCP servers.
  The Latest version Versions 1.4.2 and earlier are vulnerable to remote code execution
  (RCE) vulnerability, which allows an attacker to send a crafted HTTP request that
  triggers the installation of an MCP server, leading to RCE.\n\nThis vulnerability
  is similar to CVE-2025-49596, but more severe. While CVE-2025-49596 requires tricking
  a user into clicking a malicious link, this vulnerability is exploitable with no
  user interaction. Since MCPJam inspector by default listens on 0.0.0.0 instead of
  127.0.0.1, an attacker can trigger the RCE remotely via a simple HTTP request."
