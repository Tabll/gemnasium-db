package_slug: "npm/cordova-plugin-fingerprint-aio"
title: "Reachable Assertion"
description: "cordova-plugin-fingerprint-aio is a plugin provides a single and simple
  interface for accessing fingerprint APIs on both Android 6+ and iOS. The exported
  activity `de.niklasmerz.cordova.biometric.BiometricActivity` can cause the app to
  crash. This vulnerability occurred because the activity didn't handle the case where
  it is requested with invalid or empty data which results in a crash. Any third party
  app can constantly call this activity with no permission. A 3rd party app/attacker
  using event listener can continually stop the app from working and make the victim
  unable to open it. of the cordova-plugin-fingerprint-aio does not export the activity
  anymore and is no longer vulnerable. If you want to fix older versions change the
  attribute android:exported in plugin.xml to false. Please upgrade to as soon as
  possible."
