package_slug: "npm/@dependencytrack/frontend"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "@dependencytrack/frontend is a Single Page Application (SPA) used in
  Dependency-Track, an open source Component Analysis platform that allows organizations
  to identify and reduce risk in the software supply chain. Due to the common practice
  of providing vulnerability details in markdown format, the Dependency-Track frontend
  renders them using the JavaScript library Showdown. Showdown does not have any XSS
  countermeasures built in, and versions before 4.6.1 of the Dependency-Track frontend
  does not encode or sanitize Showdown's output. This made it possible for arbitrary
  JavaScript included in vulnerability details via HTML attributes to be executed
  in context of the frontend. Actors with the `VULNERABILITY_MANAGEMENT` permission
  can exploit this weakness by creating or editing a custom vulnerability and providing
  XSS payloads in any of the following fields: Description, Details, Recommendation,
  or References. The payload will be executed for users with the `VIEW_PORTFOLIO`
  permission when browsing to the modified vulnerability's page. Alternatively, malicious
  JavaScript could be introduced via any of the vulnerability databases mirrored by
  Dependency-Track. However, this attack vector is highly unlikely, and the maintainers
  of Dependency-Track are not aware of any occurrence of this happening. Note that
  the `Vulnerability Details` element of the `Audit Vulnerabilities` tab in the project
  view is not affected. The issue has been fixed in frontend version 4.6.1."
