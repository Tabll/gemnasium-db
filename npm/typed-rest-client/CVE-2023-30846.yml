package_slug: "npm/typed-rest-client"
title: "Insufficiently Protected Credentials"
description: "typed-rest-client is a library for Node Rest and Http Clients with typings
  for use with TypeScript. Users of the typed-rest-client library version 1.7.3 or
  lower is vulnerable to leak authentication data to 3rd parties. The flow of the
  vulnerability is as follows: First, send any request with `BasicCredentialHandler`,
  `BearerCredentialHandler` or `PersonalAccessTokenCredentialHandler`. Second, the
  target host may return a redirection (3xx), with a link to a second host. Third,
  the next request will use the credentials to authenticate with the second host,
  by setting the `Authorization` header. The expected behavior is that the next request
  will *NOT* set the `Authorization` header. The problem was fixed in version 1.8.0.
  There are no known workarounds."
