package_slug: "npm/cipher-base"
title: "cipher-base is missing type checks, leading to hash rewind and passing on
  crafted data"
description: "This affects e.g. `create-hash` (and `crypto-browserify`), so I'll describe
  the issue against that package\nAlso affects `create-hmac` and other packages\n\nNode.js
  `createHash` works only on strings or instances of Buffer, TypedArray, or DataView.\n\nMissing
  input type checks (in npm `create-hash` polyfill of Node.js `createHash`) can allow
  types other than a well-formed `Buffer` or `string`, resulting in invalid values,
  hanging and rewinding the hash state (including turning a tagged hash into an untagged
  hash), or other generally undefined behaviour."
