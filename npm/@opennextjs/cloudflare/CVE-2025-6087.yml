title: "OpenNext for Cloudflare (opennextjs-cloudflare) has a SSRF vulnerability via
  /_next/image endpoint"
description: "A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability was identified in
  the @opennextjs/cloudflare package.\n\nThe vulnerability stems from an unimplemented
  feature in the Cloudflare adapter for Open Next, which allowed unauthenticated users
  to proxy arbitrary remote content via the `/_next/image` endpoint.\n\nThis issue
  allowed attackers to load remote resources from arbitrary hosts under the victim
  site’s domain for any site deployed using the Cloudflare adapter for Open Next.
  \ For example: `https://victim-site.com/_next/image?url=https://attacker.com`. In
  this example, attacker-controlled content from attacker.com is served through the
  victim site’s domain (`victim-site.com`), violating the same-origin policy and potentially
  misleading users or other services."
