title: "@nyariv/sandboxjs has Sandbox Escape via Prototype `Whitelist` Bypass and
  Host Prototype Pollution"
description: "A sandbox escape is possible by shadowing `hasOwnProperty` on a sandbox
  object, which disables prototype `whitelist` enforcement in the property-access
  path. This permits direct access to `__proto__` and other blocked prototype properties,
  enabling **host `Object.prototype` pollution** and persistent cross-sandbox impact.\n\nThe
  issue was reproducible on Node `v23.9.0` using the project’s current build output.
  The bypass works with default `Sandbox` configuration and does not require custom
  globals or `whitelist`s."
