title: "@nyariv/sandboxjs has host prototype pollution from sandbox via array intermediary
  (sandbox escape)"
description: "A sandbox escape vulnerability allows sandboxed code to mutate host
  built-in prototypes by laundering the `isGlobal` protection flag through array literal
  intermediaries. When a global prototype reference (e.g., `Map.prototype`, `Set.prototype`)
  is placed into an array and retrieved, the `isGlobal` taint is stripped, permitting
  direct prototype mutation from within the sandbox. This results in persistent host-side
  prototype pollution and may enable RCE in applications that use polluted properties
  in sensitive sinks (example gadget: `execSync(obj.cmd)`)."
