title: "@nyariv/sandboxjs has Prototype Pollution vulnerability that may lead to RCE"
description: "A prototype pollution vulnerability exists in @nyariv/sandboxjs versions
  <= 0.8.23, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary properties into Object.prototype
  via crafted JavaScript code. This can result in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition
  or, under certain conditions, escape the sandboxed environment intended to restrict
  code execution. The vulnerability stems from insufficient prototype access checks
  in the sandboxâ€™s executor logic, particularly in the handling of JavaScript function
  objects returned."
