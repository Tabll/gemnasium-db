title: "counterpart vulnerable to prototype pollution"
description: "A vulnerability exists in the `counterpart` library for Node.js and
  the browser due to insufficient sanitization of user-controlled input in translation
  key processing. The affected versions prior to 0.18.6 allow attackers to manipulate
  the library's translation functionality by supplying maliciously crafted keys containing
  prototype chain elements (e.g., __proto__ ), leading to prototype pollution. This
  weakness enables adversaries to inject arbitrary properties into the JavaScript
  Object prototype through the first parameter of the translate method when combined
  with specific separator configurations, potentially resulting in denial-of-service
  conditions or remote code execution in vulnerable applications. The issue arises
  from the library's failure to properly validate or neutralize special characters
  in translation key inputs before processing."
