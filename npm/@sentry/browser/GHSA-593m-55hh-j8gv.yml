title: "Sentry SDK Prototype Pollution gadget in JavaScript SDKs"
description: "In case a Prototype Pollution vulnerability is present in a user's application
  or bundled libraries, the Sentry SDK could potentially serve as a gadget to exploit
  that vulnerability. The exploitability depends on the specific details of the underlying
  Prototype Pollution issue.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> This advisory does not indicate the presence
  of a Prototype Pollution within the Sentry SDK itself. Users are strongly advised
  to first address any Prototype Pollution vulnerabilities in their application, as
  they pose a more critical security risk."
