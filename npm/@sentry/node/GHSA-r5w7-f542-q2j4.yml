title: "Potential DoS when using ContextLines integration"
description: "The [ContextLines integration](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/node/configuration/integrations/contextlines/)
  uses readable streams to more efficiently use memory when reading files. The ContextLines
  integration is used to attach source context to outgoing events.\n\nThe stream was
  not explicitly closed after use. This could lead to excessive amounts of file handles
  open on the system and potentially lead to a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nThe ContextLines
  integration is enabled by default in the Node SDK (`@sentry/node`) and SDKs that
  run in Node.js environments (`@sentry/astro`, `@sentry/aws-serverless`, `@sentry/bun`,
  `@sentry/google-cloud-serverless`, `@sentry/nestjs`, `@sentry/nextjs`, `@sentry/nuxt`,
  `@sentry/remix`, `@sentry/solidstart`, `@sentry/sveltekit`)."
