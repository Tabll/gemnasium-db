title: "Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype
  Pollution')"
description: "hoolock is a suite of lightweight utilities designed to maintain a small
  footprint when bundled. Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior to version 2.2.1, utility
  functions related to object paths (`get`, `set`, and `update`) does not block attempts
  to access or alter object prototypes. Starting in version 2.2.1, the `get`, `set`
  and `update` functions throw a `TypeError` when a user attempts to access or alter
  inherited properties."
