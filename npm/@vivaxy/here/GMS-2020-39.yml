package_slug: "npm/@vivaxy/here"
title: "Directory Traversal in @vivaxy/here"
description: "The @vivaxy/here module is a small web server that serves files with
  the process' working directory acting as the web root.\n\nIt is vulnerable to a
  directory traversal attack. \n\nThis means that files on the local file system which
  exist outside of the web root may be disclosed to an attacker. This might include
  confidential files.\n\nMitigating Factors:\nIf the node process is run as a user
  with very limited filesystem permissions, there is significantly less risk of exposing
  confidential/private information. Proof of Concept:\n```\ncurl \"http://${SERVER_IP}:${SERVER_PORT}/..%2f..%2fetc/passwd\"\n```
  ## Recommendation\n\nRun `npm i @vivaxy/here` to install the latest version that
  addresses this vulnerability."
