package_slug: "npm/snowflake-sdk"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')"
description: "snowflake-connector-nodejs, a NodeJS driver for Snowflake, is vulnerable
  to command injection via single sign on (SSO) browser URL authentication in versions
  prior to 1.6.21. In order to exploit the potential for command injection, an attacker
  would need to be successful in (1) establishing a malicious resource and (2) redirecting
  users to utilize the resource. The attacker could set up a malicious, publicly accessible
  server which responds to the SSO URL with an attack payload. If the attacker then
  tricked a user into visiting the maliciously crafted connection URL, the userâ€™s
  local machine would render the malicious payload, leading to a remote code execution.
  This attack scenario can be mitigated through URL allow listing as well as common
  anti-phishing resources. Version 1.6.21 contains a patch for this issue."
