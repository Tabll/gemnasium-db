title: "snowflake-sdk may incorrectly validate temporary credential cache file permissions"
description: "### Issue\nSnowflake discovered and remediated a vulnerability in the
  Snowflake NodeJS Driver. File permissions checks of the temporary credential cache
  could be bypassed by an attacker with write access to the local cache directory.\n\nThis
  vulnerability affects versions 1.12.0 through 2.0.1 on Linux. Snowflake fixed the
  issue in version 2.0.2.\n\n### Vulnerability Details\nOn Linux, when either EXTERNALBROWSER
  or USERNAME_PASSWORD_MFA authentication methods are used with temporary credential
  caching enabled, the Snowflake NodeJS Driver will cache temporary credentials in
  a local file. Due to a bug, the check verifying that the cache file can be accessed
  only by the user running the Driver always succeeded, but didnâ€™t verify the permissions
  or the ownership correctly. An attacker with write access to the local cache folder
  could plant an empty file there and the Driver would use it to store temporary credentials
  instead of rejecting it due to overly broad permissions.\n\n### Solution\nSnowflake
  released version 2.0.2 of the Snowflake NodeJS Driver, which fixes this issue. We
  recommend users upgrade to version 2.0.2.\n\n### Additional Information\nIf you
  discover a security vulnerability in one of our products or websites, please report
  the issue to HackerOne. For more information, please see our [Vulnerability Disclosure
  Policy](https://hackerone.com/snowflake?type=team)."
