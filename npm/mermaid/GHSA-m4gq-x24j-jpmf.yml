title: "Prototype pollution vulnerability found in Mermaid's bundled version of DOMPurify"
description: "The following bundled files within the Mermaid NPM package contain a
  bundled version of DOMPurify that is vulnerable to https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/security/advisories/GHSA-mmhx-hmjr-r674,
  potentially resulting in an XSS attack.\n\nThis affects the built:\n\n- `dist/mermaid.min.js`\n-
  `dist/mermaid.js`\n- `dist/mermaid.esm.mjs`\n- `dist/mermaid.esm.min.mjs`\n\nThis
  will also affect users that use the above files via a CDN link, e.g. `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid@10.9.2/dist/mermaid.min.js`\n\n**Users
  that use the default NPM export of `mermaid`, e.g. `import mermaid from 'mermaid'`,
  or the `dist/mermaid.core.mjs` file, do not use this bundled version of DOMPurify,
  and can easily update using their package manager with something like `npm audit
  fix`.**"
