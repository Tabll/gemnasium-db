package_slug: "npm/mermaid"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream
  Component ('Injection')"
description: "Mermaid is a JavaScript based diagramming and charting tool that uses
  Markdown-inspired text definitions and a renderer to create and modify complex diagrams.
  An attacker is able to inject arbitrary `CSS` into the generated graph allowing
  them to change the styling of elements outside of the generated graph, and potentially
  exfiltrate sensitive information by using specially crafted `CSS` selectors. The
  following example shows how an attacker can exfiltrate the contents of an input
  field by bruteforcing the `value` attribute one character at a time. Whenever there
  is an actual match, an `http` request will be made by the browser in order to \"load\"
  a background image that will let an attacker know what's the value of the character.
  This issue may lead to `Information Disclosure` via CSS selectors and functions
  able to generate HTTP requests. This also allows an attacker to change the document
  in ways which may lead a user to perform unintended actions, such as clicking on
  a link, etc. This issue has been resolved in version 9.1.3. Users are advised to
  upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that user input is adequately escaped
  before embedding it in CSS blocks."
