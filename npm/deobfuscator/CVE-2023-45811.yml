title: "Synchrony deobfuscator prototype pollution vulnerability leading to arbitrary
  code execution"
description: "A `__proto__` pollution vulnerability exists in the [LiteralMap] transformer
  allowing crafted input to modify properties in the Object prototype.\n\nWhen executing
  in Node.js, due to use of the `prettier` module, defining a `parser` property on
  `__proto__` with a path to a JS module on disk [causes a `require` of the value][prettier/src/main/parser.js]
  which can lead to arbitrary code execution."
