package_slug: "npm/npm-test-sqlite3-trunk"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command
  Injection')"
description: "The npm-test-sqlite3-trunk module provides asynchronous, non-blocking
  SQLite3 bindings. npm-test-sqlite3-trunk downloads binary resources over HTTP, which
  leaves it vulnerable to MITM attacks. It may be possible to cause remote code execution
  (RCE) by swapping out the requested resources with an attacker controlled copy if
  the attacker is on the network or positioned in between the user and the remote
  server."
