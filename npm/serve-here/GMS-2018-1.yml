title: "Directory Traversal"
description: "serve-here is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack. This means
  that files on the local file system which exist outside of the web root may be disclosed
  to an attacker. This might include confidential files. Mitigating Factors: if the
  node process is run as a user with very limited filesystem permissions, there is
  significantly less risk of exposing confidential/private information."
