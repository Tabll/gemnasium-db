title: "HFS user adding a \"web link\" in HFS is vulnerable to \"target=_blank\" exploit"
description: "When adding a \"web link\" to the HFS virtual filesystem, the frontend
  opens it with `target=\"_blank\"` but without the `rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"`
  attribute. This allows the opened page to use the `window.opener` property to change
  the location of the original HFS tab."
