title: "Prototype Pollution in @hapi/subtext"
description: "Versions of `@hapi/pez` prior to 4.1.2 or 5.0.1 are vulnerable to Prototype
  Pollution. A multipart payload can be constructed in a way that one of the parts’
  content can be set as the entire payload object’s prototype. If this prototype contains
  data, it may bypass other validation rules which enforce access and privacy. If
  this prototype evaluates to null, it can cause unhandled exceptions when the request
  payload is accessed."
