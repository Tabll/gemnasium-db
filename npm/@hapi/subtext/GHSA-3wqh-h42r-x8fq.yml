title: "Denial of Service in @hapi/subtext"
description: "Versions of `@hapi/subtext` prior to 6.1.3 or 7.0.3 are vulnerable to
  Denial of Service. The Content-Encoding HTTP header parser has a vulnerability which
  will cause the function to throw a system error if the header contains some invalid
  values. Because hapi rethrows system errors (as opposed to catching expected application
  errors), the error is thrown all the way up the stack. If no unhandled exception
  handler is available, the application will exist, allowing an attacker to shut down
  services."
