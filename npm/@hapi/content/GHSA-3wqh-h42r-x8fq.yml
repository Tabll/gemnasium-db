title: "Denial of Service in @hapi/content"
description: "Versions of `@hapi/content` prior to 4.1.1 and 5.0.1 are vulnerable
  to Denial of Service. The Content-Encoding HTTP header parser has a vulnerability
  which will cause the function to throw a system error if the header contains some
  invalid values. Because hapi rethrows system errors (as opposed to catching expected
  application errors), the error is thrown all the way up the stack. If no unhandled
  exception handler is available, the application will exist, allowing an attacker
  to shut down services."
