title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "CKEditor4 is an open source what-you-see-is-what-you-get HTML editor.
  A cross-site scripting vulnerability has been discovered affecting Iframe Dialog
  and Media Embed packages. The vulnerability may trigger a JavaScript code after
  fulfilling special conditions: using one of the affected packages on a web page
  with missing proper Content Security Policy configuration; initializing the editor
  on an element and using an element other than `<textarea>` as a base; and destroying
  the editor instance. This vulnerability might affect a small percentage of integrators
  that depend on dynamic editor initialization/destroy mechanism. A fix is available
  in CKEditor4 version 4.21.0. In some rare cases, a security fix may be considered
  a breaking change. Starting from version 4.21.0, the Iframe Dialog plugin applies
  the `sandbox` attribute by default, which restricts JavaScript code execution in
  the iframe element. To change this behavior, configure the `config.iframe_attributes`
  option. Also starting from version 4.21.0, the Media Embed plugin regenerates the
  entire content of the embed widget by default. To change this behavior, configure
  the `config.embed_keepOriginalContent` option. Those who choose to enable either
  of the more permissive options or who cannot upgrade to a patched version should
  properly configure Content Security Policy to avoid any potential security issues
  that may arise from embedding iframe elements on their web page."
