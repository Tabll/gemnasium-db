title: "CKEditor4 low-risk cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability linked to potential
  domain takeover"
description: "A theoretical vulnerability has been identified in CKEditor 4.22 (and
  above). In a highly unlikely scenario where an attacker gains control over the https://cke4.ckeditor.com
  domain, they could potentially execute an attack on CKEditor 4 instances. Although

  to ensure compliance with security best practices."
