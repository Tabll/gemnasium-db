description: "alto-saxophone is a module to install and launch Chromedriver for Mac,
  Linux or Windows. alto-saxophone versions below 2.25.1 download binary resources
  over HTTP, which leaves it vulnerable to MITM attacks. It may be possible to cause
  remote code execution (RCE) by swapping out the requested binary with an attacker
  controlled binary if the attacker is on the network or positioned in between the
  user and the remote server."
