package_slug: "npm/mongodb-client-encryption"
title: "Improper Certificate Validation"
description: "A specific version of the Node.js mongodb-client-encryption module does
  not perform correct validation of the KMS server’s certificate. This vulnerability
  in combination with a privileged network position active MITM attack could result
  in interception of traffic between the Node.js driver and the KMS service rendering
  client-side field level encryption (CSFLE) ineffective. This issue was discovered
  during internal testing and affects mongodb-client-encryption module, which was
  available from and deprecated in the NPM Registry on . This vulnerability does not
  impact driver traffic payloads with CSFLE-supported key services from applications
  residing inside the AWS, GCP, and Azure nework fabrics due to compensating controls
  in these environments. This issue does not impact driver workloads that don’t use
  Field Level Encryption."
