package_slug: "npm/geonode"
title: "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
description: "GeoNode is an open source platform that facilitates the creation, sharing,
  and collaborative use of geospatial data. In versions 3.2.0 through 4.1.2, the endpoint
  `/proxy/?url=` does not properly protect against server-side request forgery. This
  allows an attacker to port scan internal hosts and request information from internal
  hosts. A patch is available at commit a9eebae80cb362009660a1fd49e105e7cdb499b9."
