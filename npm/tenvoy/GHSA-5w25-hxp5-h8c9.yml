title: "Duplicate Advisory: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature"
description: "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-7r96-8g3x-g36m. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n## Original Description\ntEnvoy contains the PGP, NaCl, and PBKDF2
  in node.js and the browser (hashing, random, encryption, decryption, signatures,
  conversions), used by TogaTech.org. In versions prior to 7.0.3, the `verifyWithMessage`
  method of `tEnvoyNaClSigningKey` always returns `true` for any signature that has
  a SHA-512 hash matching the SHA-512 hash of the message even if the signature was
  invalid. This issue is patched in version 7.0.3. As a workaround: In `tenvoy.js`
  under the `verifyWithMessage` method definition within the `tEnvoyNaClSigningKey`
  class, ensure that the return statement call to `this.verify` ends in `.verified`."
