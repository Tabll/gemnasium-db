package_slug: "npm/seroval"
title: "seroval affected by Denial of Service via RegExp serialization"
description: "Overriding RegExp serialization with extremely large patterns can **exhaust
  JavaScript runtime memory** during deserialization. Additionally, overriding RegExp
  serialization with patterns that trigger **catastrophic backtracking** can lead
  to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service).\n\n**Mitigation**:\n`Seroval` introduces
  `disabledFeatures` (a bitmask) in serialization/deserialization methods, with `Feature.RegExp`
  as a dedicated flag. **Users are recommended to configure `disabledFeatures` to
  disable RegExp serialization entirely.**"
