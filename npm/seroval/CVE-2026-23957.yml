title: "Seroval affected by Denial of Service via Array serialization"
description: "Overriding encoded array lengths by replacing them with an excessively
  large value causes the deserialization process to **significantly increase processing
  time**.\n\n**Mitigation**:\n`Seroval` no longer encodes array lengths.\nInstead,
  it computes length using `Array.prototype.length` during deserialization."
