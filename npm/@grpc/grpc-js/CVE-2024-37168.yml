title: "@grpc/grpc-js can allocate memory for incoming messages well above configured
  limits"
description: "There are two separate code paths in which memory can be allocated per
  message in excess of the `grpc.max_receive_message_length` channel option:\n\n1.
  If an incoming message has a size on the wire greater than the configured limit,
  the entire message is buffered before it is discarded.\n2. If an incoming message
  has a size within the limit on the wire but decompresses to a size greater than
  the limit, the entire message is decompressed into memory, and on the server is
  not discarded."
