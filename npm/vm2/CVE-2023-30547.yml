description: "vm2 is a sandbox that can run untrusted code with allow listed Node's
  built-in modules. There exists a vulnerability in exception sanitization of vm2
  for versions up to 3.9.16, allowing attackers to raise an unsanitized host exception
  inside `handleException()` which can be used to escape the sandbox and run arbitrary
  code in host context. This vulnerability was patched in the release of version `3.9.17`
  of `vm2`. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. Users are advised
