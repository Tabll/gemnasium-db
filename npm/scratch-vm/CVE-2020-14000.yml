identifier: "CVE-2020-14000"
package_slug: "npm/scratch-vm"
title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "MIT Lifelong Kindergarten Scratch scratch-vm loads extension URLs from
  untrusted `project.json` files with certain `_` characters, resulting in remote code
  execution because the URL content is treated as a script and is executed as a worker.
  The responsible code is `getExtensionIdForOpcode` in `serialization/sb3.js`. The
  use of `_` is incompatible with a protection mechanism in older versions, in which
  URLs were split and consequently deserialization attacks were prevented."
