title: "locutus is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution"
description: "A Prototype Pollution vulnerability exists in the the npm package locutus
  (>2.0.12). Despite a previous fix that attempted to mitigate Prototype Pollution
  by checking whether user input contained a forbidden key, it is still possible to
  pollute Object.prototype via a crafted input using String.prototype. This issue
  was fixed in version 2.0.39."
