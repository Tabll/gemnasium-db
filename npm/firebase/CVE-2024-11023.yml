title: "Firebase JavaScript SDK allows attackers to manipulate the \"_authTokenSyncURL\"
  to point to their own server"
description: "Firebase JavaScript SDK utilizes a \"FIREBASE_DEFAULTS\" cookie to store
  configuration data, including an \"_authTokenSyncURL\" field used for session synchronization.
  \ If this cookie field is preset via an attacker by any other method, the attacker
  can manipulate the \"_authTokenSyncURL\" to point to their own server and it would
  allow am actor to capture user session data transmitted by the SDK. We recommend
  upgrading Firebase JS SDK at least to 10.9.0."
