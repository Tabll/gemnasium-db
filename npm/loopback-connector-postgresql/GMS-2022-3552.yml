title: "Duplicate of ./npm/loopback-connector-postgresql/CVE-2022-35942.yml"
description: "Improper input validation on the `contains` LoopBack filter may allow
  for arbitrary SQL injection.\n\n### Impact\n\nWhen the extended filter property
  `contains` is permitted to be interpreted by the Postgres connector, it is possible
  to inject arbitrary SQL which may affect the confidentiality and integrity of data
  stored on the connected database.\n\nThis affects users who does any of the following:\n\n-
  Connect to the database via the DataSource with `allowExtendedProperties: true`
  setting OR\n- Uses the connector's CRUD methods directly OR\n- Uses the connector's
  other methods to interpret the LoopBack filter.\n\n### Patches\n\nPatch release
  `loopback-connector-postgresql@5.5.1` has been published of which resolves this
  issue.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers who are unable to upgrade should do the following
  if applicable:\n\n- Remove `allowExtendedProperties: true` DataSource setting\n-
  Add `allowExtendedProperties: false` DataSource setting\n- When passing directly
  to the connector functions, manually sanitize the user input for the `contains`
  LoopBack filter beforehand.\n\n"
