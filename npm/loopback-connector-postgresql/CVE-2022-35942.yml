package_slug: "npm/loopback-connector-postgresql"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')"
description: "Improper input validation on the `contains` LoopBack filter may allow
  for arbitrary SQL injection. When the extended filter property `contains` is permitted
  to be interpreted by the Postgres connector, it is possible to inject arbitrary
  SQL which may affect the confidentiality and integrity of data stored on the connected
  database. A patch was released in version 5.5.1. This affects users who does any
  of the following: - Connect to the database via the DataSource with `allowExtendedProperties:
  true` setting OR - Uses the connector's CRUD methods directly OR - Uses the connector's
  other methods to interpret the LoopBack filter. Users who are unable to upgrade
  should do the following if applicable: - Remove `allowExtendedProperties: true`
  DataSource setting - Add `allowExtendedProperties: false` DataSource setting - When
  passing directly to the connector functions, manually sanitize the user input for
  the `contains` LoopBack filter beforehand."
