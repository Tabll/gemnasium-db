title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command
  Injection')"
description: "libxl provides Node bindings for the libxl library for reading and writing
  excel (XLS and XLSX) spreadsheets. libxl downloads zipped resources over HTTP, which
  leaves it vulnerable to MITM attacks. It may be possible to cause remote code execution
  (RCE) by swapping out the requested zip file with an attacker controlled zip file
  if the attacker is on the network or positioned in between the user and the remote
  server."
