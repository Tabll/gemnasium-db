title: "Token Disclosure"
description: "When CORS is enabled on a hapi route handler, it is possible to set
  a crumb token for a different domain. An attacker would need to have an application
  consumer visit a site they control, request a route supporting CORS, and then retrieve
  the token. With this token, they could possibly make requests to non CORS routes
  as this user. A configuration and scenario where this would occur is unlikely, as
  most configurations will set CORS globally (where crumb is not used), or not at
  all."
