description: "The [AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) is
  an open-source framework for defining cloud infrastructure using code. Customers
  use it to create their own applications which are converted to AWS CloudFormation
  templates during deployment to a customerâ€™s AWS account. CDK contains pre-built
  components called \"[constructs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/constructs.html)\"
  that are higher-level abstractions providing defaults and best practices. This approach
  enables developers to use familiar programming languages to define complex cloud
  infrastructure more efficiently than writing raw CloudFormation templates."
