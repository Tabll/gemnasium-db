title: "AWS CDK CodePipeline: trusted entities are too broad"
description: "The [AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) is
  an open-source framework for defining cloud infrastructure using code. Users use
  it to create their own applications, which are converted to AWS CloudFormation templates
  during deployment to a user's AWS account. AWS CDK contains pre-built components
  called \"constructs,\" which are higher-level abstractions providing defaults and
  best practices. This approach enables developers to use familiar programming languages
  to define complex cloud infrastructure more efficiently than writing raw CloudFormation
  templates.\n\nThe [AWS CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/) construct
  deploys CodePipeline, a managed service that orchestrates software release processes
  through a series of stages, each comprising one or more actions executed by CodePipeline.
  To perform these actions, CodePipeline assumes IAM roles with permissions necessary
  for each step, allowing it to interact with AWS services and resources on behalf
  of the user.\n\nAn issue exists where, when using CDK to create a CodePipeline with
  the CDK Construct Library, CDK creates an AWS Identity and Access Management (AWS
  IAM) trust policy with overly broad permissions. Any user with unrestricted sts:AssumeRole
  permissions could assume that trust policy. This issue does not affect users who
  supply their own role for CodePipeline."
