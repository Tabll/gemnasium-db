title: "AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) IAM OIDC custom resource allows connection
  to unauthorized OIDC provider"
description: "Users who use IAM OIDC custom resource provider package will download
  CA Thumbprints as part of the custom resource workflow, https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/blob/d16482fc8a4a3e1f62751f481b770c09034df7d2/packages/%40aws-cdk/custom-resource-handlers/lib/aws-iam/oidc-handler/external.ts#L34.\n\nHowever,
  the current `tls.connect` method will always set `rejectUnauthorized: false` which
  is a potential security concern. CDK should follow the best practice and set `rejectUnauthorized:
  true`. However, this could be a breaking change for existing CDK applications and
  we should fix this with a feature flag.\n\nNote that this is marked as low severity
  Security advisory because the issuer url is provided by CDK users who define the
  CDK application. If they insist on connecting to a unauthorized OIDC provider, CDK
  should not disallow this. Additionally, the code block is run in a Lambda environment
  which mitigate the MITM attack.\n\nAs a best practice, CDK should still fix this
  issue under a feature flag to avoid regression.\n\n```\npackages/@aws-cdk/custom-resource-handlers/lib/aws-iam/oidc-handler/external.ts\n❯❱
  problem-based-packs.insecure-transport.js-node.bypass-tls-verification.bypass-tls-verification\nChecks
  for setting the environment variable NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED to 0, which disables
  TLS\nverification. This should only be used for debugging purposes. Setting the
  option rejectUnauthorized\nto false bypasses verification against the list of trusted
  CAs, which also leads to insecure\ntransport.\n```"
