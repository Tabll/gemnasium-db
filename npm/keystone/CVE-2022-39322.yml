description: "@keystone-6/core is a core package for Keystone 6, a content management
  system for Node.js. Starting with version 2.2.0 and prior to version 2.3.1, users
  who expected their `multiselect` fields to use the field-level access control -
  if configured - is vulnerable to their field-level access control not being used.
  List-level access control is not affected. Field-level access control for fields
  other than `multiselect` are not affected. Version 2.3.1 contains a fix for this
  issue. As a workaround, stop using the `multiselect` field."
