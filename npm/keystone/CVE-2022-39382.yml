title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream
  Component ('Injection')"
description: "Keystone is a headless CMS for Node.js â€” built with GraphQL and React.`@keystone-6/core@3.0.0
  || 3.0.1` users that use `NODE_ENV` to trigger security-sensitive functionality
  in their production builds is vulnerable to `NODE_ENV` being inlined to `\"development\"`
  for user code, irrespective of what your environment variables. If you do not use
  `NODE_ENV` in your user code to trigger security-sensitive functionality, you are
  not impacted by this vulnerability. Any dependencies that use `NODE_ENV` to trigger
  particular behaviors (optimizations, security or otherwise) should still respect
  your environment's configured `NODE_ENV` variable. The application's dependencies,
  as found in `node_modules` (including `@keystone-6/core`), are typically not compiled
  as part of this process, and thus should be unaffected. We have tested this assumption
  by verifying that `NODE_ENV=production yarn keystone start` still uses secure cookies
  when using `statelessSessions`. This vulnerability has been fixed in @keystone-6/core@3.0.2,
  regression tests have been added for this vulnerability in #8063."
