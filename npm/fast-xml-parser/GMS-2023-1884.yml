title: "fast-xml-parser regex vulnerability patch could be improved from a safety
  perspective"
description: "### Summary\nThis is a comment on 
  https://github.com/NaturalIntelligence/fast-xml-parser/security/advisories/GHSA-6w63-h3fj-q4vw
  and the patches fixing it.\n\n### Details\nThe code which validates a name calls
  the validator:\n
  https://github.com/NaturalIntelligence/fast-xml-parser/blob/ecf6016f9b48aec1a921e673158be0773d07283e/src/xmlparser/DocTypeReader.js#L145-L153\nThis
  checks for the presence of an invalid character. Such an approach is always risky,
  as it is so easy to forget to include an invalid character in the list. A safer
  approach is to validate entity names against the XML specification: 
  https://www.w3.org/TR/xml11/#sec-common-syn
  - an ENTITY name is a Name:\n\n```\n[4]  NameStartChar ::= \":\" | [A-Z] | \"_\"
  | [a-z] | [#xC0-#xD6] | [#xD8-#xF6] | [#xF8-#x2FF] | [#x370-#x37D] |\n [#x37F-#x1FFF]
  | [#x200C-#x200D] | [#x2070-#x218F] | [#x2C00-#x2FEF] | [#x3001-#xD7FF] |\n [#xF900-#xFDCF]
  | [#xFDF0-#xFFFD] | [#x10000-#xEFFFF]\n[4a] NameChar ::= NameStartChar | \"-\" |
  \".\" | [0-9] | #xB7 | [#x0300-#x036F] | [#x203F-#x2040]\n[5]  Name ::= NameStartChar
  (NameChar)*\n```\n\nso the safest way to validate an entity name is to build a regex
  to represent this expression and check whether the name given matches the regex.
  (Something along the lines of `/^[name start char class][name char class]*$/`.)
  There's probably a nice way to simplify the explicit list rather than typing it
  out verbatim using Unicode character properties, but I don't know enough to do so."
