package_slug: "npm/fast-xml-parser"
title: "fast-xml-parser has an entity encoding bypass via regex injection in DOCTYPE
  entity names"
description: "A dot (`.`) in a DOCTYPE entity name is treated as a regex wildcard
  during entity replacement, allowing an attacker to shadow built-in XML entities
  (`&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&amp;`, `&quot;`, `&apos;`) with arbitrary values. This bypasses
  entity encoding and leads to XSS when parsed output is rendered."
