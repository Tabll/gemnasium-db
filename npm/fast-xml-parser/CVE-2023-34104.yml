package_slug: "npm/fast-xml-parser"
title: "Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity"
description: "fast-xml-parser is an open source, pure javascript xml parser. fast-xml-parser
  allows special characters in entity names, which are not escaped or sanitized. Since
  the entity name is used for creating a regex for searching and replacing entities
  in the XML body, an attacker can abuse it for denial of service (DoS) attacks. By
  crafting an entity name that results in an intentionally bad performing regex and
  utilizing it in the entity replacement step of the parser, this can cause the parser
  to stall for an indefinite amount of time. This problem has been resolved in v4.2.4.
  Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should avoid using DOCTYPE
  parsing by setting the `processEntities: false` option."
