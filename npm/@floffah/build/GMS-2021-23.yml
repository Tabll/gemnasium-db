title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')
  in @floffah/build"
description: "### Impact\nIf you are using the esbuild target or command you are at
  risk of code/option injection. Attackers can use the command line option to maliciously
  change your settings in order to damage your project.\n\n### Patches\nThe problem
  has been patched in v1.0.0 as it uses a proper method to pass configs to esbuild/estrella.\n\n###
  Workarounds\nThere is no work around. You should update asap.\n\n### Notes\nThis
  notice is mainly just to make sure people update to the latest version. This isn't
  that bad, but should encourage you to update."
