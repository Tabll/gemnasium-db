title: "Regular Expression Denial of Service in markdown"
description: "All versions of `markdown` are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial
  of Service (ReDoS). The `markdown.toHTML()` function has significantly degraded
  performance when parsing long strings containing underscores. This may lead to Denial
  of Service if the parser accepts user input. No fix is currently available. Consider
  using an alternative package until a fix is made available."
