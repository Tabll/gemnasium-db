description: "All versions of `shrugging-logging` contain malicious code as a postinstall
  script. The package fetches all names of npm packages owned by the user and attempts
  to add another maintainer to every package as a means of package hijacking, ## Recommendation\n\nRemove
  the package from your system. If you own any packages that were compromised please
  contact npm security immediately at security@npmjs.com. Also enable 2FA for publishing
  to further secure packages you maintain."
