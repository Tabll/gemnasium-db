package_slug: "npm/angular-server-side-configuration"
title: "Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory"
description: "angular-server-side-configuration helps configure an angular application
  at runtime on the server or in a docker container via environment variables. angular-server-side-configuration
  detects used environment variables in TypeScript (.ts) files during build time of
  an Angular CLI project. The detected environment variables are written to a ngssc.json
  file in the output directory. During deployment of an Angular based app, the environment
  variables based on the variables from ngssc.json are inserted into the apps index.html
  (or defined index file). With version 15.0.0 the environment variable detection
  was widened to the entire project, relative to the angular.json file from the Angular
  CLI. In a monorepo setup, this could lead to environment variables intended for
  a backend/service to be detected and written to the ngssc.json, which would then
  be populated and exposed via index.html. This has NO IMPACT, in a plain Angular
  project that has no backend component. This vulnerability has been mitigated in
  version 15.1.0, by adding an option `searchPattern` which restricts the detection
  file range by default. As a workaround, manually edit or create ngssc.json or run
  script after ngssc.json generation."
