description: "All versions of this package contained malware. The package was designed
  to find and exfiltrate cryptocurrency wallets. Any computer that has this package
  installed or running should be considered fully compromised. All secrets and keys
  stored on that computer should be rotated immediately from a different computer.\n\nThe
  package should be removed, but as full control of the computer may have been given
  to an outside entity, there is no guarantee that removing the package will remove
  all malicious software resulting from installing it."
