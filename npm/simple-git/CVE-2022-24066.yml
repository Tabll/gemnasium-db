description: "The package simple-git before 3.5.0 is vulnerable to Command Injection
  due to an incomplete fix of [CVE-2022-24433](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-SIMPLEGIT-2421199)
  which only patches against the git fetch attack vector. A similar use of the --upload-pack
  feature of git is also supported for git clone, which the prior fix didn't cover."
