title: "Matrix JavaScript SDK's key history sharing could share keys to malicious
  devices"
description: "In matrix-js-sdk versions 9.11.0 through 34.7.0, the method `MatrixClient.sendSharedHistoryKeys`
  is vulnerable to interception by malicious homeservers.  The method implements functionality
  proposed in [MSC3061](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3061)
  and can be used by clients to share historical message keys with newly invited users,
  granting them access to past messages in the room.\n\nHowever, it unconditionally
  sends these \"shared\" keys to all of the invited user's devices, regardless of
  whether the user's cryptographic identity is verified or whether the user's devices
  are signed by that identity. This allows the attacker to potentially inject its
  own devices to receive sensitive historical keys without proper security checks.\n\nNote
  that this only affects clients running the SDK with the legacy crypto stack. Clients
  using the new Rust cryptography stack (i.e. those that call `MatrixClient.initRustCrypto()`
  instead of `MatrixClient.initCrypto()`) are unaffected by this vulnerability, because
  `MatrixClient.sendSharedHistoryKeys()` raises an exception in such environments."
