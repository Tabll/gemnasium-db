package_slug: "npm/matrix-js-sdk"
title: "Key Exchange without Entity Authentication"
description: "Matrix Javascript SDK is the Matrix Client-Server SDK for JavaScript.
  Prior to version 19.7.0, an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver can
  construct messages that legitimately appear to have come from another person, without
  any indication such as a grey shield. Additionally, a sophisticated attacker cooperating
  with a malicious homeserver could employ this vulnerability to perform a targeted
  attack in order to send fake to-device messages appearing to originate from another
  user. This can allow, for example, to inject the key backup secret during a self-verification,
  to make a targeted device start using a malicious key backup spoofed by the homeserver.
  These attacks are possible due to a protocol confusion vulnerability that accepts
  to-device messages encrypted with Megolm instead of Olm. Starting with version 19.7.0,
  matrix-js-sdk has been modified to only accept Olm-encrypted to-device messages.
  Out of caution, several other checks have been audited or added. This attack requires
  coordination between a malicious home server and an attacker, so those who trust
  their home servers do not need a workaround."
