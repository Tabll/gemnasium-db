description: "matrix-js-sdk is a Matrix messaging protocol Client-Server SDK for JavaScript.
  In versions prior to 24.0.0 events sent with special strings in key places can temporarily
  disrupt or impede the matrix-js-sdk from functioning properly, potentially impacting
  the consumer's ability to process data safely. Note that the matrix-js-sdk can appear
  to be operating normally but be excluding or corrupting runtime data presented to
  the consumer. This vulnerability is distinct from GHSA-rfv9-x7hh-xc32 which covers
  a similar issue. The issue has been patched in matrix-js-sdk 24.0.0 and users are
  advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
