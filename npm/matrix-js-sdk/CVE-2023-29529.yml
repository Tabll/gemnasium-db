title: "Missing Authorization"
description: "matrix-js-sdk is the Matrix Client-Server SDK for JavaScript and TypeScript.
  An attacker present in a room where an MSC3401 group call is taking place can eavesdrop
  on the video and audio of participants using matrix-js-sdk, without their knowledge.
  To affected matrix-js-sdk users, the attacker will not appear to be participating
  in the call. This attack is possible because matrix-js-sdk's group call implementation
  accepts incoming direct calls from other users, even if they have not yet declared
  intent to participate in the group call, as a means of resolving a race condition
  in call setup. Affected versions do not restrict access to the user's outbound media
  in this case. Legacy 1:1 calls are unaffected. This is fixed in matrix-js-sdk 24.1.0.
  As a workaround, users may hold group calls in private rooms where only the exact
  users who are expected to participate in the call are present."
