package_slug: "npm/matrix-js-sdk"
title: "matrix-js-sdk will freeze when a user sets a room with itself as a its predecessor"
description: "A malicious homeserver can craft a room or room structure such that
  the predecessors form a cycle. The matrix-js-sdk's `getRoomUpgradeHistory` function
  will infinitely recurse in this case, causing the code to hang. This method is public
  but also called by the 'leaveRoomChain()' method, so leaving a room will also trigger
  the bug."
