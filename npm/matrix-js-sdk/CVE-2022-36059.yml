package_slug: "npm/matrix-js-sdk"
title: "Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype
  Pollution')"
description: "matrix-js-sdk is a Matrix messaging protocol Client-Server SDK for JavaScript.
  In versions prior to 19.4.0 events sent with special strings in key places can temporarily
  disrupt or impede the matrix-js-sdk from functioning properly, potentially impacting
  the consumer's ability to process data safely. Note that the matrix-js-sdk can appear
  to be operating normally but be excluding or corrupting runtime data presented to
  the consumer. This issue has been fixed in matrix-js-sdk 19.4.0 and users are advised
  to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate this issue by redacting applicable
  events, waiting for the sync processor to store data, and restarting the client.
  Alternatively, redacting the applicable events and clearing all storage will often
  fix most perceived issues. In some cases, no workarounds are possible."
