title: "Downloads Resources over HTTP"
description: "co-cli-installer downloads the co-cli module as part of the install
  process, but does so over HTTP, which leaves it vulnerable to MITM attacks. It may
  be possible to cause remote code execution (RCE) by swapping out the requested resources
  with an attacker controlled copy if the attacker is on the network or positioned
  in between the user and the remote server."
