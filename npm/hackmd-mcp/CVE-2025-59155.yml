title: "HackMD MCP Server has Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability"
description: "A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability that affects all
  users running the HackMD MCP server in HTTP mode. Attackers could exploit this vulnerability
  by passing arbitrary `hackmdApiUrl` values through HTTP headers (`Hackmd-Api-Url`)
  or base64-encoded JSON query parameters. This allows malicious users to:\n\n- Redirect
  API calls to internal network services\n- Potentially access sensitive internal
  endpoints\n- Perform network reconnaissance through the server\n- Bypass network
  access controls\n\nThe vulnerability affects the HTTP transport mode specifically
  - stdio mode is not impacted as it only accepts requests from stdio."
