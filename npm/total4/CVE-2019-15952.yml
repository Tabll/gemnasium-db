title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "An issue was discovered in Total.js CMS 12.0.0. An authenticated user
  with the Pages privilege can conduct a path traversal attack (../) to include .html
  files that are outside the permitted directory. Also, if a page contains a template
  directive, then the directive will be server side processed. Thus, if a user can
  control the content of a .html file, then they can inject a payload with a malicious
  template directive to gain Remote Command Execution. The exploit will work only
  with the .html extension."
