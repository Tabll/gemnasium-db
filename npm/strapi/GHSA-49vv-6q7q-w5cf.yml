  is a duplicate of GHSA-9p2w-rmx4-9mw7. This link is maintained to preserve external

  is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in the Install and Uninstall Plugin components
  of the Admin panel, because it does not sanitize the plugin name, and attackers
  can inject arbitrary shell commands to be executed by the execa function."
