package_slug: "npm/strapi"
title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "Strapi is an open-source headless content management system. Prior to
  version 4.10.8, it is possible to leak private fields if one is using the `t(number)`
  prefix. Knex query allows users to change the default prefix. For example, if someone
  changes the prefix to be the same as it was before or to another table they want
  to query, the query changes from `password` to `t1.password`. `password` is protected
  by filtering protections but `t1.password` is not protected. This can lead to filtering
  attacks on everything related to the object again, including admin passwords and
  reset-tokens. Version 4.10.8 fixes this issue."
