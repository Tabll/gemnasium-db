description: "Vite provides frontend tooling. Prior to versions 2.9.16, 3.2.7, 4.0.5,
  4.1.5, 4.2.3, and 4.3.9, Vite Server Options (`server.fs.deny`) can be bypassed
  using double forward-slash (//) allows any unauthenticated user to read file from
  the Vite root-path of the application including the default `fs.deny` settings (`['.env',
  '.env.*', '*.{crt,pem}']`). Only users explicitly exposing the Vite dev server to
  the network (using `--host` or `server.host` config option) are affected, and only
  files in the immediate Vite project root folder could be exposed. This issue is
  fixed in vite@4.3.9, vite@4.2.3, vite@4.1.5, vite@4.0.5, vite@3.2.7, and vite@2.9.16."
