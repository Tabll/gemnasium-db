title: "Vite DOM Clobbering gadget found in vite bundled scripts that leads to XSS"
description: "We discovered a DOM Clobbering vulnerability in Vite when building scripts
  to `cjs`/`iife`/`umd` output format. The DOM Clobbering gadget in the module can
  lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) in web pages where scriptless attacker-controlled
  HTML elements (e.g., an img tag with an unsanitized name attribute) are present.\n\nNote
  that, we have identified similar security issues in Webpack: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/security/advisories/GHSA-4vvj-4cpr-p986"
