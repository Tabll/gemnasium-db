package_slug: "npm/gatsby-transformer-remark"
title: "gatsby-transformer-remark has possible unsanitized JavaScript code injection"
description: "### Impact\nThe gatsby-transformer-remark plugin prior to versions 5.25.1
  and 6.3.2 passes input through to the `gray-matter` npm package, which is vulnerable
  to JavaScript injection in its default configuration, unless input is sanitized.
  The vulnerability is present in gatsby-transformer-remark when passing input in
  data mode (querying MarkdownRemark nodes via GraphQL). Injected JavaScript executes
  in the context of the build server.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability untrusted/unsanitized
  input would need to be sourced by or added into a file processed by gatsby-transformer-remark.
  The following payload demonstrates a vulnerable configuration:\n```\n---js\n((require(\"child_process\")).execSync(\"id
  >> /tmp/rce\"))\n--- \n```\n\n### Patches\nA patch has been introduced in `gatsby-transformer-remark@5.25.1`
  and `gatsby-transformer-remark@6.3.2` which mitigates the issue by disabling the
  `gray-matter` JavaScript Frontmatter engine. The patch introduces a new option,
  `JSFrontmatterEngine` which is set to `false` by default. When setting `JSFrontmatterEngine`
  to `true`, input passed to `gatsby-plugin-mdx` must be sanitized before processing
  to avoid a security risk. Warnings are displayed when enabling `JSFrontmatterEngine`
  to `true` or if it appears that the MarkdownRemark input is attempting to use the
  Frontmatter engine.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf an older version of `gatsby-transformer-remark`
  must be used, input passed into the plugin should be sanitized ahead of processing.\n\n**We
  encourage projects to upgrade to the latest major release branch for all Gatsby
  plugins to ensure the latest security updates and bug fixes are received in a timely
  manner.**\n\n\n### For more information\nEmail us at [security@gatsbyjs.com](mailto:security@gatsbyjs.com)."
