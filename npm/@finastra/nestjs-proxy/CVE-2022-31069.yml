title: "Potential Authorization Header Exposure in NPM Packages @finastra/nestjs-proxy,
  @ffdc/nestjs-proxy"
description: "NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to
  version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library does not have a way to control when Authorization
  headers should should be forwarded for specific backend services configured by the
  application developer. This could have resulted in sensitive information such as
  OAuth bearer access tokens being inadvertently exposed to such services that should
  not see them. A new feature has been introduced in the patched version of nestjs-proxy
  that allows application developers to opt out of forwarding the Authorization headers
  on a per service basis using the `forwardToken` config setting. Developers are advised
  to review the README for this library on Github or NPM for further details on how
  this configuration can be applied. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of
  `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package
  has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such
  users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead."
