package_slug: "npm/@finastra/nestjs-proxy"
title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to
  version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library does not have a way to block sensitive cookies
  (e.g. session cookies) from being forwarded to backend services configured by the
  application developer. This could have led to sensitive cookies being inadvertently
  exposed to such services that should not see them. The patched version now blocks
  cookies from being forwarded by default. However developers can configure an allow-list
  of cookie names by using the `allowedCookies` config setting. This issue has been
  fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy`
  are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained
  or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`
  instead."
