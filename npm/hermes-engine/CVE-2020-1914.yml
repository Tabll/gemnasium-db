title: "Always-Incorrect Control Flow Implementation"
description: "A logic vulnerability when handling the SaveGeneratorLong instruction
  in Facebook Hermes prior to commit b2021df620824627f5a8c96615edbd1eb7fdddfc allows
  attackers to potentially read out-of-bounds or theoretically execute arbitrary code
  via crafted JavaScript. Note that this is only exploitable if the application using
  Hermes permits evaluation of untrusted JavaScript. Hence, most React Native applications
  are not affected."
