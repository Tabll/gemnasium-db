title: "Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types"
description: "An Integer signedness error in the JavaScript Interpreter in Facebook
  Hermes prior to commit 2c7af7ec481ceffd0d14ce2d7c045e475fd71dc6 allows attackers
  to cause a denial of service attack or a potential RCE via crafted JavaScript. Note
  that this is only exploitable if the application using Hermes permits evaluation
  of untrusted JavaScript. Hence, most React Native applications are not affected."
