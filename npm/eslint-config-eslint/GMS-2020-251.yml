description: " of `eslint-config-eslint` was published without authorization and was
  found to contain malicious code. This code would read the users `.npmrc` file and
  send any found authentication tokens to a remote server. The best course of action
  if you found this package installed in your environment is to revoke all your npm
  tokens. You can find instructions on how to do that here. https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/working_with_tokens#how-to-revoke-tokens\n"
