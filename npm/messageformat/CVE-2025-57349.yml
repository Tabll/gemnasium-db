package_slug: "npm/messageformat"
title: "messageformat has a prototype pollution vulnerability"
description: "The messageformat package, an implementation of the Unicode MessageFormat
  2 specification for JavaScript, is vulnerable to prototype pollution due to improper
  handling of message key paths in versions prior to 2.3.0. The flaw arises when processing
  nested message keys containing special characters (e.g., __proto__ ), which can
  lead to unintended modification of the JavaScript Object prototype. This vulnerability
  may allow a remote attacker to inject properties into the global object prototype
  via specially crafted message input, potentially causing denial of service or other
  undefined behaviors in applications using the affected component."
