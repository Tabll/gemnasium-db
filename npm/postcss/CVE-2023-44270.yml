title: "PostCSS line return parsing error"
description: "An issue was discovered in PostCSS before 8.4.31. It affects linters
  using PostCSS to parse external Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). There may be `\\r`
  discrepancies, as demonstrated by `@font-face{ font:(\\r/*);}` in a rule.\n\nThis
  vulnerability affects linters using PostCSS to parse external untrusted CSS. An
  attacker can prepare CSS in such a way that it will contains parts parsed by PostCSS
  as a CSS comment. After processing by PostCSS, it will be included in the PostCSS
  output in CSS nodes (rules, properties) despite being originally included in a comment."
