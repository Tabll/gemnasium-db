package_slug: "npm/@digitalbazaar/zcap"
title: "zcap has incomplete expiration checks in capability chains."
description: "When invoking a capability with a chain depth of 2, i.e., it is delegated
  directly from the root capability, the `expires` property is not properly checked
  against the current date or other `date` param.  This can allow invocations outside
  of the original intended time period.  A zcap still cannot be invoked without being
  able to use the associated private key material."
