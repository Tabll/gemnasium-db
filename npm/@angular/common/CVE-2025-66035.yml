title: "Angular is Vulnerable to XSRF Token Leakage via Protocol-Relative URLs in
  Angular HTTP Client"
description: "The vulnerability is a **Credential Leak by App Logic** that leads to
  the **unauthorized disclosure of the Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF) token** to
  an attacker-controlled domain.\n\nAngular's HttpClient has a built-in XSRF protection
  mechanism that works by checking if a request URL starts with a protocol (`http://`
  or `https://`) to determine if it is cross-origin. If the URL starts with protocol-relative
  URL (`//`), it is incorrectly treated as a same-origin request, and the XSRF token
  is automatically added to the `X-XSRF-TOKEN` header."
