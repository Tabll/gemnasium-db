title: "Angular has XSS Vulnerability via Unsanitized SVG Script Attributes"
description: "A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in the
  Angular Template Compiler. The vulnerability exists because Angular’s internal sanitization
  schema fails to recognize the `href` and `xlink:href` attributes of SVG `<script>`
  elements as a **Resource URL** context.\n\nIn a standard security model, attributes
  that can load and execute code (like a script's source) should be strictly validated.
  However, because the compiler does not classify these specific SVG attributes correctly,
  it allows attackers to bypass Angular's built-in security protections.\n\nWhen template
  binding is used to assign user-controlled data to these attributes for example,
  `<script [attr.href]=\"userInput\">` the compiler treats the value as a standard
  string or a non-sensitive URL rather than a resource link. This enables an attacker
  to provide a malicious payload, such as a `data:text/javascript` URI or a link to
  an external malicious script."
