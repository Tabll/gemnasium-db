title: "Angular Stored XSS Vulnerability via SVG Animation, SVG URL and MathML Attributes"
description: "A **Stored Cross-Site Scripting ([XSS](https://angular.dev/best-practices/security#preventing-cross-site-scripting-xss))**
  vulnerability has been identified in the **Angular Template Compiler**. It occurs
  because the compiler's internal security schema is incomplete, allowing attackers
  to bypass Angular's built-in security sanitization. Specifically, the schema fails
  to classify certain URL-holding attributes (e.g., those that could contain [`javascript:`
  URLs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Web/URI/Reference/Schemes/javascript))
  as requiring strict URL security, enabling the injection of malicious scripts.\n\nAdditionally,
  a related vulnerability exists involving SVG animation elements (`<animate>`, `<set>`,
  `<animateMotion>`, `<animateTransform>`). The `attributeName` attribute on these
  elements was not properly validated, allowing attackers to dynamically target security-sensitive
  attributes like `href` or `xlink:href` on other elements. By binding `attributeName`
  to \"href\" and providing a `javascript:` URL in the `values` or `to` attribute,
  an attacker could bypass sanitization and execute arbitrary code.\n\nAttributes
  confirmed to be vulnerable include:\n*   SVG-related attributes: (e.g., `xlink:href`),
  and various MathML attributes (e.g., `math|href`, `annotation|href`).\n*   SVG animation
  `attributeName` attribute when bound to \"href\" or \"xlink:href\".\n\nWhen template
  binding is used to assign untrusted, user-controlled data to these attributes (e.g.,
  `[attr.xlink:href]=\"maliciousURL\"` or `<animate [attributeName]=\"'href'\" [values]=\"maliciousURL\">`),
  the compiler incorrectly falls back to a non-sanitizing context or fails to block
  the dangerous attribute assignment. This allows an attacker to inject a `javascript:URL`
  payload. Upon user interaction (like a click) on the element, or automatically in
  the case of animations, the malicious JavaScript executes in the context of the
  application's origin."
