title: "Angular SSR has a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) flaw"
description: "The vulnerability is a **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** flaw within
  the URL resolution mechanism of Angular's Server-Side Rendering package (`@angular/ssr`).\n\nThe
  function `createRequestUrl` uses the native `URL` constructor. When an incoming
  request path (e.g., `originalUrl` or `url`) begins with a **double forward slash
  (`//`) or backslash (`\\\\`)**, the `URL` constructor treats it as a **schema-relative
  URL**. This behavior overrides the security-intended base URL (protocol, host, and
  port) supplied as the second argument, instead resolving the URL against the scheme
  of the base URL but adopting the attacker-controlled hostname.\n\nThis allows an
  attacker to specify an external domain in the URL path, tricking the Angular SSR
  environment into setting the page's virtual location (accessible via `DOCUMENT`
  or `PlatformLocation` tokens) to this attacker-controlled domain. Any subsequent
  **relative HTTP requests** made during the SSR process (e.g., using `HttpClient.get('assets/data.json')`)
  will be incorrectly resolved against the attacker's domain, forcing the server to
  communicate with an arbitrary external endpoint."
