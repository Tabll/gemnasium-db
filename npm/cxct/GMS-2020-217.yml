description: "All versions of `cxct` contain malicious code. The package finds and
  exfiltrates cryptocurrency wallets. Any computer that has this package installed
  or running should be considered fully compromised. All secrets and keys stored on
  that computer should be rotated immediately from a different computer.\n\nThe package
  should be removed, but as full control of the computer may have been given to an
  outside entity, there is no guarantee that removing the package will remove all
  malicious software resulting from installing it."
