title: "Fabric.js Affected by Stored XSS via SVG Export"
description: "fabric.js applies `escapeXml()` to text content during SVG export (`src/shapes/Text/TextSVGExportMixin.ts:186`)
  but fails to apply it to other user-controlled string values that are interpolated
  into SVG attribute markup. When attacker-controlled JSON is loaded via `loadFromJSON()`
  and later exported via `toSVG()`, the unescaped values break out of XML attributes
  and inject arbitrary SVG elements including event handlers."
