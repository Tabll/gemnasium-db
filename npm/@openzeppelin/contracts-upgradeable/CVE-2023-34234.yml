title: "OpenZeppelin Contracts's governor proposal creation may be blocked by frontrunning"
description: " OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for smart contract development.
  By frontrunning the creation of a proposal, an attacker can become the proposer
  and gain the ability to cancel it. The attacker can do this repeatedly to try to
  prevent a proposal from being proposed at all. This impacts the `Governor` contract
  in v4.9.0 only, and the `GovernorCompatibilityBravo` contract since v4.3.0. This
  problem has been patched in 4.9.1 by introducing opt-in frontrunning protection.
  Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may submit the proposal creation
  transaction to an endpoint with frontrunning protection as a workaround."
