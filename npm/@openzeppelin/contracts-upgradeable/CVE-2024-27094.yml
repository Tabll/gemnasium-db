title: "OpenZeppelin Contracts base64 encoding may read from potentially dirty memory"
description: "### Impact\n\nThe `Base64.encode` function encodes a `bytes` input by
  iterating over it in chunks of 3 bytes. When this input is not a multiple of 3,
  the last iteration may read parts of the memory that are beyond the input buffer.\n\nAlthough
  the `encode` function pads the output for these cases, up to 4 bits of data are
  kept between the encoding and padding, corrupting the output if these bits were
  dirty (i.e. memory after the input is not 0). These conditions are more frequent
  in the following scenarios:\n\n- A `bytes memory` struct is allocated just after
  the input and the first bytes of it are non-zero.\n- The memory pointer is set to
  a non-empty memory location before allocating the input.\n\nDevelopers should evaluate
  whether the extra bits can be maliciously manipulated by an attacker.\n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrade
  to 5.0.2 or 4.9.6.\n\n### References\n\nThis issue was reported by the Independent
  Security Researcher Riley Holterhus through Immunefi (@rileyholterhus on X)"
