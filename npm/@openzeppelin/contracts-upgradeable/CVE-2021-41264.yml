package_slug: "npm/@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable"
title: "Improper Initialization"
description: "OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for smart contract development.
  In affected versions upgradeable contracts using `UUPSUpgradeable` may be vulnerable
  to an attack affecting uninitialized implementation contracts. A fix is included
  in version 4.3.2 of `@openzeppelin/contracts` and `@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable`.
  For users unable to upgrade; initialize implementation contracts using `UUPSUpgradeable`
  by invoking the initializer function (usually called `initialize`). An example is
  provided [in the forum](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/security-advisory-initialize-uups-implementation-contracts/15301)."
