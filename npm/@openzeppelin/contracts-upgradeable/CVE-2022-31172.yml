package_slug: "npm/@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for smart contract development.
  Versions 4.1.0 until 4.7.1 is vulnerable to the SignatureChecker reverting. `SignatureChecker.isValidSignatureNow`
  is not expected to revert. However, an incorrect assumption about Solidity 0.8's
  `abi.decode` allows some cases to revert, given a target contract that does not
  implement EIP-1271 as expected. The contracts that may be affected are those that
  use `SignatureChecker` to check the validity of a signature and handle invalid signatures
  in a way other than reverting. The issue was patched in version 4.7.1."
