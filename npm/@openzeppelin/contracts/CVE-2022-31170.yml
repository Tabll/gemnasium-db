title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for smart contract development.
  Versions 4.0.0 until 4.7.1 is vulnerable to ERC165Checker reverting instead of returning
  `false`. `ERC165Checker.supportsInterface` is designed to always successfully return
  a boolean, and under no circumstance revert. However, an incorrect assumption about
  Solidity 0.8's `abi.decode` allows some cases to revert, given a target contract
  that does not implement EIP-165 as expected, specifically if it returns a value
  other than 0 or 1. The contracts that may be affected are those that use `ERC165Checker`
  to check for support for an interface and then handle the lack of support in a way
  other than reverting. The issue was patched in version 4.7.1."
