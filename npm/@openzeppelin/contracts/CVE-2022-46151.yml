title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "Querybook is an open source data querying UI. In affected versions user
  provided data is not escaped in the error field of the auth callback url in 
  `querybook/server/app/auth/oauth_auth.py` and `querybook/server/app/auth/okta_auth.py`. 
  This may allow attackers to perform reflected cross site scripting (XSS) if Content 
  Security Policy (CSP) is not enabled or `unsafe-inline` is allowed. Users are advised 
  to upgrade to the latest, patched version of querybook (version 3.14.2 or greater). 
  Users unable to upgrade may enable CSP and not allow unsafe-inline or manually 
  escape query parameters in a reverse proxy."
