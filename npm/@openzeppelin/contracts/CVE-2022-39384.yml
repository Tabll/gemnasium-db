title: "Improper Initialization"
description: "OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development.
  Before version 4.4.1 but after 3.2.0, initializer functions that are invoked separate
  from contract creation (the most prominent example being minimal proxies) may be
  reentered if they make an untrusted non-view external call. Once an initializer
  has finished running it can never be re-executed. However, an exception put in place
  to support multiple inheritance made reentrancy possible in the scenario described
  above, breaking the expectation that there is a single execution. Note that upgradeable
  proxies are commonly initialized together with contract creation, where reentrancy
  is not feasible, so the impact of this issue is believed to be minor. This issue
  has been patched, please upgrade to version 4.4.1. As a workaround, avoid untrusted
  external calls during initialization."
