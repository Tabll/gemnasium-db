title: "Improper Validation of Integrity Check Value"
description: "OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for smart contract development.
  Starting in version 4.7.0 and prior to version 4.9.2, when the `verifyMultiProof`,
  `verifyMultiProofCalldata`, `procesprocessMultiProof`, or `processMultiProofCalldat`
  functions are in use, it is possible to construct merkle trees that allow forging
  a valid multiproof for an arbitrary set of leaves.\n\nA contract may be vulnerable
  if it uses multiproofs for verification and the merkle tree that is processed includes
  a node with value 0 at depth 1 (just under the root). This could happen inadvertedly
  for balanced trees with 3 leaves or less, if the leaves are not hashed. This could
  happen deliberately if a malicious tree builder includes such a node in the tree.\n\nA
  contract is not vulnerable if it uses single-leaf proving (`verify`, `verifyCalldata`,
  `processProof`, or `processProofCalldata`), or if it uses multiproofs with a known
  tree that has hashed leaves. Standard merkle trees produced or validated with the
  @openzeppelin/merkle-tree library are safe.\n\nThe problem has been patched in version
  4.9.2.\n\nSome workarounds are available. For those using multiproofs: When constructing
  merkle trees hash the leaves and do not insert empty nodes in your trees. Using
  the @openzeppelin/merkle-tree package eliminates this issue. Do not accept user-provided
  merkle roots without reconstructing at least the first level of the tree. Verify
  the merkle tree structure by reconstructing it from the leaves."
