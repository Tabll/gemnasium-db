title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development.
  The target contract of an EIP-165 `supportsInterface` query can cause unbounded
  gas consumption by returning a lot of data, while it is generally assumed that this
  operation has a bounded cost. The issue has been fixed in v4.7.2. Users are advised
  to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue."
