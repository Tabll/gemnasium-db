title: "Improper Validation of Integrity Check Value"
description: "OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development.
  The functions `ECDSA.recover` and `ECDSA.tryRecover` is vulnerable to a kind of
  signature malleability due to accepting EIP-2098 compact signatures in addition
  to the traditional 65 byte signature format. This is only an issue for the functions
  that take a single `bytes` argument, and not the functions that take `r, v, s` or
  `r, vs` as separate arguments. The potentially affected contracts are those that
  implement signature reuse or replay protection by marking the signature itself as
  used rather than the signed message or a nonce included in it. A user may take a
  signature that has already been submitted, submit it again in a different form,
  and bypass this protection. The issue has been patched in 4.7.3."
