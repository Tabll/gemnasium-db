package_slug: "npm/@openzeppelin/contracts"
title: "Improper Initialization"
description: "In OpenZeppelin <=v4.4.0, initializer functions that are invoked separate
  from contract creation (the most prominent example being minimal proxies) may be
  reentered if they make an untrusted non-view external call. Once an initializer
  has finished running it can never be re-executed. However, an exception put in place
  to support multiple inheritance made reentrancy possible, breaking the expectation
  that there is a single execution."
