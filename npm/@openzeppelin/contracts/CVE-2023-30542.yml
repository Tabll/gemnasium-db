package_slug: "npm/@openzeppelin/contracts"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development.
  The proposal creation entrypoint (`propose`) in `GovernorCompatibilityBravo` allows
  the creation of proposals with a `signatures` array shorter than the `calldatas`
  array. This causes the additional elements of the latter to be ignored, and if the
  proposal succeeds the corresponding actions would eventually execute without any
  calldata. The `ProposalCreated` event correctly represents what will eventually
  execute, but the proposal parameters as queried through `getActions` appear to respect
  the original intended calldata. This issue has been patched in 4.8.3. As a workaround,
  ensure that all proposals that pass through governance have equal length `signatures`
  and `calldatas` parameters."
