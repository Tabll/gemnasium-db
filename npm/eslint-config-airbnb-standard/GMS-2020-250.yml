title: "Malicious Package"
description: " of `eslint-config-airbnb-standard` was published with a bundled version
  of `eslint-scope` that was found to contain malicious code. This code would read
  the users `.npmrc` file and send it's contents to a remote server. The best course
  of action if you found this package installed in your environment is to revoke all
  your npm tokens and use a different version of the module. You can find instructions
  on how to do that here. https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/working_with_tokens#how-to-revoke-tokens\n"
