title: "CediPay Affected by Improper Input Validation in Payment Processing"
description: "A vulnerability in CediPay allows attackers to bypass input validation
  in the transaction API.\n\nAffected users: All deployments running versions prior
  to the patched release.\n\nRisk: Exploitation could result in unauthorized transactions,
  exposure of sensitive financial data, and compromise of payment integrity.\n\nSeverity:
  High — potential financial loss and reputational damage.\n\nPatches\nThe issue has
  been fixed in version 1.2.3.\n\nUsers should upgrade to 1.2.3 or later immediately.\n\nAll
  versions earlier than 1.2.3 remain vulnerable.\n\nWorkarounds\nIf upgrading is not
  immediately possible:\n\nRestrict API access to trusted networks or IP ranges.\n\nEnforce
  strict input validation at the application layer.\n\nMonitor transaction logs for
  anomalies or suspicious activity.\n\nThese mitigations reduce exposure but do not
  fully eliminate the vulnerability.\n\nReferences\nOWASP Input Validation Guidelines
