title: "CouchAuth host header injection vulnerability leaks the password reset token"
description: "A host header injection vulnerability exists in the NPM package @perfood/couch-auth
  versions <= 0.20.0. By sending a specially crafted host header in the forgot password
  request, it is possible to send password reset links to users which, once clicked,
  lead to an attacker-controlled server and thus leak the password reset token. This
  may allow an attacker to reset other users' passwords and take over their accounts."
