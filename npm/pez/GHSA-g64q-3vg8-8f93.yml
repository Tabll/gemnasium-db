title: "Prototype Pollution in pez"
description: "All versions of `pez` are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. A multipart
  payload can be constructed in a way that one of the parts’ content can be set as
  the entire payload object’s prototype. If this prototype contains data, it may bypass
  other validation rules which enforce access and privacy. If this prototype evaluates
  to null, it can cause unhandled exceptions when the request payload is accessed."
