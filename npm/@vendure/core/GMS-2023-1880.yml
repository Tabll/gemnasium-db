title: "Vendure Cross Site Request Forgery vulnerability impacting all API requests"
description: "### Impact\nVendure is an e-commerce GraphQL framework with a number
  of APIs and different levels of\nauthorization. By default the Cookie settings are
  insecure, having the SameSite setting as false\nwhich results in not having one
  (originates from the cookie-session npm packageâ€™s default\nsettings).\n\n### Patches\nIn
  progress\n\n### Workarounds\nManually set the `authOptions.cookieOptions.sameSite`
  configuration option to `'strict'`, `'lax'` or `true`.\n\n### References\n_Are there
  any links users can visit to find out more?_\n"
