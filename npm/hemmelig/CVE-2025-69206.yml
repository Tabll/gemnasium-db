title: "hemmelig allows SSRF Filter bypass via Secret Request functionality"
description: "A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) filter bypass vulnerability exists
  in the webhook URL validation of the Secret Requests feature. The application attempts
  to block internal/private IP addresses but can be bypassed using DNS rebinding (e.g.,
  `localtest.me` which resolves to `127.0.0.1`) or open redirect services (e.g., `httpbin.org/redirect-to`).
  This allows an authenticated user to make the server initiate HTTP requests to internal
  network resources."
