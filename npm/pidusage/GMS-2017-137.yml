package_slug: "npm/pidusage"
title: "Command Injection"
description: "The pidusage module passes unsanitized input to child_process.exec,
  resulting in command injection in the ps method, as the pid is never cast to an
  integer as the comment expects. This module is vulnerable to this PoC on Darwin,
  SunOS, FreeBSD, and AIX. Windows and Linux are not vulnerable."

  data to the stat function, ensure that the data is sanitized using a proper shell
  escaping library. Note that Windows and Linux are not vulnerable."
