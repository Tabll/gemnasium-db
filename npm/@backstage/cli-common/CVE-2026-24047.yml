title: "@backstage/cli-common has a possible `resolveSafeChildPath` Symlink Chain
  Bypass"
description: "The `resolveSafeChildPath` utility function in `@backstage/backend-plugin-api`,
  which is used to prevent path traversal attacks, failed to properly validate symlink
  chains and dangling symlinks. An attacker could bypass the path validation by:\n\n1.
  **Symlink chains**: Creating `link1 → link2 → /outside` where intermediate symlinks
  eventually resolve outside the allowed directory\n2. **Dangling symlinks**: Creating
  symlinks pointing to non-existent paths outside the base directory, which would
  later be created during file operations\n\nThis function is used by Scaffolder actions
  and other backend components to ensure file operations stay within designated directories."
