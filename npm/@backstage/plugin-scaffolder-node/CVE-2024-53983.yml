title: "Backstage Scaffolder plugin vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery"
description: "A vulnerability is identified in Backstage Scaffolder template functionality
  where Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) can be exploited to perform Git config
  injection. The vulnerability allows an attacker to capture privileged git tokens

  to sensitive resources in git can be achieved. The impact is considered medium severity
  as the Backstage Threat Model recommends restricting access to adding and editing
  templates in the Backstage Catalog plugin."
