title: "Backstage has a Possible Symlink Path Traversal in Scaffolder Actions"
description: "Multiple Scaffolder actions and archive extraction utilities were vulnerable
  to symlink-based path traversal attacks. An attacker with access to create and execute
  Scaffolder templates could exploit symlinks to:\n\n1. **Read arbitrary files** via
  the `debug:log` action by creating a symlink pointing to sensitive files (e.g.,
  `/etc/passwd`, configuration files, secrets)\n2. **Delete arbitrary files** via
  the `fs:delete` action by creating symlinks pointing outside the workspace\n3. **Write
  files outside the workspace** via archive extraction (tar/zip) containing malicious
  symlinks\n\nThis affects any Backstage deployment where users can create or execute
  Scaffolder templates."
