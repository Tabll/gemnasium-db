package_slug: "npm/@backstage/plugin-app-backend"
title: "Unexpected visibility of environment variable configurations in @backstage/plugin-app-backend"
description: "Configuration supplied through `APP_CONFIG_*` environment variables,
  for example `APP_CONFIG_backend_listen_port=7007`, where unexpectedly ignoring the
  visibility defined in configuration schema. This occurred even if the configuration
  schema specified that they should have backend or secret visibility. This was an
  intended feature of the `APP_CONFIG_*` way of supplying configuration, but now clearly
  goes against the expected behavior of the configuration system. This behavior leads
  to a risk of potentially exposing sensitive configuration details intended to remain
  private or restricted to backend processes."
