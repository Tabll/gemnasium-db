title: "Backstage has a Possible SSRF when reading from allowed URL's in `backend.reading.allow`"
description: "The `FetchUrlReader` component, used by the catalog and other plugins
  to fetch content from URLs, followed HTTP redirects automatically. This allowed
  an attacker who controls a host listed in `backend.reading.allow` to redirect requests
  to internal or sensitive URLs that are not on the allowlist, bypassing the URL allowlist
  security control.\n\nThis is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability
  that could allow access to internal resources, but it does not allow attackers to
  include additional request headers."
