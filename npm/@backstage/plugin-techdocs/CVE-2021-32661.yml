package_slug: "npm/@backstage/plugin-techdocs"
title: "Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type"
description: "Backstage is an open platform for building developer portals. In versions
  of Backstage's Techdocs Plugin (`@backstage/plugin-techdocs`), a malicious internal
  actor can potentially upload documentation content with malicious scripts by embedding
  the script within an `object` element. This may give access to sensitive data when
  other users visit that same documentation page. The ability to upload malicious
  content may be limited by internal code review processes, unless the chosen TechDocs
  deployment method is to use an object store and the actor has access to upload files
  directly to that store. The vulnerability is patched in the `0.9.5` release of `@backstage/plugin-techdocs`."
