package_slug: "npm/@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend"
title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "Backstage is an open platform for building developer portals. The attack
  is executed by crafting a custom Scaffolder template with a `github:publish:pull-request`
  action and a particular source path. When the template is executed the sensitive
  files would be included in the published pull request. This vulnerability is mitigated
  by the fact that an attacker would need access to create and register templates
  in the Backstage catalog, and that the attack is very visible given that the exfiltration
  happens via a pull request. The vulnerability is patched in the `0.15.9` release
  of `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend`."
