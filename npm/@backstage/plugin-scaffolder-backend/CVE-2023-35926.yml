package_slug: "npm/@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend"
title: "Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')"
description: "Backstage is an open platform for building developer portals. The Backstage
  scaffolder-backend plugin uses a templating library that requires sandbox, as it
  by design allows for code injection. The library used for this sandbox so far has
  been `vm2`, but in light of several past vulnerabilities and existing vulnerabilities
  that may not have a fix, the plugin has switched to using a different sandbox library.
  A malicious actor with write access to a registered scaffolder template could manipulate
  the template in a way that allows for remote code execution on the scaffolder-backend
  instance. This was only exploitable in the template YAML definition itself and not
  by user input data. This is vulnerability is fixed in version 1.15.0 of `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend`."
