- "CVE-2021-32660"
package_slug: "npm/@backstage/techdocs-common"
title: "Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type"
description: "Backstage is an open platform for building developer portals, and techdocs-common
  contains common functionalities for Backstage's TechDocs. In versions of `@backstage/tehdocs-common`
  prior to 0.6.4, a malicious internal actor is able to upload documentation content
  with malicious scripts. These scripts would normally be sanitized by the TechDocs
  frontend, but by tricking a user to visit the content via the TechDocs API, the
  content sanitazion will be bypassed. If the TechDocs API is hosted on the same origin
  as the Backstage app or other backend plugins, this may give access to sensitive
  data. The ability to upload malicious content may be limited by internal code review
  processes, unless the chosen TechDocs deployment method is to use an object store
  and the actor has access to upload files directly to that store. The vulnerability
  is patched in the `0.6.4` release of `@backstage/techdocs-common`."
