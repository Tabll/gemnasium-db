package_slug: "npm/@backstage/core-components"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "Backstage is an open platform for building developer portals. `@backstage/catalog-model`
  prior to version 1.2.0, `@backstage/core-components` prior to 0.12.4, and `@backstage/plugin-catalog-backend`
  prior to 1.7.2 are affected by a cross-site scripting vulnerability. This vulnerability
  allows a malicious actor with access to add or modify content in an instance of
  the Backstage software catalog to inject script URLs in the entities stored in the
  catalog. If users of the catalog then click on said URLs, that can lead to an XSS
  attack. This vulnerability has been patched in both the frontend and backend implementations.
  The default `Link` component from `@backstage/core-components` version 1.2.0 and
  greater will now reject `javascript:` URLs, and there is a global override of `window.open`
  to do the same. In addition, the catalog model v0.12.4 and greater as well as the
  catalog backend v1.7.2 and greater now has additional validation built in that prevents
  `javascript:` URLs in known annotations. As a workaround, the general practice of
  limiting access to modifying catalog content and requiring code reviews greatly
  help mitigate this vulnerability."
