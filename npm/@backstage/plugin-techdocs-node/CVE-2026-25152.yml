title: "@backstage/plugin-techdocs-node vulnerable to possible Path Traversal in TechDocs
  Local Generator"
description: "A path traversal vulnerability in the TechDocs local generator allows
  attackers to read arbitrary files from the host filesystem when Backstage is configured
  with `techdocs.generator.runIn: local`.\n\nWhen processing documentation from untrusted
  sources, symlinks within the docs directory are followed by MkDocs during the build
  process. File contents are embedded into generated HTML and exposed to users who
  can view the documentation."
