package_slug: "npm/libp2p"
title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "js-libp2p is the official javascript Implementation of libp2p networking
  stack. Versions older than `v0.38.0` of js-libp2p is vulnerable to targeted resource
  exhaustion attacks. These attacks target libp2p’s connection, stream, peer, and
  memory management. An attacker can cause the allocation of large amounts of memory,
  ultimately leading to the process getting killed by the host’s operating system.
  While a connection manager tasked with keeping the number of connections within
  manageable limits has been part of js-libp2p, this component was designed to handle
  the regular churn of peers, not a targeted resource exhaustion attack. Users are
  advised to update their js-libp2p dependency to `v0.38.0` or greater. There are
  no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
