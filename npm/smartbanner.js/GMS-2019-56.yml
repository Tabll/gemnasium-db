title: "Low severity vulnerability that affects smartbanner.js"
description: "## rel noopener vulnerability\n\n### Impact\nClicking on smartbanner
  _View_ link and navigating to 3rd party page leaves `window.opener` exposed. It
  may allow hostile 3rd parties to abuse `window.opener`, e.g. by redirection or injection
  on the original page with smartbanner.\n\n### Patches\n`rel=\"noopener\"` is automatically
  populated to links as of `v1.14.1` which is a recommended upgrade to resolve the
  vulnerability.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf you can not upgrade to `v1.14.1`:\n1. Ensure
  _View_ link is only taking users to App Store or Google Play Store where security
  is guarded by respective app store security teams\n2. If _View_ link is going to
  a 3rd party page, limit smartbanner.js to be used on iOS that decreases the scope
  of the vulnerability since as of Safari, `rel=\"noopener\"` is imposed on all `target=\"_blank\"`
  links.\n\n Following combination of smartbanner meta tags can be used to achieve
  the above:\n\n ```html\n <meta name=\"smartbanner:enabled-platforms\" content=\"none\">\n
  <meta name=\"smartbanner:include-user-agent-regex\" content=\"Mobile.*Safari\">\n
  ```\n\n### References\n* [About rel=noopener](https://mathiasbynens.github.io/rel-noopener/)\n*
