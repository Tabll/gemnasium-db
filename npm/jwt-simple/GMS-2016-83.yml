description: "\"algorithm\" isn't enforced in jwt.decode() and a malicious user could
  choose what algorithm is sent sent to the server. If the server is expecting RSA
  but is sent HMAC-SHA with RSA's public key, the server will think the public key
  is actually an HMAC private key. This could be used to forge any data an attacker
  wants."
