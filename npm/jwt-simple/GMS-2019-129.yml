title: "Signature Verification Bypass in jwt-simple"
description: "Versions of `jwt-simple` prior to 0.5.3 are vulnerable to Signature
  Verification Bypass. If no algorithm is specified in the `decode()` function, the
  packages uses the algorithm in the JWT to decode tokens. This allows an attacker
  to create a HS256 (symmetric algorithm) JWT with the server's public key as secret,
  and the package will verify it as HS256 instead of RS256 (asymmetric algorithm).\n\n\n##
  Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 0.5.3 or later."
