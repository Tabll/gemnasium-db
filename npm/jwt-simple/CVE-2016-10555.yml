package_slug: "npm/jwt-simple"
title: "Forgeable Public/Private Tokens in jwt-simple"
description: "Since \"algorithm\" isn't enforced in jwt.decode()in jwt-simple 0.3.0
  and earlier, a malicious user could choose what algorithm is sent sent to the server.
  If the server is expecting RSA but is sent HMAC-SHA with RSA's public key, the server
  will think the public key is actually an HMAC private key. This could be used to
  forge any data an attacker wants."
