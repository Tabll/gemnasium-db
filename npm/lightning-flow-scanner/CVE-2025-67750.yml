title: "Lightning Flow Scanner Vulnerable to Code Injection via Unsafe Use of `new
  Function()` in APIVersion Rule"
description: "The APIVersion rule uses `new Function()` to evaluate expression strings.
  A malicious crafted flow metadata file can cause arbitrary JavaScript execution
  during scanning. An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript during a scan by
  supplying a malicious expression within rule configuration or crafted flow metadata.
  This could compromise developer machines, CI runners, or editor environments."
