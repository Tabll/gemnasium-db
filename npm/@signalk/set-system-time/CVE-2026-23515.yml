title: "Signal K set-system-time plugin vulnerable to RCE - Command Injection"
description: "A Command Injection vulnerability allows authenticated users with write
  permissions to execute arbitrary shell commands on the Signal K server when the
  set-system-time plugin is enabled. Unauthenticated users can also exploit this vulnerability
  if security is disabled on the Signal K server. This occurs due to unsafe construction
  of shell commands when processing `navigation.datetime` values received via WebSocket
  delta messages."
