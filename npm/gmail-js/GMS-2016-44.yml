description: "Three functions exposed by the Gmail.js API (not the Google Gmail API)
  are vulnerable to DOM-based cross site scripting. The three functions are `tools.parse_response`,
  `helper.get.visible_emails_post`, and `helper.get.email_data_post`. Each one of
  these functions calls `new Function()` with user data passed as the argument."
