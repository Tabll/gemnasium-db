title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream
  Component ('Injection')"
description: "cruddl is software for creating a GraphQL API for a database, using
  the GraphQL SDL to model a schema. If cruddl starting with version 1.1.0 and prior
  to versions 2.7.0 and 3.0.2 is used to generate a schema that uses `@flexSearchFulltext`,
  users of that schema may be able to inject arbitrary AQL queries that will be forwarded
  to and executed by ArangoDB. Schemas that do not use `@flexSearchFulltext` are not
  affected. The attacker needs to have `READ` permission to at least one root entity
  type that has `@flexSearchFulltext` enabled. The issue has been fixed in version
  3.0.2 and in version 2.7.0 of cruddl. As a workaround, users can temporarily remove
  `@flexSearchFulltext` from their schemas."
