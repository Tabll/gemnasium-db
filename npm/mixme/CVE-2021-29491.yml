package_slug: "npm/mixme"
title: "Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources"

  the `mutate()` and `merge()` functions. The polluted attribute will be directly assigned
  to every object in the program. This will put the availability of the program at
  risk causing a potential denial of service (DoS)."
