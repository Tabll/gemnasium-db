identifier: "CVE-2021-21298"
package_slug: "npm/node-red"
title: "Path Traversal"
description: "Node-Red is a low-code programming for event-driven applications built
  using nodejs. Node-RED has a vulnerability which allows arbitrary path traversal
  via the Projects API. If the Projects feature is enabled, a user with `projects.read`
  permission is able to access any file via the Projects API. The vulnerability applies 
  only to the Projects feature which is not enabled by default in Node-RED. The 
  primary workaround is not give untrusted users read access to the Node-RED editor."
