description: "Node-Red is a low-code programming for event-driven applications built
  using nodejs. Node-RED contains a Prototype Pollution vulnerability in the admin
  API. A badly formed request can modify the prototype of the default JavaScript Object
  with the potential to affect the default behaviour of the Node-RED runtime. The
