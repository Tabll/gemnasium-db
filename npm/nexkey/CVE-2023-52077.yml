description: "Nexkey is a lightweight fork of Misskey v12 optimized for small to medium
  size servers. Prior to 12.23Q4.5, Nexkey allows external apps using tokens issued
  by administrators and moderators to call admin APIs. This allows malicious third-party
  apps to perform operations such as updating server settings, as well as compromise
  object storage and email server credentials. This issue has been patched in 12.23Q4.5."
