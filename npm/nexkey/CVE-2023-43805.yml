package_slug: "npm/nexkey"
title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "Nexkey is a fork of Misskey, an open source, decentralized social media
  platform. Prior to version 12.121.9, incomplete URL validation can allow users to
  bypass authentication for access to the job queue dashboard. Version 12.121.9 contains
  a fix for this issue. As a workaround, it may be possible to avoid this by blocking
  access using tools such as Cloudflare's WAF."
