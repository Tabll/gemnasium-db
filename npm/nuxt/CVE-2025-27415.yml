title: "Nuxt allows DOS via cache poisoning with payload rendering response"
description: "By sending a crafted HTTP request to a server behind an CDN, it is possible
  in some circumstances to poison the CDN cache and highly impacts the availability
  of a site.\n\nIt is possible to craft a request, such as `https://mysite.com/?/_payload.json`
  which will be rendered as JSON. If the CDN in front of a Nuxt site ignores the query
  string when determining whether to cache a route, then this JSON response could
  be served to future visitors to the site."
