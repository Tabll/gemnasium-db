title: "Malware in pre-build binaries of bignum"
description: "### Impact\n\nbignum releases from v0.12.2 to v0.13.0 (inclusive) used
  node-pre-gyp to optionally download pre-built binary versions of the addon. These
  binaries were published on a now-expired S3 bucket which has since been claimed
  by a malicious third party which is now serving binaries containing malware that
  exfiltrates data from the user's computer.\n\n### Patches\n\nv0.13.1 does not use
  node-pre-gyp and does not have support for downloading pre-built binaries in any
  form, avoiding the risk of malicious downloads."
