title: "Forgeable Public/Private Tokens"
description: "Since \"algorithm\" isn't enforced in `jws.verify()`, a malicious user
  could choose what algorithm is sent to the server. If the server is expecting RSA
  but is sent HMAC-SHA with RSA's public key, the server will think the public key
  is actually an HMAC private key. This could be used to forge any data an attacker
  wants."
