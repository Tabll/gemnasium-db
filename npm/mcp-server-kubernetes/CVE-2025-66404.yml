identifiers:
- "CVE-2025-66404"
- "GHSA-wvxp-jp4w-w8wg"
package_slug: "npm/mcp-server-kubernetes"
title: "mcp-server-kubernetes has potential security issue in exec_in_pod tool"
description: "A security issue exists in the `exec_in_pod` tool of the `mcp-server-kubernetes`
  MCP Server. The tool accepts user-provided commands in both array and string formats.
  When a string format is provided, it is passed directly to shell interpretation
  (`sh -c`) without input validation, allowing shell metacharacters to be interpreted.
  This vulnerability can be exploited through direct command injection or indirect
  prompt injection attacks, where AI agents may execute commands without explicit
  user intent."
