package_slug: "npm/mcp-server-kubernetes"
title: "MCP Server Kubernetes vulnerable to command injection in several tools"
description: "A command injection vulnerability exists in the `mcp-server-kubernetes`
  MCP Server. The vulnerability is caused by the unsanitized use of input parameters
  within a call to `child_process.execSync`, enabling an attacker to inject arbitrary
  system commands. Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution under
  the server process's privileges.\n\nThe server constructs and executes shell commands
  using unvalidated user input directly within command-line strings. This introduces
  the possibility of shell metacharacter injection (`|`, `>`, `&&`, etc.)."
