title: "vue-i18n's escapeParameterHtml does not prevent DOM-based XSS through its
  tag attributes"
description: "The escapeParameterHtml: true option in Vue I18n is designed to protect
  against HTML/script injection by escaping interpolated parameters. However, this
  setting fails to prevent execution of certain tag-based payloads, such as <img src=x
  onerror=...>, if the interpolated value is inserted inside an HTML context using
  v-html.\n\nThis may lead to a DOM-based XSS vulnerability, even when using escapeParameterHtml:
  true, if a translation string includes minor HTML and is rendered via v-html."
