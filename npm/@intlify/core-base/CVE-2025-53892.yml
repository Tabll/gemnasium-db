title: "vue-i18n's escapeParameterHtml does not prevent DOM-based XSS through its
  tag attributes"
description: "The escapeParameterHtml: true option in Vue I18n is designed to protect
  against HTML/script injection by escaping interpolated parameters. However, this
  setting fails to prevent execution of certain tag-based payloads, such as `<img
  src=x onerror=...>`, if the interpolated value is inserted inside an HTML context
  using v-html.\n\nThis may lead to a DOM-based XSS vulnerability, even when using
  escapeParameterHtml: true, if a translation string includes minor HTML and is rendered
  via v-html."
