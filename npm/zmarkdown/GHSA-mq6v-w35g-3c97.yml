title: "Local File Inclusion vulnerability in zmarkdown"
description: "A minor Local File Inclusion vulnerability has been found in\n`zmarkdown`,
  which allowed for images with a known path on\nthe host machine to be included inside
  a LaTeX document.\n\nTo prevent it, a new option has been created that allow to
  replace\ninvalid paths with a default image instead of linking the image on the\nhost
  directly. `zmarkdown` has been updated to make this setting the\ndefault.\n\nEvery
  user of `zmarkdown` is likely impacted, except if\ndisabling LaTeX generation or
  images download. Here\nis an example of including an image from an invalid path:\n\n```markdown\n![](/tmp/img.png)\n```\n\nWill
  effectively redownload and include the image\nfound at `/tmp/img.png`."
