title: "Directory Traversal in ltt.js"
description: "Affected versions of `ltt.js` resolve relative file paths, resulting
  in a directory traversal vulnerability. A malicious actor can use this vulnerability
  to access files outside of the intended directory root, which may result in the
  disclosure of private files on the vulnerable system.\n\nExample request:\n```\nGET
  /../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1\nhost:foo\n``` No patch is available
  for this vulnerability.\n\nIt is recommended that the package is only used for local
  development, and if the functionality is needed for production, a different package
  is used instead."
