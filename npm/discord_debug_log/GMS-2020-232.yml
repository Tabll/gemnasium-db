description: "All versions of `discord_debug_log` contain obfuscated malware that
  uploads Discord user tokens to a remote server. This allows attackers to make purchases
  on behalf of users if they have credit cards linked to their Discord accounts. ##

  account access and rotate tokens if possible. If a credit card was linked to a compromised
  account contact your credit card company."
