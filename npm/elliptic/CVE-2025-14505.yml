package_slug: "npm/elliptic"
title: "Elliptic Uses a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation"
description: "The ECDSA implementation of the Elliptic package generates incorrect
  signatures if an interim value of 'k' (as computed based on step 3.2 of  RFC 6979
  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6979 ) has leading zeros and is susceptible
  to cryptanalysis, which can lead to secret key exposure. This happens, because the
  byte-length of 'k' is incorrectly computed, resulting in its getting truncated during
  the computation. Legitimate transactions or communications will be broken as a result. Furthermore,
  due to the nature of the fault, attackers could–under certain conditions–derive
  the secret key, if they could get their hands on both a faulty signature generated
  by a vulnerable version of Elliptic and a correct signature for the same inputs.\n\nThis
  issue affects all known versions of Elliptic (at the time of writing, versions less
  than or equal to 6.6.1)."
