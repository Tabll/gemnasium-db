description: "Misskey is an open source, decentralized social media platform. In versions
  prior to 13.5.0 the link to the instance to the sender that appears when viewing
  a user or note received through ActivityPub is not properly validated, so by inserting
  a URL with a javascript scheme an attacker may execute JavaScript code in the context
  of the recipient. This issue has been fixed in version 13.5.0. Users are advised
  to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should not \"view on remote\" for untrusted
  instances."
