package_slug: "npm/@kindspells/astro-shield"
title: "In Astro-Shield, setting a correct `integrity` attribute to injected code
  allows to bypass the allow-lists"
description: "Versions from 1.2.0 to 1.3.1 of Astro-Shield allow to bypass the allow-lists
  for cross-origin resources by introducing valid `integrity` attributes to the injected
  code. This implies that the injected SRI hash would be added to the generated CSP
  header, which would lead the browser to believe that the injected resource is legit.\n\nTo
  exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs to first inject code into the rendered
  pages by exploiting other not-related potential vulnerabilities."
