title: "Global node_modules Binary Overwrite in bin-links"
description: "Versions of `bin-links` are vulnerable to a Global node_modules Binary
  Overwrite. It fails to prevent globally-installed binaries to be overwritten by
  other package installs. For example, if a package was installed globally and created
  a `serve` binary, any subsequent installs of packages that also create a `serve`
  binary would overwrite the first binary. This behavior is still allowed in local
  installations."
