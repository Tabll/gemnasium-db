title: "Arbitrary File Write in bin-links"
description: "Versions of `bin-links` are vulnerable to an Arbitrary File Write. The
  package fails to restrict access to folders outside of the intended `node_modules`
  folder through the `bin` field. This allows attackers to create arbitrary files
  in the system. Note it is not possible to overwrite files that already exist. ##
