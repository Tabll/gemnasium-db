package_slug: "npm/@theia/mini-browser"
title: "Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity"
description: "In Eclipse Theia versions 0.3.9 through 0.15.0, one of the default pre-packaged
  Theia extensions is \"Mini-Browser\", published as \"@theia/mini-browser\" on npmjs.com.
  This extension, for its own needs, exposes a HTTP endpoint that allows to read the
  content of files on the host's filesystem, given their path, without restrictions
  on the requester's origin. This design is vulnerable to being exploited remotely
  through a DNS rebinding attack or a drive-by download of a carefully crafted exploit."
