title: "smol-toml has a Denial of Service via malicious TOML document using deeply
  nested inline tables"
description: "An attacker can send a maliciously crafted TOML to cause the parser
  to crash because of a stack overflow caused by a deeply nested inline structure.
  A similar problem occurs when attempting to stringify deeply nested objects.\n\nThe
  library does not limit the maximum exploration depth while parsing or producing
  TOML documents, nor does it offer a way to do so."
