title: "Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information in zsa"
description: "All users are impacted. The zsa application transfers the parse error
  stack from the server to the client in production build mode. This can potentially
  reveal sensitive information about the server environment, such as the machine username
  and directory paths. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized
  access to sensitive server information. This information could be used to plan further
  attacks or gain a deeper understanding of the server infrastructure."
