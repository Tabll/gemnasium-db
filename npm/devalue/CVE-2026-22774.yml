package_slug: "npm/devalue"
title: "Devalue is vulnerable to denial of service due to memory exhaustion in devalue.parse"
description: "Certain inputs can cause `devalue.parse` to consume excessive CPU time
  and/or memory, potentially leading to denial of service in systems that parse input
  from untrusted sources. This affects applications using `devalue.parse` on externally-supplied
  data. The root cause is the typed array hydration expecting an `ArrayBuffer` as
  input, but not checking the assumption before creating the typed array."
