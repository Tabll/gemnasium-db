title: "devalue affected by CPU and memory amplification from sparse arrays"
description: "Under certain circumstances, serializing sparse arrays using `uneval`
  or `stringify` could cause CPU and/or memory exhaustion. When this occurs on the
  server, it results in a DoS. This is extremely difficult to take advantage of in
  practice, as an attacker would have to manage to create a sparse array on the server
  — which is impossible in every mainstream wire format — and then that sparse array
  would have to be run through `uneval` or `stringify`."
