identifier: "CVE-2017-16035"
package_slug: "npm/hubl-server"
title: "Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information"
description: "During installation hubl-server downloads a set of dependencies from
  `api.hubapi.com.` It appears in the code that these files are downloaded over HTTPS
  however the `api.hubapi.com` endpoint redirects to an HTTP url. Because of this
  behavior an attacker with the ability to man-in-the-middle a developer or system
  performing a package installation could compromise the integrity of the installation."
