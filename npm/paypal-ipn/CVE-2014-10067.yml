package_slug: "npm/paypal-ipn"
title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "paypal-ipn before 3.0.0 uses the `test_ipn` parameter (which is set
  by the PayPal IPN simulator) to determine if it should use the production PayPal
  site or the sandbox. With a bit of time, an attacker could craft a request using
  the simulator that would fool any application which does not explicitly check for
  test_ipn in production."
