title: "Validation bypass"
description: "paypal-ipn uses the `test_ipn` parameter (which is set by the PayPal
  IPN simulator) to determine if it should use the production PayPal site or the sandbox.
  \"With a bit of time, an attacker could craft a request using the simulator that
  would fool any application which does not explicitly check for test_ipn in production.\"
