package_slug: "npm/passport"
title: "Session Fixation"
description: "@fastify/passport is a port of passport authentication library for the
  Fastify ecosystem. Applications using `@fastify/passport` in affected versions for
  user authentication, in combination with `@fastify/session` as the underlying session
  management mechanism, is vulnerable to session fixation attacks from network and
  same-site attackers. fastify applications rely on the `@fastify/passport` library
  for user authentication. The login and user validation are performed by the `authenticate`
  function. When executing this function, the `sessionId` is preserved between the
  pre-login and the authenticated session. Network and same-site attackers can hijack
  the victim's session by tossing a valid `sessionId` cookie in the victim's browser
  and waiting for the victim to log in on the website. As a solution, newer versions
  of `@fastify/passport` regenerate `sessionId` upon login, preventing the attacker-controlled
  pre-session cookie from being upgraded to an authenticated session. Users are advised
  to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n"
