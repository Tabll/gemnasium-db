title: "Compromised xrpl.js versions 4.2.1, 4.2.2, 4.2.3, 4.2.4, and 2.14.2"
description: "Versions 4.2.1, 4.2.2, 4.2.3, and 4.2.4 of xrpl.js were compromised
  and contained malicious code designed to exfiltrate private keys. If you are using
  one of these versions, stop immediately and rotate any private keys or secrets used
  with affected systems.\n\nVersion 2.14.2 is also malicious, though it is less likely
  to lead to exploitation as it is not compatible with other 2.x versions."
