package_slug: "npm/baremetrics-calendar"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "The Baremetrics date range picker is a solution for selecting both date
  ranges and single dates from a single calender view. Versions 1.0.14 and prior are
  prone to cross-site scripting (XSS) when handling untrusted `placeholder` entries.
  An attacker who is able to influence the field `placeholder` when creating a `Calendar`
  instance is able to supply arbitrary `html` or `javascript` that will be rendered
  in the context of a user leading to XSS. There are no known patches for this issue."
