title: "Regular Expression Denial of Service"
description: "The primary function, `minimatch(path, pattern)` is vulnerable to ReDoS
  in the `pattern` parameter. This is because of the regular expression on line of
  minimatch.js: `/((?:\\\\{2})*)(\\\\?)\\|/g,`. The problematic portion of the regex
  is `((?:\\\\{2})*)` which matches against `//`."
