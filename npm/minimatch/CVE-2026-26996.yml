title: "minimatch has a ReDoS via repeated wildcards with non-matching literal in
  pattern"
description: "`minimatch` is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
  when a glob pattern contains many consecutive `*` wildcards followed by a literal
  character that doesn't appear in the test string. Each `*` compiles to a separate
  `[^/]*?` regex group, and when the match fails, V8's regex engine backtracks exponentially
  across all possible splits.\n\nThe time complexity is O(4^N) where N is the number
  of `*` characters. With N=15, a single `minimatch()` call takes ~2 seconds. With
  N=34, it hangs effectively forever."
