title: "Duplicate Advisory: Command Injection in node-rules"
description: "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-f78f-353m-cf4j. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n## Original Description\nVersions of `node-rules` prior to 5.0.0
  are vulnerable to Command Injection. The package fails to sanitize input rules and
  passes it directly to an `eval` call when using the `fromJSON` function. This may
  allow attackers to execute arbitrary code in the system if the rules are user-controlled.\n\n\n##
  Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 5.0.0 or later."
