title: "Prototype Pollution in getsetdeep"
description: "All versions of `getsetdeep` are vulnerable to prototype pollution.
  The `setDeep()` function does not restrict the modification of an Object's prototype,
  which may allow an attacker to add or modify an existing property that will exist
  on all objects. \n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative
  package until a fix is made available."
