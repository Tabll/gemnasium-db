description: "URI.js is a Javascript URL mutation library. Before version 1.19.9,
  whitespace characters are not removed from the beginning of the protocol, so URLs
  are not parsed properly. This issue has been patched in version 1.19.9. Removing
  leading whitespace from values before passing them to URI.parse can be used as a
  workaround."
