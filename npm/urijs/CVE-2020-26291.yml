identifier: "CVE-2020-26291"
package_slug: "npm/urijs"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "In URI.js the hostname can be spoofed by using a backslash `\\` character
  followed by an at `@` character. If the hostname is used in security decisions,
  the decision may be incorrect. Depending on library usage and attacker intent, impacts
  may include allow/block list bypasses, SSRF attacks, open redirects, or other undesired
  behavior. For example the URL `https://expected-example.com\\@observed-example.com`
  will incorrectly return `observed-example.com` if using an affected version."
