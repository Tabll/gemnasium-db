description: "## Test breaking\n\n### Impact\nIn v1.2.0, tests are broken: all tests
  are always succeeding. If tests are looking for security vulnerabilities, these
  were compromised.\n\n### Patches\nUsers should upgrade to `v1.2.1`\n\n### Workarounds\nUsers
  who don't use eye.js for looking for vulnerabilities are safe. Upgrading will just
  fix some bugs.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments
  about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [EyeJS](https://github.com/arguiot/EyeJS)\n*
