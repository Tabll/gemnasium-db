package_slug: "npm/react-admin"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "react-admin is a frontend framework for building browser applications
  on top of REST/GraphQL APIs. react-admin prior to versions 3.19.12 and 4.7.6, along
  with ra-ui-materialui prior to 3.19.12 and 4.7.6, is vulnerable to cross-site scripting.
  All React applications built with react-admin and using the `<RichTextField>` are
  affected. `<RichTextField>` outputs the field value using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
  without client-side sanitization. If the data isn't sanitized server-side, this
  opens a possible cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. Versions 3.19.12 and 4.7.6 now
  use `DOMPurify` to escape the HTML before outputting it with React and `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
  Users who already sanitize HTML data server-side do not need to upgrade. As a workaround,
  users may replace the `<RichTextField>` by a custom field doing sanitization by
  hand."
