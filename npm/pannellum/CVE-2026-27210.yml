package_slug: "npm/pannellum"
title: "Pannellum has a XSS vulnerability in hot spot attributes"
description: "The hot spot `attributes` configuration property allowed any attribute
  to be set, including HTML event handler attributes, allowing for potential XSS attacks.
  This affects websites hosting the standalone viewer HTML file and any other use
  of untrusted JSON config files (bypassing the protections of the `escapeHTML` parameter).
  As certain events fire without any additional user interaction, visiting a standalone
  viewer URL that points to a malicious config file&mdash;without additional user
  interaction&mdash;is sufficient to trigger the vulnerability and execute arbitrary
  JavaScript code, which can, for example, replace the contents of the page with arbitrary
  content and make it appear to be hosted by the website hosting the standalone viewer
  HTML file."
