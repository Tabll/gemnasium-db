title: "Child processes spawned by Renovate incorrectly have full access to environment
  variables"
description: "When Renovate spawns child processes, their access to environment variables
  is filtered to an allowlist, to prevent unauthorized access to privileged credentials
  that the Renovate process has access to.\n\nSince [42.68.1](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/releases/tag/42.68.1)
  (2025-12-30), this filtering had been **inadvertently removed**, and so any child
  processes spawned from these versions will have had access to any environment variables
  that Renovate has access to.\n\nThis could lead to [insider attackers](https://docs.renovatebot.com/security-and-permissions/#execution-of-code-insider-attack)
  and [outside attackers](https://docs.renovatebot.com/security-and-permissions/#execution-of-code-outsider-attack)
  being able to exflitrate secrets from the Renovate deployment.\n\nIt is recommended
  to rotate (+ revoke) any credentials that Renovate has access to, in case any spawned
  child processes have attempted to exfiltrate any secrets."
