title: "Azure DevOps token leakage in logs"
description: "### Impact\n\nApplies to Azure DevOps users only. The bot's token may
  be exposed in server or pipeline logs due to the `http.extraheader=AUTHORIZATION`
  parameter being logged without redaction. It is recommended that Azure DevOps users
  revoke their existing bot credentials and generate new ones after upgrading if there's
  a potential that logs have been saved to a location that others can view.\n\n###
  Patches\n\nFixed \n\n### Workarounds\n\nDo not share Renovate logs with anyone who
  cannot be trusted with access to the token.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you
  have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [security@renovatebot.com](mailto:security@renovatebot.com)"
