title: "Feathers has an origin validation bypass via prefix matching"
description: "The origin validation uses `startsWith()` for comparison, allowing attackers
  to bypass the check by registering a domain that shares a common prefix with an
  allowed origin.\n\nThe `getAllowedOrigin()` function checks if the Referer header
  starts with any allowed origin:\n```javascript\n// https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers/blob/dove/packages/authentication-oauth/src/strategy.ts#L75\nconst
  allowedOrigin = origins.find((current) => referer.toLowerCase().startsWith(current.toLowerCase()));\n```\n\nThis
  comparison is insufficient as it only validates the prefix. This is exploitable
  when the `origins` array is configured and an attacker registers a domain starting
  with an allowed origin string (e.g., `https://target.com.attacker.com` bypasses
  `https://target.com`).\n\nOn its own, tokens are still redirected to a configured
  origin. However, in specific scenarios an attacker can initiate the OAuth flow from
  an unauthorized origin and exfiltrate tokens, achieving full account takeover.\n\n**Credits**:
