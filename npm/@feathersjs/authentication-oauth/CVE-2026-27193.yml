title: "Feathers exposes internal headers via unencrypted session cookie"
description: "All HTTP request headers are stored in the session cookie, which is
  signed but not encrypted, exposing internal proxy/gateway headers to clients.\n\nThe
  OAuth service stores the complete headers object in the session:\n```javascript\n//
  https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers/blob/dove/packages/authentication-oauth/src/service.ts#L173\nsession.headers
  = headers;\n```\n\nThe session is persisted using `cookie-session`, which base64-encodes
  the data. While the cookie is signed to prevent tampering, the contents are readable
  by anyone by simply decoding the base64 value.\n\nUnder specific deployment configurations
  (e.g., behind reverse proxies or API gateways), this can lead to exposure of sensitive
  internal infrastructure details such as API keys, service tokens, and internal IP
  addresses.\n\n**Credits**:  Abdelwahed Madani Yousfi (@vvxhid) / Edoardo Geraci
