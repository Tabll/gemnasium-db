title: "Feathers has an open redirect in OAuth callback enables account takeover"
description: "The `redirect` query parameter is appended to the base origin without
  validation, allowing attackers to steal access tokens via URL authority injection.
  This leads to full account takeover, as the attacker obtains the victim's access
  token and can impersonate them.\n\nThe application constructs the final redirect
  URL by concatenating the base origin with the user-supplied `redirect` parameter:\n```javascript\n//
  https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers/blob/dove/packages/authentication-oauth/src/service.ts#L158C3-L176C4\nconst
  { redirect } = query;\n...\nsession.redirect = redirect;\n\n// https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers/blob/dove/packages/authentication-oauth/src/strategy.ts#L98\nconst
  redirectUrl = `${redirect}${queryRedirect}`;\n```\n\nWhere:\n- `redirect` = base
  origin from config (e.g., `https://target.com`)\n- `queryRedirect` = user input
  from `?redirect=` parameter\n\nThis is exploitable when the `origins` array is configured
  and origin values do not end with `/`.  An attacker can supply `@attacker.com` as
  the redirect value results in `https://target.com@attacker.com#access_token=...`,
  where the browser interprets `attacker.com` as the host, leading to full account
  takeover.\n\n**Credits**:  Abdelwahed Madani Yousfi (@vvxhid) / Edoardo Geraci (@b0-n0-b0)
