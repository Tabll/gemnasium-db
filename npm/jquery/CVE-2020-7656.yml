package_slug: "npm/jquery"
title: "Cross-Site Scripting in jquery"
description: "Versions of `jquery` prior to 1.9.0 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting.
  The load method fails to recognize and remove `<script>` HTML tags that contain
  a whitespace character, i.e: `</script >`, which results in the enclosed script
  logic to be executed. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in a
  victim's browser."
