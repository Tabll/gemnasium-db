title: "DOM Expressions has a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper
  use of string.replace"
description: "> [!NOTE]\n> This advisory was originally emailed to community@solidjs.com
  by @nsysean.\n\nTo sum it up, the use of javascript's `.replace()` opens up to potential
  XSS vulnerabilities with the special replacement patterns beginning with `$`.\n\nParticularly,
  when the attributes of `Meta` tag from solid-meta are user-defined, attackers can
  utilise the special replacement patterns, either `$'` or `$\\`` to achieve XSS.\n\nThe
  solid-meta package has this issue since it uses `useAffect` and context providers,
  which injects the used assets in the html header. \"dom-expressions\" uses `.replace()`
  to insert the assets, which is vulnerable to the special replacement patterns listed
  above.\n\nThis effectively means that if the attributes of an asset tag contained
  user-controlled data, it would be vulnerable to XSS. For instance, there might be
  meta tags for the open graph protocol in a user profile page, but if attackers set
  the user query to some payload abusing `.replace()`, then they could execute arbitrary
  javascript in the victim's web browser. Moreover, it could be stored and cause more
  problems."
