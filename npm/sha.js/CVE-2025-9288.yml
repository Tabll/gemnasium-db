- "GHSA-95m3-7q98-8xr5"
package_slug: "npm/sha.js"
title: "sha.js is missing type checks leading to hash rewind and passing on crafted
  data"
description: "This is the same as [GHSA-cpq7-6gpm-g9rc](https://github.com/browserify/cipher-base/security/advisories/GHSA-cpq7-6gpm-g9rc)
  but just for `sha.js`, as it has its own implementation.\n\nMissing input type checks
  can allow types other than a well-formed `Buffer` or `string`, resulting in invalid
  values, hanging and rewinding the hash state (including turning a tagged hash into
  an untagged hash), or other generally undefined behaviour."
