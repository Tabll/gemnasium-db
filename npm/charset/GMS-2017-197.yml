title: "Regular Expression Denial of Service"
description: "charset is vulnerable to regular expression denial of service. Input
  of around k characters is required for a slow down of around 2 seconds. Unless node
  was compiled using the `-DHTTP_MAX_HEADER_SIZE=` option the default header max length
  is kb so the impact of the ReDoS is relatively low."
