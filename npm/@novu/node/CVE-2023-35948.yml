title: "URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')"
description: "Novu provides an API for sending notifications through multiple channels.
  Versions prior to 0.16.0 contain an open redirect vulnerability in the \"Sign In
  with GitHub\" functionality of Novu's open-source repository. It could have allowed
  an attacker to force a victim into opening a malicious URL and thus, potentially
  log into the repository under the victim's account gaining full control of the account.
  This vulnerability only affected the Novu Cloud and Open-Source deployments if the
  user manually enabled the GitHub OAuth on their self-hosted instance of Novu. Users
  should upgrade to version 0.16.0 to receive a patch."
