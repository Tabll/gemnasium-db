title: "Regular Expression Denial of Service"
description: "The `tough-cookie` module is vulnerable to regular expression denial
  of service. Input of around 50k characters is required for a slow down of around 2
  seconds. Unless node was compiled using the `-DHTTP_MAX_HEADER_SIZE=` option the
  default header max length is kb so the impact of the ReDoS is limited to around
  7.3 seconds of blocking."
