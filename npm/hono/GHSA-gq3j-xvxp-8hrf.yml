title: "Hono added timing comparison hardening in basicAuth and bearerAuth"
description: "The `basicAuth` and `bearerAuth` middlewares previously used a comparison
  that was not fully timing-safe.\n\nThe `timingSafeEqual` function used normal string
  equality (`===`) when comparing hash values. This comparison may stop early if values
  differ, which can theoretically cause small timing differences.\n\nThe implementation
  has been updated to use a safer comparison method."
