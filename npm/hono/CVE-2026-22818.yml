title: "Hono JWK Auth Middleware has JWT algorithm confusion when JWK lacks \"alg\"
  (untrusted header.alg fallback)"
description: "A flaw in Hono’s JWK/JWKS JWT verification middleware allowed the algorithm
  specified in the JWT header to influence signature verification when the selected
  JWK did not explicitly define an algorithm. This could enable JWT algorithm confusion
  and, in certain configurations, allow forged tokens to be accepted."
