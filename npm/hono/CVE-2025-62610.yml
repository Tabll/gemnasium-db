package_slug: "npm/hono"
title: "Hono Improper Authorization vulnerability"
description: "Hono’s **JWT Auth Middleware does not provide a built-in `aud` (Audience)
  verification option**, which can cause **confused-deputy / token-mix-up** issues:
  an API may accept a valid token that was **issued for a different audience** (e.g.,
  another service) when multiple services share the same issuer/keys. This can lead
  to unintended cross-service access. Hono’s docs list verification options for `iss/nbf/iat/exp`
  only, with **no `aud` support**; RFC 7519 requires that when an `aud` claim is present,
  tokens **MUST** be rejected unless the processing party identifies itself in that
  claim.\n\n**Note:** This problem likely exists in the **JWK/JWKS-based middleware**
  as well (e.g., `jwk` / `verifyWithJwks`)"
