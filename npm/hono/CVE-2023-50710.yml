package_slug: "npm/hono"
title: "Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')"
description: "Hono is a web framework written in TypeScript. Prior to version 3.11.7,
  clients may override named path parameter values from previous requests if the application
  is using TrieRouter. So, there is a risk that a privileged user may use unintended
  parameters when deleting REST API resources. TrieRouter is used either explicitly
  or when the application matches a pattern that is not supported by the default RegExpRouter.
  Version 3.11.7 includes the change to fix this issue. As a workaround, avoid using
  TrieRouter directly."
