title: "Hono IPv4 address validation bypass in IP Restriction Middleware allows IP
  spoofing"
description: "IP Restriction Middleware in Hono is vulnerable to an IP address validation
  bypass. The `IPV4_REGEX` pattern and `convertIPv4ToBinary` function in `src/utils/ipaddr.ts`
  do not properly validate that IPv4 octet values are within the valid range of 0-255,
  allowing attackers to craft malformed IP addresses that bypass IP-based access controls."
