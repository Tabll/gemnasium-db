title: "enclave-vm Vulnerable to Sandbox Escape via Host Error Prototype Chain"
description: "A critical sandbox escape vulnerability exists in **enclave-vm v2.3.0**
  that allows untrusted, sandboxed JavaScript code to execute arbitrary code in the
  **host Node.js runtime**.\n\nWhen a tool invocation fails, enclave-vm exposes a
  **host-side Error object** to sandboxed code. This Error object retains its **host
  realm prototype chain**, which can be traversed to reach the **host `Function` constructor**.\n\nAn
  attacker can intentionally trigger a host error (for example, by invoking a non-existent
  tool), then climb the prototype chain:\n\n```\nError instance → Error.prototype
  → Error constructor → Function constructor\n```\n\nUsing the host `Function` constructor,
  arbitrary JavaScript can be compiled and executed in the host context, fully bypassing
  the sandbox and granting access to sensitive resources such as `process.env`, filesystem,
  and network.\n\nThis breaks enclave-vm’s core security guarantee of isolating untrusted
  code.\n\n---"
