title: "enclave-vm Vulnerable to Sandbox Escape via Host Error Prototype Chain"
description: "A critical sandbox escape vulnerability exists in **enclave-vm** (affected:
  **< 2.6.0**, patched: **2.7.0**) that can allow untrusted, sandboxed JavaScript
  to execute arbitrary code in the **host Node.js runtime**.\n\nWhen a tool invocation
  fails, enclave-vm exposes a **host-side Error object** to sandboxed code. This Error
  object retains its **host realm prototype chain**, which can be traversed to reach
  the **host `Function` constructor**:\n\n`Error instance → Error.prototype → Error
  constructor → Function constructor`\n\nWith access to the host `Function` constructor,
  an attacker can compile and execute arbitrary JavaScript in the host context — bypassing
  the sandbox boundary and potentially gaining access to sensitive resources such
  as `process.env`, filesystem, and network.\n\nThis breaks enclave-vm’s core security
  guarantee of isolating untrusted code.\n\n---"
