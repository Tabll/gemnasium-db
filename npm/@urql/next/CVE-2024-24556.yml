title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "urql is a GraphQL client that exposes a set of helpers for several frameworks.
  The `@urql/next` package is vulnerable to XSS. To exploit this an attacker would
  need to ensure that the response returns `html` tags and that the web-application
  is using streamed responses (non-RSC). This vulnerability is due to improper escaping
  of html-like characters in the response-stream. To fix this vulnerability upgrade
  to version 1.1.1"
