identifiers:
- "CVE-2022-25863"
package_slug: "npm/gatsby"
title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "The package gatsby-plugin-mdx before 2.14.1, from 3.0.0 and before 3.15.2
  is vulnerable to Deserialization of Untrusted Data when passing input through to
  the gray-matter package, due to its default configurations that are missing input
  sanitization. Exploiting this vulnerability is possible when passing input in both
  webpack (MDX files in src/pages or MDX file imported as a component in frontend
  / React code) and data mode (querying MDX nodes via GraphQL). Workaround: If an
  older version of gatsby-plugin-mdx must be used, input passed into the plugin should
  be sanitized ahead of processing."
