package_slug: "npm/gatsby"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps
  developers build websites and apps. The gatsby-transformer-remark plugin prior to
  versions 5.25.1 and 6.3.2 passes input through to the `gray-matter` npm package,
  which is vulnerable to JavaScript injection in its default configuration, unless
  input is sanitized. The vulnerability is present in gatsby-transformer-remark when
  passing input in data mode (querying MarkdownRemark nodes via GraphQL). Injected
  JavaScript executes in the context of the build server. To exploit this vulnerability
  untrusted/unsanitized input would need to be sourced by or added into a file processed
  by gatsby-transformer-remark. A patch has been introduced in `gatsby-transformer-remark@5.25.1`
  and `gatsby-transformer-remark@6.3.2` which mitigates the issue by disabling the
  `gray-matter` JavaScript Frontmatter engine. As a workaround, if an older version
  of `gatsby-transformer-remark` must be used, input passed into the plugin should
  be sanitized ahead of processing. It is encouraged for projects to upgrade to the
  latest major release branch for all Gatsby plugins to ensure the latest security
  updates and bug fixes are received in a timely manner."
