title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "Hydrogen is a React-based framework for building dynamic, Shopify-powered
  custom storefronts. There is a potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
  where an arbitrary user is able to execute scripts on pages that are built with
  Hydrogen. This affects all versions of Hydrogen starting from version 0.10.0 to
  0.18.0. This vulnerability is exploitable in applications whose hydrating data is
  user controlled. All Hydrogen users should upgrade their project to version 0.19.0.
  There is no current workaround, and users should update as soon as possible. Additionally,
  the Content Security Policy is not an effective mitigation for this vulnerability."
