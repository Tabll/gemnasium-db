- "GHSA-g8p2-7wf7-98mq"
package_slug: "npm/clawdbot"
title: "OpenClaw/Clawdbot has 1-Click RCE via Authentication Token Exfiltration From
  gatewayUrl"
description: "The Control UI trusts `gatewayUrl` from the query string without validation
  and auto-connects on load, sending the stored gateway token in the WebSocket connect
  payload.\n\nClicking a crafted link or visiting a malicious site can send the token
  to an attacker-controlled server. The attacker can then connect to the victim's
  local gateway, modify config (sandbox, tool policies), and invoke privileged actions,
  achieving 1-click RCE. This vulnerability is exploitable even on instances configured
  to listen on loopback only, since the victim's browser initiates the outbound connection."
