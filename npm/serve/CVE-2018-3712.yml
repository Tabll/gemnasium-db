identifier: "CVE-2018-3712"
package_slug: "npm/serve"
title: "Directory Traversal"
description: "`serve` does not properly handle `%2e` (.) and `%2f` (/) and allows
  these characters to be used in paths, which can be used to traverse the directory
  tree up and lists content of any directory the user running the process has access
  to. Mitigating factors: This vulnerability only allows listing of directory contents
  and does not allow reading of arbitrary files."
