title: "Prototype Pollution in mout"
description: "This affects all versions of package mout. The deepFillIn function can
  be used to 'fill missing properties recursively', while the deepMixIn mixes objects
  into the target object, recursively mixing existing child objects as well. In both
  cases, the key used to access the target object recursively is not checked, leading
  to exploiting this vulnerability. **Note:** This vulnerability derives from an incomplete
  fix of [CVE-2020-7792](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-MOUT-1014544)."
