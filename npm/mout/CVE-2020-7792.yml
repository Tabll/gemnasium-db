identifier: "CVE-2020-7792"
package_slug: "npm/mout"
title: "Prototype Pollution"
description: "The `deepFillIn` function can be used to fill missing properties 
  recursively, while the `deepMixIn` mixes objects into the target object, 
  recursively mixing existing child objects as well. In both cases, the key 
  used to access the target object recursively is not checked, leading
  to a Prototype Pollution."
