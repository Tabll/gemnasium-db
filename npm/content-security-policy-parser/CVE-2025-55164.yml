title: "content-security-policy-parser Prototype Pollution Vulnerability May Lead
  to RCE"
description: "A prototype pollution vulnerability exists in versions 0.5.0 and earlier,
  wherein if you provide a policy name called `__proto__` you can override the Object
  prototype.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nconst parse = require('content-security-policy-parser');\n\nconst
  x = parse(\"default-src 'self'; __proto__ foobar\");\nconsole.log('raw print:',
  x);\nconsole.log('toString:', x.toString());\n```\n\nOutputs:\n\n```\nraw print:
  Array { 'default-src': [ \"'self'\" ] }\ntoString: foobar\n```\n\nWhilst no gadget
  exists in this library, it is possible via other libraries expose functionality
  that enable RCE. It is customary to label prototype pollution vulnerabilities in
  this way. The most common effect of this is denial of service, as you can trivially
  overwrite properties.\n\nAs the content security policy is provided in HTTP queries,
  it is incredibly likely that network exploitation is possible."
