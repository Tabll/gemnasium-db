title: "@dapperduckling/keycloak-connector-server has Reflected XSS Vulnerability
  in Authentication Flow URL Handling"
description: "**Impact**\nA Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was
  discovered in the authentication flow of the application. This issue arises due
  to improper sanitization of the URL parameters, allowing the URL bar's contents
  to be injected and reflected into the HTML page. An attacker could craft a malicious
  URL to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the browser of a victim who visits the link.\n\n**Who
  is impacted?**\nAny application utilizing this authentication library is vulnerable.
  Users of the application are at risk if they can be lured into clicking on a crafted
  malicious link.\n\n**Patches**\nThe vulnerability has been patched in **2.5.5**
  by ensuring proper sanitization and escaping of user input in the affected URL parameters.\n\nUsers
  are strongly encouraged to upgrade to the following versions:\n\n**Workarounds**\nIf
  upgrading is not immediately possible, users can implement the following workarounds:\n-
  Employ a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to block malicious requests containing suspicious
  URL parameters.\n- Apply input validation and escaping directly within the applicationâ€™s
  middleware or reverse proxy layer, specifically targeting the affected parameters.\n\n**References**\n-
