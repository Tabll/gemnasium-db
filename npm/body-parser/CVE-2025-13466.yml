title: "body-parser is vulnerable to denial of service when url encoding is used"
description: "body-parser 2.2.0 is vulnerable to denial of service due to inefficient
  handling of URL-encoded bodies with very large numbers of parameters. An attacker
  can send payloads containing thousands of parameters within the default 100KB request
  size limit, causing elevated CPU and memory usage. This can lead to service slowdown
  or partial outages under sustained malicious traffic."
