Note that this Changelog lists only notable changes; notable changes are
changes that lead to minor and major version updates, e.g.,
backwards-compatible YAML schema changes (adding/removing optional fields from
the YAML schema) and/or non-backwards-compatible YAML schema changes).  You can
find more details about our semantic versioning approach in the [corresponding README.md section](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/gemnasium-db#versioning-and-changelog).
