title: "Agent Dart is missing certificate verification checks"
description: "Certificate verification (in [lib/agent/certificate.dart](https://github.com/AstroxNetwork/agent_dart/blob/main/lib/agent/certificate.dart))
  has been found to contain two issues:\n- During the delegation verification (in
  [_checkDelegation](https://github.com/AstroxNetwork/agent_dart/blob/f50971dfae3f536c1720f0084f28afbcf5d99cb5/lib/agent/certificate.dart#L162)
  function) the canister_ranges aren't verified. The impact of not checking the canister_ranges
  is that a subnet can sign canister responses in behalf of another subnet. You have
  more details in the IC specification [here](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec#certification-delegation).
  Also for reference you can check how is this implemented in [the agent-rs](https://github.com/dfinity/agent-rs/blob/608a3f4cfdcdfc5ca1ca74a1b9d33f2137a2d324/ic-agent/src/agent/mod.rs#L903-L914).\n-
  The certificate’s timestamp, i.e /time path, is not verified, meaning that the certificate
  effectively has no expiration time. The [IC spec](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec#http-query)
  doesn’t specify an expiry times, it gives some suggestions, quoting: \"A reasonable
  expiry time for timestamps in R.signatures and the certificate Cert is 5 minutes
  (analogously to the maximum allowed ingress expiry enforced by the IC mainnet).
  Delegations require expiry times of at least a week since the IC mainnet refreshes
  the delegations only after replica upgrades which typically happen once a week\".
  For reference you can check how is this implemented in the agent-rs ([here](https://github.com/dfinity/agent-rs/blob/608a3f4cfdcdfc5ca1ca74a1b9d33f2137a2d324/ic-agent/src/agent/mod.rs#L820)
  and [here](https://github.com/dfinity/agent-rs/blob/608a3f4cfdcdfc5ca1ca74a1b9d33f2137a2d324/ic-agent/src/agent/mod.rs#L876-L887)).\n\n**Additionally**,
  seems [replica signed queries](https://internetcomputer.org/blog/features/replica-signed-queries)
  aren’t implemented"
