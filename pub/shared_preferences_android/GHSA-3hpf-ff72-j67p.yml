title: "shared_preferences_android vulnerability"
description: "Due to some data types not being natively representable for the available
  storage options, shared_preferences_android serializes and deserializes special
  string prefixes to store these unrepresentable data types. This allows arbitrary
  classes to be deserialized leading to arbitrary code execution.\n\nAs a result,
  Files containing the preferences can be overwritten with a malicious one with a
  deserialization payload that triggers as soon as the data is loaded from the disk."
