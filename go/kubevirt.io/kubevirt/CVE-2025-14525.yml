title: "KubeVirt Guest Agent DoS via Excessive Network Interface Reports"
description: "A flaw was found in KubeVirt. A user within a virtual machine (VM),
  if the guest agent is active, can exploit this by causing the agent to report an
  excessive number of network interfaces. This action can overwhelm the system's ability
  to store VM configuration updates, effectively blocking changes to the Virtual Machine
  Instance (VMI). This allows the VM user to restrict the VM administrator's ability
  to manage the VM, leading to a Denial of Dervice for administrative operations."
