package_slug: "go/open-cluster-management.io/ocm"
title: "Open Cluster Management vulnerable to Trust Boundary Violation"
description: "A flaw was found in Open Cluster Management (OCM) when a user has access
  to the worker nodes which contain the cluster-manager or klusterlet deployments.
  The cluster-manager deployment uses a service account with the same name \"cluster-manager\"
  which is bound to a ClusterRole also named \"cluster-manager\", which includes the
  permission to create Pod resources. If this deployment runs a pod on an attacker-controlled
  node, the attacker can obtain the cluster-manager's token and steal any service
  account token by creating and mounting the target service account to control the
  whole cluster."
