title: "net/http, x/net/http2: close connections when receiving too many headers"
description: "An attacker may cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of
  header data by sending an excessive number of CONTINUATION frames. Maintaining HPACK
  state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection.
  When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store
  the excess headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker to cause
  an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with
  a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded
  data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an
  attacker to send. The fix sets a limit on the amount of excess header frames we
  will process before closing a connection."
