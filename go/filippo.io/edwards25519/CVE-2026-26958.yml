title: "filippo.io/edwards25519 MultiScalarMult produces invalid results or undefined
  behavior if receiver is not the identity"
description: "`(*Point).MultiScalarMult` failed to initialize its receiver.\n\nIf
  the method was called on an initialized point that is not the identity point, MultiScalarMult
  produced an incorrect result.\n\nIf the method was called on an uninitialized point,
  the behavior was undefined. In particular, if the receiver was the zero value, MultiScalarMult
  returned an invalid point that compared Equal to every point.\n\n*Note that MultiScalarMult
  is a rarely used advanced API. For example, if you only depend on `filippo.io/edwards25519`
  via `github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql`, **you are not affected**. If you were notified
  of this issue despite not being affected, consider switching to a vulnerability
  scanner that is more precise and respectful of your attention, like [govulncheck](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/govulncheck).*"
