package_slug: "go/tailscale.com"
title: "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
description: "A vulnerability identified in the Tailscale Windows client allows a
  malicious website to reconfigure the Tailscale daemon `tailscaled`, which can then
  be used to remotely execute code. In the Tailscale Windows client, the local API
  was bound to a local TCP socket, and communicated with the Windows client GUI in
  cleartext with no Host header verification. This allowed an attacker-controlled
  website visited by the node to rebind DNS to an attacker-controlled DNS server,
  and then make local API requests in the client, including changing the coordination
  server to an attacker-controlled coordination server. An attacker-controlled coordination
  server can send malicious URL responses to the client, including pushing executables
  or installing an SMB share. These allow the attacker to remotely execute code on
  the node. All Windows clients prior to version v.1.32.3 are affected. If you are
  running Tailscale on Windows, upgrade to v1.32.3 or later to remediate the issue."
