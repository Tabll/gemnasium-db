title: "Improper Privilege Management"
description: "Tailscale is software for using Wireguard and multi-factor authentication
  (MFA). A vulnerability identified in the implementation of Tailscale SSH starting
  in version 1.34.0 and prior to prior to 1.38.2 in FreeBSD allows commands to be
  run with a higher privilege group ID than that specified in Tailscale SSH access
  rules. A difference in the behavior of the FreeBSD `setgroups` system call from
  POSIX meant that the Tailscale client running on a FreeBSD-based operating system
  does not appropriately restrict groups on the host when using Tailscale SSH. When
  accessing a FreeBSD host over Tailscale SSH, the egid of the tailscaled process
  was used instead of that of the user specified in Tailscale SSH access rules. Tailscale
  SSH commands may have been run with a higher privilege group ID than that specified
  in Tailscale SSH access rules if they met all of the following criteria: the destination
  node was a FreeBSD device with Tailscale SSH enabled; Tailscale SSH access rules
  permitted access for non-root users; and a non-interactive SSH session was used.
  Affected users should upgrade to version 1.38.2 to remediate the issue."
