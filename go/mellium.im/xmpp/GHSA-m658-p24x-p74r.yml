title: "Duplicate Advisory: TLS certificate validation error in mellium.im/xmpp"
description: "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-h289-x5wc-xcv8. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n## Original Description\nIn Mellium mellium.im/xmpp through 0.21.0,
  an attacker capable of spoofing DNS TXT records can redirect a WebSocket connection
  request to a server under their control without causing TLS certificate verification
  to fail. This occurs because the wrong host name is selected during this verification."
