package_slug: "go/mellium.im/sasl"
title: "Mellium vulnerable to authentication failure or insufficient randomness used
  during authentication"
description: "An issue was discovered in Mellium mellium.im/sasl before 0.3.1. When
  performing SCRAM-based SASL authentication, if the remote end advertises support
  for channel binding, no random nonce is generated (instead, the nonce is empty).
  This causes authentication to fail in the best case, but (if paired with a remote
  end that does not validate the length of the nonce) could lead to insufficient randomness
  being used during authentication."
