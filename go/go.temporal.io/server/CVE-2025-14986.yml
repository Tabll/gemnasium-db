package_slug: "go/go.temporal.io/server"
title: "Temporal has a namespace policy bypass allowing requests to be authorized
  for incorrect contexts"
description: "When frontend.enableExecuteMultiOperation is enabled, the server can
  apply namespace-scoped validation and feature gates for the embedded StartWorkflowExecutionRequest
  using its Namespace field rather than the outer, authorized ExecuteMultiOperationRequest.Namespace.
  This allows a caller authorized for one namespace to bypass that namespace's limits/policies
  by setting the embedded start request's namespace to a different namespace. The
  workflow is still created in the outer (authorized) namespace; only validation/gating
  is performed under the wrong namespace context.\nThis issue affects Temporal: from
  1.24.0 through 1.29.1. Fixed in 1.27.4, 1.28.2, 1.29.2."
