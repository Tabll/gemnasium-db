package_slug: "go/go.temporal.io/server"
title: "Insecure Default Initialization of Resource"
description: "Insecure defaults in open-source Temporal Server before version 1.20
  on all platforms allows an attacker to craft a task token with access to a namespace
  other than the one specified in the request. Creation of this task token must be
  done outside of the normal Temporal server flow. It requires the namespace UUID
  and information from the workflow history for the target namespace. Under these
  conditions, it is possible to interfere with pending tasks in other namespaces,
  such as marking a task failed or completed.\nIf a task is targeted for completion
  by the attacker, the targeted namespace must also be using the same data converter
  configuration as the initial, valid, namespace for the task completion payload to
  be decoded by workers in the target namespace.\n\n\n\n"
