package_slug: "go/go.temporal.io/server"
title: "Temporal has an Incorrect Authorization vulnerability"
description: "When system.enableCrossNamespaceCommands is enabled (on by default),
  the Temporal server permits certain workflow task commands (e.g. StartChildWorkflowExecution,
  SignalExternalWorkflowExecution, RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecution) to target
  a different namespace than the namespace authorized at the gRPC boundary. The frontend
  authorizes RespondWorkflowTaskCompleted based on the outer request namespace, but
  the history service later resolves and executes the command using the namespace
  embedded in command attributes without authorizing the caller for that target namespace.
  This can allow a worker authorized for one namespace to create, signal, or cancel
  workflows in another namespace.\nThis issue affects Temporal: through 1.29.1. Fixed
  in 1.27.4, 1.28.2, 1.29.2."
