title: "go.rgst.io/stencil/v2 vulnerable to Path Traversal"
description: "The library used to extract archives (github.com/jaredallard/archives)
  was vulnerable to the \"zip slip\" vulnerability. This is used to extract native
  extension archives and repository source archives. A native extension or repository
  archive could be crafted in such a way where a remote code execution or modification/reading
  of a file is possible using the user who is running stencil.\n\nThe severity is
  marked as \"medium\" because native extensions have always considered to be \"unsafe\"
  to run when not trusted. Native extensions are arbitrary code being ran, which could
  always do this same exploit with less steps. The medium severity is to reflect that
  this could be done even when a user is _not_ using a native extension, for example
  a repository source archive. However, one would need to mutate the archives provided
  by Github or perform some hackery with links, which may not be possible. Thus, \"medium\"
  is used out of an abundance of caution where I would've labeled this as \"low\"."
