package_slug: "go/kubernetesgithub.com/kubernetes/kubernetes"
title: "Kubernetes vulnerable to validation bypass"
description: "Users may have access to secure endpoints in the control plane network.
  Kubernetes clusters are only affected if an untrusted user can modify Node objects
  and send proxy requests to them. Kubernetes supports node proxying, which allows
  clients of kube-apiserver to access endpoints of a Kubelet to establish connections
  to Pods, retrieve container logs, and more. While Kubernetes already validates the
  proxying address for Nodes, a bug in kube-apiserver made it possible to bypass this
  validation. Bypassing this validation could allow authenticated requests destined
  for Nodes to to the API server's private network."
