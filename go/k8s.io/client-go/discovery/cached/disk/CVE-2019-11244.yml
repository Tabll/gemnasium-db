title: "Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource"
description: "In Kubernetes, schema info is cached by `kubectl` in the location specified
  by `--cache-dir` (defaulting to `$HOME/.kube/http-cache`), written with world-writeable
  permissions (`rw-rw-rw-`). If `--cache-dir` is specified and pointed at a different
  location accessible to other users/groups, the written files may be modified by
  other users/groups and disrupt the kubectl invocation."
