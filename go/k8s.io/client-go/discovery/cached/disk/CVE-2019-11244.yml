identifier: "CVE-2019-11244"
package_slug: "go/k8s.io/client-go/discovery/cached/disk"
title: "Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource"
description: "In Kubernetes, schema info is cached by `kubectl` in the location specified
  by `--cache-dir` (defaulting to `$HOME/.kube/http-cache`), written with world-writeable
  permissions (`rw-rw-rw-`). If `--cache-dir` is specified and pointed at a different
  location accessible to other users/groups, the written files may be modified by
  other users/groups and disrupt the kubectl invocation."
