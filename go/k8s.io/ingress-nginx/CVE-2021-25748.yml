title: "Ingress-nginx `path` sanitization can be bypassed with newline character"
description: "A security issue was discovered in ingress-nginx where a user that can
  create or update ingress objects can use a newline character to bypass the sanitization
  of the `spec.rules[].http.paths[].path` field of an Ingress object (in the `networking.k8s.io`
  or `extensions` API group) to obtain the credentials of the ingress-nginx controller.
  In the default configuration, that credential has access to all secrets in the cluster."
