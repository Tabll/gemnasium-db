package_slug: "go/k8s.io/ingress-nginx"
title: "ingress-nginx has Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions"
description: "A security issue was discovered in ingress-nginx where the protection
  afforded by the `auth-url` Ingress annotation may not be effective in the presence
  of a specific misconfiguration.\n\nIf the ingress-nginx controller is configured
  with a default custom-errors configuration that includes HTTP errors 401 or 403,
  and if the configured default custom-errors backend is defective and fails to respect
  the X-Code HTTP header, then an Ingress with the `auth-url` annotation may be accessed
  even when authentication fails.\n\nNote that the built-in custom-errors backend
  works correctly. Triggering this issue requires an administrator to specifically
  configure ingress-nginx with a broken external component."
