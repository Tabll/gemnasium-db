package_slug: "go/k8s.io/minikube"
title: "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
description: "In Minikube versions 0.3.0-0.29.0, minikube exposes the Kubernetes Dashboard
  listening on the VM IP at port 30000. In VM environments where the IP is easy to
  predict, the attacker can use DNS rebinding to indirectly make requests to the Kubernetes
  Dashboard, create a new Kubernetes Deployment running arbitrary code. If minikube
  mount is in use, the attacker could also directly access the host filesystem."
