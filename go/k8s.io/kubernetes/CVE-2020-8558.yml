package_slug: "go/k8s.io/kubernetes"
title: "Improper Authentication in Kubernetes"
description: "The Kubelet and kube-proxy components in versions 1.1.0-1.16.10, 1.17.0-1.17.6,
  and 1.18.0-1.18.3 were found to contain a security issue which allows adjacent hosts
  to reach TCP and UDP services bound to 127.0.0.1 running on the node or in the node's
  network namespace. Such a service is generally thought to be reachable only by other
  processes on the same host, but due to this defeect, could be reachable by other
  hosts on the same LAN as the node, or by containers running on the same node as
  the service."
