package_slug: "go/k8s.io/kubernetes"
title: "Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition"
description: "As mitigations to a report from 2019 and CVE-2020-8555, Kubernetes attempts
  to prevent proxied connections from accessing link-local or localhost networks when
  making user-driven connections to Services, Pods, Nodes, or StorageClass service
  providers. As part of this mitigation Kubernetes does a DNS name resolution check
  and validates that response IPs are not in the link-local (169.254.0.0/16) or localhost
  (127.0.0.0/8) range. Kubernetes then performs a second DNS resolution without validation
  for the actual connection. If a non-standard DNS server returns different non-cached
  responses, a user may be able to bypass the proxy IP restriction and access private
  networks on the control plane."
