title: "Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')"
description: "The Kubernetes kubectl cp command in versions 1.1-1.12, and versions
  prior to 1.13.11, 1.14.7, and 1.15.4 allows a combination of two symlinks provided
  by tar output of a malicious container to place a file outside of the destination
  directory specified in the kubectl cp invocation. This could be used to allow an
  attacker to place a nefarious file using a symlink, outside of the destination tree."
