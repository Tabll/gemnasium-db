package_slug: "go/k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/kubelet"
title: "Denial of service in Kubernetes"
description: "The Kubernetes kubelet component in versions 1.1-1.16.12, 1.17.0-1.17.8
  and 1.18.0-1.18.5 do not account for disk usage by a pod which writes to its own
  /etc/hosts file. The /etc/hosts file mounted in a pod by kubelet is not included
  by the kubelet eviction manager when calculating ephemeral storage usage by a pod.
  If a pod writes a large amount of data to the /etc/hosts file, it could fill the
  storage space of the node and cause the node to fail."
