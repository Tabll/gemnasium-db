identifier: "CVE-2020-8557"
package_slug: "go/k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/apis/apps/validation"
title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "The Kubernetes kubelet component do not account for disk usage by a
  pod which writes to its own `/etc/hosts` file. The `/etc/hosts` file mounted in
  a pod by kubelet is not included by the kubelet eviction manager when calculating
  ephemeral storage usage by a pod. If a pod writes a large amount of data to the
  `/etc/hosts` file, it could fill the storage space of the node and cause the node
  to fail."
