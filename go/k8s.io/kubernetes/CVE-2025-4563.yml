package_slug: "go/k8s.io/kubernetes"
title: "kubernetes allows nodes to bypass dynamic resource allocation authorization
  checks"
description: "A vulnerability exists in the NodeRestriction admission controller where
  nodes can bypass dynamic resource allocation authorization checks. When the DynamicResourceAllocation
  feature gate is enabled, the controller properly validates resource claim statuses
  during pod status updates but fails to perform equivalent validation during pod
  creation. This allows a compromised node to create mirror pods that access unauthorized
  dynamic resources, potentially leading to privilege escalation."
