title: "Kubernetes allows bypassing mountable secrets policy imposed by the ServiceAccount
  admission plugin"
description: "A security issue was discovered in Kubernetes where users may be able
  to launch containers that bypass the mountable secrets policy enforced by the ServiceAccount
  admission plugin when using containers, init containers, and ephemeral containers
  with the envFrom field populated. The policy ensures pods running with a service
  account may only reference secrets specified in the service accountâ€™s secrets field.
  Kubernetes clusters are only affected if the ServiceAccount admission plugin and
  the kubernetes.io/enforce-mountable-secrets annotation are used together with containers,
  init containers, and ephemeral containers with the envFrom field populated."
