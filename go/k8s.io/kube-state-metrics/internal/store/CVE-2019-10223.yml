package_slug: "go/k8s.io/kube-state-metrics/internal/store"
title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "A security issue was discovered in the kube-state-metrics versions v1.7.0
  and v1.7.1. An experimental feature was added to the v1.7.0 release that enabled
  annotations to be exposed as metrics. By default, the kube-state-metrics metrics
  only expose metadata about Secrets. However, a combination of the default `kubectl`
  behavior and this new feature can cause the entire secret content to end up in metric
  labels thus inadvertently exposing the secret content in metrics. This feature has
  been reverted and released as the v1.7.2 release. If you are running the v1.7.0
  or v1.7.1 release, please upgrade to the v1.7.2 release as soon as possible."
