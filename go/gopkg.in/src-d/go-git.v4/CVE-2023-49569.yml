title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "A path traversal vulnerability was discovered in go-git versions prior
  to v5.11. This vulnerability allows an attacker to create and amend files across
  the filesystem. In the worse case scenario, remote code execution could be achieved.\n\nApplications
  are only affected if they are using the ChrootOS https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-git/go-billy/v5/osfs#ChrootOS,
  which is the default when using \"Plain\" versions of Open and Clone funcs (e.g.
  PlainClone). Applications using BoundOS https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-git/go-billy/v5/osfs#BoundOS
   or in-memory filesystems are not affected by this issue.\nThis is a go-git implementation
  issue and does not affect the upstream git cli.\n\n\n"
