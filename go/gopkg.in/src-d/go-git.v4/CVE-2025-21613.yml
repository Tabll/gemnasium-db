title: "go-git has an Argument Injection via the URL field"
description: "An argument injection vulnerability was discovered in `go-git` versions
  prior to `v5.13`.\n\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an
  attacker to set arbitrary values to [git-upload-pack flags](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-upload-pack).
  This only happens when the `file` transport protocol is being used, as that is the
  only protocol that shells out to `git` binaries."
