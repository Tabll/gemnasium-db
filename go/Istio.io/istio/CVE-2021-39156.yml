package_slug: "go/Istio.io/istio"
title: "Incorrect Authorization"
description: "Istio is an open source platform for providing a uniform way to integrate
  microservices, manage traffic flow across microservices, enforce policies and aggregate
  telemetry data. Istio 1.11.0, 1.10.3 and below, and 1.9.7 and below contain a remotely
  exploitable vulnerability where an HTTP request with `#fragment` in the path may
  bypass Istioâ€™s URI path based authorization policies. Patches are available in
  Istio 1.11.1, Istio 1.10.4 and Istio 1.9.8. As a work around a Lua filter may be
  written to normalize the path."
