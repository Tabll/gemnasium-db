title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "teler is an real-time intrusion detection and threat alert dashboard.
  teler prior to version 2.0.0-rc.4 is vulnerable to DOM-based cross-site scripting
  (XSS) in the teler dashboard. When teler requests messages from the event stream
  on the `/events` endpoint, the log data displayed on the dashboard are not sanitized.
  This only affects authenticated users and can only be exploited based on detected
  threats if the log contains a DOM scripting payload. This vulnerability has been
  fixed on version `v2.0.0-rc.4`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
  workarounds for this vulnerability."
