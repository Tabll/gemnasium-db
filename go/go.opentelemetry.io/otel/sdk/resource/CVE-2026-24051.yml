title: "OpenTelemetry Go SDK Vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution via PATH Hijacking"
description: "The OpenTelemetry Go SDK in version `v1.20.0`-`1.39.0` is vulnerable
  to Path Hijacking (Untrusted Search Paths) on macOS/Darwin systems. The resource
  detection code in `sdk/resource/host_id.go` executes the `ioreg` system command
  using a search path. An attacker with the ability to locally modify the PATH environment
  variable can achieve Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE) within the context of the application."
