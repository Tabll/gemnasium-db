title: "gRPC-Go HTTP/2 Rapid Reset vulnerability"
description: "In affected releases of gRPC-Go, it is possible for an attacker to send
  HTTP/2 requests, cancel them, and send subsequent requests, which is valid by the
  HTTP/2 protocol, but would cause the gRPC-Go server to launch more concurrent method
  handlers than the configured maximum stream limit."
