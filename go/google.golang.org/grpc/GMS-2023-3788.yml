title: "gRPC-Go HTTP/2 Rapid Reset vulnerability"
description: "### Impact\nIn affected releases of gRPC-Go, it is possible for an attacker
  to send HTTP/2 requests, cancel them, and send subsequent requests, which is valid
  by the HTTP/2 protocol, but would cause the gRPC-Go server to launch more concurrent
  method handlers than the configured maximum stream limit.\n\n### Patches\nThis vulnerability
  was addressed by #6703 and has been included in patch releases: 1.56.3, 1.57.1,
  1.58.3. It is also included in the latest release, 1.59.0.\n\nAlong with applying
  the patch, users should also ensure they are using the `grpc.MaxConcurrentStreams`
  server option to apply a limit to the server's resources used for any single connection.\n\n###
  Workarounds\nNone.\n\n### References\n#6703\n"
