title: "secrets-store-sync-controller discloses service account tokens in logs"
description: "Hello Kubernetes Community,\n\nA security issue was discovered in secrets-store-sync-controller
  where an actor with access to the controller logs could observe service account
  tokens.  These tokens could then potentially be exchanged with external cloud providers
  to access secrets stored in cloud vault solutions.  Tokens are only logged when
  there is a specific error marshaling the `parameters` sent to the providers."
