package_slug: "go/sigs.k8s.io/secrets-store-csi-driver"
title: "secrets-store-csi-driver discloses service account tokens in logs"
description: "A security issue was discovered in secrets-store-csi-driver where an
  actor with access to the driver logs could observe service account tokens. These
  tokens could then potentially be exchanged with external cloud providers to access
  secrets stored in cloud vault solutions. Tokens are only logged when [TokenRequests
  is configured in the CSIDriver object](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/token-requests.html)
  and the driver is set to run at log level 2 or greater via the -v flag.\n\n\nThis
  issue has been rated MEDIUM [. and assigned CVE-2023-2878\n\n\n### Am I vulnerable?\n\nYou
  may be vulnerable if [TokenRequests is configured in the CSIDriver object](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/token-requests.html)
  and the driver is set to run at log level 2 or greater via the -v flag.\n\n\nTo
  check if token requests are configured, run the following command:\n\n```bash\nkubectl
  get csidriver secrets-store.csi.k8s.io -o jsonpath=\"{.spec.tokenRequests}\"\n```\n\nTo
  check if tokens are being logged, examine the secrets-store container log:\n\n```bash\nkubectl
  logs -l app=secrets-store-csi-driver -c secrets-store -f | grep --line-buffered
  \"csi.storage.k8s.io/serviceAccount.tokens\"\n```\n\n### Affected Versions\n\n-
  secrets-store-csi-driver < 1.3.3\n\n\n### How do I mitigate this vulnerability?\n\nPrior
  to upgrading, this vulnerability can be mitigated by running secrets-store-csi-driver
  at log level 0 or 1 via the -v flag.\n\n\n### Fixed Versions\n\n\n- secrets-store-csi-driver
  >= 1.3.3\n\n\nTo upgrade, refer to the documentation: https://secrets-store-csi-driver.sigs.k8s.io/getting-started/upgrades.html#upgrades\n\n\n###
  Detection\n\n\nExamine cloud provider logs for unexpected token exchanges, as well
  as unexpected access to cloud vault secrets.\n\n\nIf you find evidence that this
  vulnerability has been exploited, please contact [security@kubernetes.io](https://groups.google.com/)\n\n\n###
  Acknowledgements\n\n\nThis vulnerability was reported by Tomer Shaiman @tshaiman
