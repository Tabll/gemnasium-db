title: "secrets-store-csi-driver discloses service account tokens in logs"
description: "A security issue was discovered in secrets-store-csi-driver where an
  actor with access to the driver logs could observe service account tokens.  These
  tokens could then potentially be exchanged with external cloud providers to access
  secrets stored in cloud vault solutions.  Tokens are only logged when [TokenRequests
  is configured in the CSIDriver object](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/token-requests.html)
  and the driver is set to run at log level 2 or greater via the -v flag.\n"
