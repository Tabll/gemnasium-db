title: "apko has a path traversal in apko dirFS which allows filesystem writes outside
  base"
description: "A Path Traversal vulnerability was discovered in apko's dirFS filesystem
  abstraction. An attacker who can supply a malicious APK package (e.g., via a compromised
  or typosquatted repository) could create directories or symlinks outside the intended
  installation root. The MkdirAll, Mkdir, and Symlink methods in pkg/apk/fs/rwosfs.go
  use filepath.Join() without validating that the resulting path stays within the
  base directory.\n\n**Fix:** Fixed by [d8b7887](https://github.com/chainguard-dev/apko/commit/d8b7887a968a527791b3c591ae83928cb49a9f14).
  Merged into release.\n\n**Acknowledgements**\n\napko thanks Oleh Konko from [1seal](https://1seal.org/)
  for discovering and reporting this issue."
