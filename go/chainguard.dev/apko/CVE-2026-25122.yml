title: "apko affected by unbounded resource consumption in expandapk.Split on attacker-controlled
  .apk streams "
description: "`expandapk.Split` drains the first gzip stream of an APK archive via
  `io.Copy(io.Discard, gzi)` without explicit bounds. With an attacker-controlled
  input stream, this can force large gzip inflation work and lead to resource exhaustion
  (availability impact).\n\nThe `Split` function reads the first tar header, then
  drains the remainder of the gzip stream by reading from the gzip reader directly
  without any maximum uncompressed byte limit or inflate-ratio cap. A caller that
  parses attacker-controlled APK streams may be forced to spend excessive CPU time
  inflating gzip data, leading to timeouts or process slowdown.\n\n**Fix:** Fixed
  with [2be3903](https://github.com/chainguard-dev/apko/commit/2be3903fe194ad46351840f0569b35f5ac965f09),
  Released in v1.1.0.\n\n**Acknowledgements**\n\napko thanks Oleh Konko from [1seal](https://1seal.org/)
  for discovering and reporting this issue."
