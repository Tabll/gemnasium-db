title: "melange affected by potential host command execution via license-check YAML
  mode patch pipeline "
description: "An attacker who can influence inputs to the patch pipeline could execute
  arbitrary shell commands on the build host. The patch pipeline in pkg/build/pipelines/patch.yaml
  embeds input-derived values (series paths, patch filenames, and numeric parameters)
  into shell scripts without proper quoting or validation, allowing shell metacharacters
  to break out of their intended context.\n\nThe vulnerability affects the built-in
  patch pipeline which can be invoked through melange build and melange license-check
  operations. An attacker who can control patch-related inputs (e.g., through pull
  request-driven CI, build-as-a-service, or by influencing melange configurations)
  can inject shell metacharacters such as backticks, command substitutions  $(…),
  semicolons, pipes, or redirections to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges
  of the melange build process."
