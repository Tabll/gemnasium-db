title: "melange has a path traversal in license-path which allows reading files outside
  workspace "
description: "An attacker who can influence a melange configuration file (e.g., through
  pull request-driven CI or build-as-a-service scenarios) could read arbitrary files
  from the host system. The `LicensingInfos` function in `pkg/config/config.go` reads
  license files specified in `copyright[].license-path` without validating that paths
  remain within the workspace directory, allowing path traversal via `../` sequences.
  The contents of the traversed file are embedded into the generated SBOM as license
  text, enabling exfiltration of sensitive data through build artifacts.\n\nFix: Merged
  in commit 2f95c9f4\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nmelange thanks Oleh Konko (@1seal) from
  1seal for discovering and reporting this issue."
