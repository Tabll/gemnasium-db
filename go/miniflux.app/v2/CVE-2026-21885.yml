title: "Miniflux Media Proxy SSRF via /proxy endpoint allows access to internal network
  resources"
description: "Miniflux's media proxy endpoint (`GET /proxy/{encodedDigest}/{encodedURL}`)
  can be abused to perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). An authenticated user
  can cause Miniflux to generate a signed proxy URL for attacker-chosen media URLs
  embedded in feed entry content, including internal addresses (e.g., localhost, private
  RFC1918 ranges, or link-local metadata endpoints). Requesting the resulting `/proxy/...`
  URL makes Miniflux fetch and return the internal response."
