package_slug: "go/sftpgo"
title: "SFTPGo allows administrators to restrict command execution from the EventManager"
description: "One powerful feature of SFTPGo is the ability to have the EventManager
  execute scripts or run applications in response to certain events.\nThis feature
  is very common in all software similar to SFTPGo and is generally unrestricted.\n\nHowever,
  any SFTPGo administrator with permission to run a script has access to the underlying
  OS/container with the same permissions as the user running SFTPGo, so they can access
  the database and server configurations.\n\nThis is unexpected for some SFTPGo administrators
  who think that there is a clear distinction between accessing the system shell and
  accessing the SFTPGo WebAdmin UI."
