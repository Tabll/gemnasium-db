package_slug: "go/helm.sh/helm"
title: "Use of Multiple Resources with Duplicate Identifier"
description: "In Helm before versions 2.16.11 and 3.3.2, a Helm repository can contain
  duplicates of the same chart, with the last one always used. If a repository is
  compromised, this lowers the level of access that an attacker needs to inject a
  bad chart into a repository. To perform this attack, an attacker must have write
  access to the index file (which can occur during a MITM attack on a non-SSL connection).
  This issue has been patched in Helm 3.3.2 and 2.16.11. A possible workaround is
  to manually review the index file in the Helm repository cache before installing
  software."
