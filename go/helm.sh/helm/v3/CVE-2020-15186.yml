package_slug: "go/helm.sh/helm/v3"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream
  Component ('Injection')"
description: "In Helm before versions 2.16.11 and 3.3.2 plugin names are not sanitized
  properly. As a result, a malicious plugin author could use characters in a plugin
  name that would result in unexpected behavior, such as duplicating the name of another
  plugin or spoofing the output to `helm --help`. This issue has been patched in Helm
  3.3.2. A possible workaround is to not install untrusted Helm plugins. Examine the
  `name` field in the `plugin.yaml` file for a plugin, looking for characters outside
  of the [a-zA-Z0-9._-] range."
