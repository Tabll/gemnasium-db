package_slug: "go/helm.sh/helm/v3"
title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "Helm is a tool for managing Charts (packages of pre-configured Kubernetes
  resources). In versions of helm prior to 3.6.1, a vulnerability exists where the
  username and password credentials associated with a Helm repository could be passed
  on to another domain referenced by that Helm repository. This issue has been resolved
  in 3.6.1. There is a workaround through which one may check for improperly passed
  credentials. One may use a username and password for a Helm repository and may audit
  the Helm repository in order to check for another domain being used that could have
  received the credentials. In the `index.yaml` file for that repository, one may
  look for another domain in the `urls` list for the chart versions. If there is another
  domain found and that chart version was pulled or installed, the credentials would
  be passed on."
