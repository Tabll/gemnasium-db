package_slug: "go/helm.sh/helm/v3"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command
  Injection')"
description: "In Helm before versions 2.16.11 and 3.3.2, a Helm plugin can contain
  duplicates of the same entry, with the last one always used. If a plugin is compromised,
  this lowers the level of access that an attacker needs to modify a plugin's install
  hooks, causing a local execution attack. To perform this attack, an attacker must
  have write access to the git repository or plugin archive (.tgz) while being downloaded
  (which can occur during a MITM attack on a non-SSL connection). This issue has been
  patched in Helm 2.16.11 and Helm 3.3.2. As a possible workaround make sure to install
  plugins using a secure connection protocol like SSL."
