package_slug: "go/helm.sh/helm/v3"
title: "plugin.yaml file allows for duplicate entries in helm"
description: "During a security audit of Helm's code base, Helm maintainers identified
  a bug in which a Helm plugin can contain duplicates of the same entry, with the
  last one always used. If a plugin is compromised, this lowers the level of access
  that an attacker needs to modify a plugin's install hooks, causing a local execution
  attack.\n\nTo perform this attack, an attacker must have write access to the git
  repository or plugin archive (.tgz) while being downloaded (which can occur during
  a MITM attack on a non-SSL connection)."
