package_slug: "go/helm.sh/helm/v3"
title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "Helm is a tool for managing Charts. Charts are packages of pre-configured
  Kubernetes resources. When either the Helm client or SDK is used to save a chart
  whose name within the `Chart.yaml` file includes a relative path change, the chart
  would be saved outside its expected directory based on the changes in the relative
  path. The validation and linting does not detect the path changes in the name. This
  issue has been resolved in Helm v3.14.1. Users unable to upgrade should check all
  charts used by Helm for path changes in their name as found in the `Chart.yaml`
  file. This includes dependencies."
