package_slug: "go/helm.sh/helm/v3/pkg/chartutil"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream
  Component ('Injection')"
description: "In Helm before versions 2.16.11 and 3.3.2 there is a bug in which the
  `alias` field on a `Chart.yaml` is not properly sanitized. This could lead to the
  injection of unwanted information into a chart. This issue has been patched in Helm
  3.3.2 and 2.16.11. A possible workaround is to manually review the `dependencies`
  field of any untrusted chart, verifying that the `alias` field is either not used,
  or (if used) does not contain newlines or path characters."
