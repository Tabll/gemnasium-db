title: "Duplicate Advisory: Helm passes repository credentials to alternate domain"
description: "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-56hp-xqp3-w2jf. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n## Original Description\nHelm is a tool for managing Charts (packages
  of pre-configured Kubernetes resources). In versions of helm prior to 3.6.1, a vulnerability
  exists where the username and password credentials associated with a Helm repository
  could be passed on to another domain referenced by that Helm repository. This issue
  has been resolved in 3.6.1. There is a workaround through which one may check for
  improperly passed credentials. One may use a username and password for a Helm repository
  and may audit the Helm repository in order to check for another domain being used
  that could have received the credentials. In the `index.yaml` file for that repository,
  one may look for another domain in the `urls` list for the chart versions. If there
  is another domain found and that chart version was pulled or installed, the credentials
  would be passed on."
