package_slug: "go/helm.sh/helm/v3"
title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "Helm is a tool that streamlines installing and managing Kubernetes applications.`getHostByName`
  is a Helm template function introduced in Helm v3. The function is able to accept
  a hostname and return an IP address for that hostname. To get the IP address the
  function performs a DNS lookup. The DNS lookup happens when used with `helm install|upgrade|template`
  or when the Helm SDK is used to render a chart. Information passed into the chart
  can be disclosed to the DNS servers used to lookup the IP address. For example,
  a malicious chart could inject `getHostByName` into a chart in order to disclose
  values to a malicious DNS server. The issue has been fixed in Helm 3.11.1. Prior
  to using a chart with Helm verify the `getHostByName` function is not being used
  in a template to disclose any information you do not want passed to DNS servers."
