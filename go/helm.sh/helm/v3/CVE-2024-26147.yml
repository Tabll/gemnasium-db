title: "Use of Uninitialized Variable"
description: "Helm is a package manager for Charts for Kubernetes. Versions prior
  to 3.14.2 contain an uninitialized variable vulnerability when Helm parses index
  and plugin yaml files missing expected content. When either an `index.yaml` file
  or a plugins `plugin.yaml` file were missing all metadata a panic would occur in
  Helm. In the Helm SDK, this is found when using the `LoadIndexFile` or `DownloadIndexFile`
  functions in the `repo` package or the `LoadDir` function in the `plugin` package.
  For the Helm client this impacts functions around adding a repository and all Helm
  functions if a malicious plugin is added as Helm inspects all known plugins on each
  invocation. This issue has been resolved in Helm v3.14.2. If a malicious plugin
  has been added which is causing all Helm client commands to panic, the malicious
  plugin can be manually removed from the filesystem. If using Helm SDK versions prior
  to 3.14.2, calls to affected functions can use `recover` to catch the panic."
