title: "Helm shows secrets in clear text"
description: "An issue was discovered in Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)
  Helm. It displays values of secrets when the --dry-run flag is used. This is a security
  concern in some use cases, such as a --dry-run call by a CI/CD tool. NOTE: the vendor's
  position is that this behavior was introduced intentionally, and cannot be removed
  without breaking backwards compatibility (some users may be relying on these values)."
