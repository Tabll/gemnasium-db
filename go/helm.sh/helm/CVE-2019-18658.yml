description: "In Helm 2.x before 2.15.2, commands that deal with loading a chart as
  a directory or packaging a chart provide an opportunity for a maliciously designed
  chart to include sensitive content such as /etc/passwd, or to execute a denial of
  service (DoS) via a special file such as /dev/urandom, via symlinks. No version
  of Tiller is known to be impacted. This is a client-only issue."
