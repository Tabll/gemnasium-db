package_slug: "go/www.velocidex.com/golang/velociraptor"
title: "Velociraptor vulnerable to privilege escalation via UpdateConfig artifact"
description: "Velociraptor allows collection of VQL queries packaged into Artifacts
  from endpoints. These artifacts can be used to do anything and usually run with
  elevated permissions.Â  To limit access to some dangerous artifact, Velociraptor
  allows for those to require high permissions like EXECVE to launch.\n\nThe Admin.Client.UpdateClientConfig
  is an artifact used to update the client's configuration. This artifact did not
  enforce an additional required permission, allowing users with COLLECT_CLIENT permissions
  (normally given by the \"Investigator\" role) to collect it from endpoints and update
  the configuration.\n\nThis can lead to arbitrary command execution and endpoint
  takeover.\n\nTo successfully exploit this vulnerability the user must already have
  access to collect artifacts from the endpoint (i.e. have the COLLECT_CLIENT given
  typically by the \"Investigator' role)."
