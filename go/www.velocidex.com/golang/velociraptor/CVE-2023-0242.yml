package_slug: "go/www.velocidex.com/golang/velociraptor"
title: "Missing Authorization"
description: "Rapid7 Velociraptor allows users to be created with different privileges
  on the server. Administrators are generally allowed to run any command on the server
  including writing arbitrary files. However, lower privilege users are generally
  forbidden from writing or modifying files on the server. The VQL copy() function
  applies permission checks for reading files but does not check for permission to
  write files. This allows a low privilege user (usually, users with the Velociraptor
  \"investigator\" role) to overwrite files on the server, including Velociraptor
  configuration files. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must already have
  a Velociraptor user account at a low privilege level (at least \"analyst\") and
  be able to log into the GUI and create a notebook where they can run the VQL query
  invoking the copy() VQL function. Typically, most users deploy Velociraptor with
  limited access to a trusted group (most users will be administrators within the
  GUI). This vulnerability is associated with program files https://github.Com/Velocidex/velociraptor/blob/master/vql/filesystem/copy.go
  https://github.Com/Velocidex/velociraptor/blob/master/vql/filesystem/copy.go and
  program routines copy(). This issue affects Velociraptor versions before 0.6.7-5.
  Version 0.6.7-5, released January 16, 2023, fixes the issue."
