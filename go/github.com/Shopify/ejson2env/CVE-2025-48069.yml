package_slug: "go/github.com/Shopify/ejson2env"
title: "Insufficient input sanitization in ejson2env "
description: "The `ejson2env` tool has a vulnerability related to how it writes to
  `stdout`. Specifically, the tool is intended to write an export statement for environment
  variables and their values. However, due to inadequate output sanitization, there
  is a potential risk where variable names or values may include malicious content,
  resulting in additional unintended commands being output to `stdout`. If this output
  is improperly utilized in further command execution, it could lead to command injection
  vulnerabilities, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host
  system."
