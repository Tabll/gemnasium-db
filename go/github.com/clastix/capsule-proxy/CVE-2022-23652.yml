title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "capsule-proxy is a reverse proxy for Capsule Operator which provides
  multi-tenancy in Kubernetes. In versions prior to 0.2.1 an attacker with a proper
  authentication mechanism may use a malicious `Connection` header to start a privilege
  escalation attack towards the Kubernetes API Server. This vulnerability allows for
  an exploit of the `cluster-admin` Role bound to `capsule-proxy`. There are no known
  workarounds for this issue."
