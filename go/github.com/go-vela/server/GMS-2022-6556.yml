title: "Duplicate of ./go/github.com/go-vela/server/CVE-2022-39395.yml"
description: "Some current default configurations for Vela allow exploitation and
  container breakouts. Running Vela plugins as privileged Docker containers allows
  a malicious user to easily break out of the container and gain access to the worker
  host operating system. On a fresh install of Vela without any additional configuration,
  the `target/vela-docker` plugin will run as a privileged container, even if the
  Vela administrators did not intend to allow for any privileged plugins, and even
  if the vela.yml configuration file does not use the `privileged = True` flag. Privileged
  containers permit trivial breakouts, which can pose significant risk to the environment
  in which Vela is running."
