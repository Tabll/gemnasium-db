title: "Harvest May Expose OS Default SSH Login Password Via SUSE Virtualization Interactive
  Installer"
description: "Projects using the SUSE Virtualization (Harvester) environment are vulnerable
  to this exploit if they are using the 1.5.x or 1.6.x interactive installer to either
  create a new cluster or add new hosts to an existing cluster.  The environment is
  not affected if the [PXE boot mechanism](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.7/install/pxe-boot-install/)
  is utilized along with the [Harvester configuration](https://docs.harvesterhci.
  io/v1.7/install/harvester-configuration) setup.\n\nA critical vulnerability has
  been identified within the SUSE Virtualization interactive installer. This vulnerability
  allows an attacker to gain unauthorized network access to the host via a remote
  shell (SSH).\n\nThe SUSE Virtualization operating system includes a default administrative
  login credential intended solely for out-of-band cluster management tasks (for example,
  perform troubleshooting, device management and system recovery over serial ports).
  When the interactive installer is used to create or expand a cluster, the installer
  enables the host's networking functions before the default password is reset. This
  presents a window of opportunity for an attacker to exploit the default password
  to gain unauthorized access to the host via SSH.\n\nPlease consult the associated
  \ [MITRE ATT&CK - Technique - Default Credentials](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0812/)
  for further information about this category of attack."
