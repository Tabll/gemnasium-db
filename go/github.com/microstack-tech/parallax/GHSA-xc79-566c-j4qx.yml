title: "Parallax is vulnerable to DoS via malicious p2p message"
description: "A vulnerable node can be made to consume very large amounts of memory
  when handling specially crafted p2p messages sent from an attacker node.\n\nIn order
  to carry out the attack, the attacker establishes a peer connections to the victim,
  and sends a malicious `GetBlockHeadersRequest` message with a `count` of `0`, using
  the `Parallax` protocol.\n\nIn `descendants := chain.GetHeadersFrom(num+count-1,
  count-1)`, the value of `count-1` is passed to the function `GetHeadersFrom(number,
  count uint64)` as parameter `count`. Due to integer overflow, `UINT64_MAX` value
  is then passed as the `count` argument to function `GetHeadersFrom(number, count
  uint64)`. This allows an attacker to bypass `maxHeadersServe` and request all headers
  from the latest block back to the genesis block."
