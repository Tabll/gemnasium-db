title: "Talos Linux ships runc vulnerable to the escape to the host attack"
description: "### Impact\n\nSnyk has discovered a vulnerability in all versions of
  runc <=1.1.11, as used by the Docker engine, along with other containerization technologies
  such as Kubernetes. Exploitation of this issue can result in container escape to
  the underlying host OS, either through executing a malicious image or building an
  image using a malicious Dockerfile or upstream image (i.e., when using FROM). This
  issue has been assigned the CVE-2024-21626.\n\n### Patches\n\n`runc` runtime was
  updated to 1.1.12 in Talos v1.5.6 and v1.6.4.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nInspect the
  workloads running on the cluster to make sure they are not trying to exploit the
  vulnerability.\n\n### References\n\n* [CVE-2024-21626](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-xr7r-f8xq-vfvv)\n*
