title: "nftables binding to an already bound chain"
description: "### Impact\nAn issue was discovered in net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c
  in the Linux kernel. A denial of service can occur upon binding to an already bound
  chain.\n\nAffected by this vulnerability is the function nft_verdict_init of the
  file net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c. The manipulation with an unknown input leads
  to a denial of service vulnerability. The program does not release or incorrectly
  releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n### Patches\nThe
  fix has been backported to [5.15.64](https://www.linuxkernelcves.com/cves/CVE-2022-39190)
  version of the upstream Linux kernel (5.15 is the upstream Kernel long term version
  Talos ships with). Talos >= v1.2.0 is shipped with Linux Kernel 5.15.64 fixing the
  above issue.\n\n### Workarounds\nIt's recommended to upgrade\n\n### References\n-
