- "GHSA-hqrf-67pm-wgfq"
package_slug: "go/github.com/siderolabs/omni"
title: "Omni Wireguard SideroLink potential escape"
description: "This vulnerability creates two distinct attack scenarios based on Omni's
  `IP forwarding` configuration.\n\n1.  **IP Forwarding Disabled (Default)**\nIf `IP
  forwarding` is disabled, an attacker on a Talos machine can send packets over SideroLink
  to any listening service on Omni itself (e.g., an internal API). If Omni is running
  in host networking mode, any service on the host machine could also be targeted.
  While this is the default configuration, Omni does not enforce it.\n\n2.  **IP Forwarding
  Enabled**\nIf `IP forwarding` is enabled, an attacker on a Talos machine can communicate
  with other machines connected to Omni or route packets deeper into Omni's network.
  Although this is not the default configuration, Omni does not check for or prevent
  this state."
