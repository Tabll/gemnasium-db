title: "Insufficiently Protected Credentials"
description: "Dex is an identity service that uses OpenID Connect to drive authentication
  for other apps. Dex instances with public clients (and by extension, clients accepting
  tokens issued by those Dex instances) are affected by this vulnerability if they
  are running a version prior to 2.35.0. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability
  by making a victim navigate to a malicious website and guiding them through the
  OIDC flow, stealing the OAuth authorization code in the process. The authorization
  code then can be exchanged by the attacker for a token, gaining access to applications
  accepting that token. Version 2.35.0 has introduced a fix for this issue. Users
  are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue."
