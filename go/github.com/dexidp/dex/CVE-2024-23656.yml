title: "Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')"
description: "Dex is an identity service that uses OpenID Connect to drive authentication
  for other apps. Dex 2.37.0 serves HTTPS with insecure TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1. `cmd/dex/serve.go`
  line 425 seemingly sets TLS 1.2 as minimum version, but the whole `tlsConfig` is
  ignored after `TLS cert reloader` was introduced in v2.37.0. Configured cipher suites
  are not respected either. This issue is fixed in Dex 2.38.0."
