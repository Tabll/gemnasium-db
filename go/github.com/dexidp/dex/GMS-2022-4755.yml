title: "Duplicate of ./go/github.com/dexidp/dex/CVE-2022-39222.yml"
description: "Dex instances with public clients (and by extension, clients accepting
  tokens issued by those Dex instances) are affected by this vulnerability. An attacker
  can exploit this vulnerability by making a victim navigate to a malicious website
  and guiding them through the OIDC flow, stealing the OAuth authorization code in
  the process. The authorization code then can be exchanged by the attacker for a
  token, gaining access to applications accepting that token. Patches: Update to 2.35.0.
  Workarounds: No known workarounds (without impacting behavior) for existing versions.
  Disabling public clients is the only way to defend against attacks exploiting this
  vulnerability."
