title: "CoreDNS Vulnerable to DoQ Memory Exhaustion via Stream Amplification"
description: "A **Denial of Service (DoS)** vulnerability was discovered in the CoreDNS
  DNS-over-QUIC (DoQ) server implementation. The server previously created a new goroutine
  for every incoming QUIC stream without imposing any limits on the number of concurrent
  streams or goroutines. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could open a large number
  of streams, leading to uncontrolled memory consumption and eventually causing an
  Out Of Memory (OOM) crash â€” especially in containerized or memory-constrained environments."
