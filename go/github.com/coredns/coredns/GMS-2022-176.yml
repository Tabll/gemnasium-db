title: "Improper random number generation in github.com/coredns/coredns"
description: "### Impact\n\nCoreDNS before 1.6.6 (using go DNS package < 1.1.25) improperly
  generates random numbers because math/rand is used. The TXID becomes predictable,
  leading to response forgeries.\n\n### Patches\nThe problem has been fixed in 1.6.6+.\n\n###
  References\n- [CVE-2019-19794](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-19794)\n\n###
