title: "Prometheus vulnerable to basic authentication bypass"
description: "Prometheus can be secured by a web.yml file that specifies usernames 
  and hashed passwords for basic authentication. Passwords are hashed with bcrypt, 
  which means that even if you have access to the hash, it is very hard to find the 
  original password back.
  However, a flaw in the way this mechanism was implemented in the exporter toolkit
  makes it possible with people who know the hashed password to authenticate against 
  Prometheus.
  A request can be forged by an attacker to poison the internal cache used to cache 
  the computation of hashes and make subsequent requests successful. This cache is 
  used in both happy and unhappy scenarios in order to limit side channel attacks 
  that could tell an attacker if a user is present in the file or not."
