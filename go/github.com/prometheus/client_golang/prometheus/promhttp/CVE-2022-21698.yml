package_slug: "go/github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus/promhttp"
title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "client_golang's HTTP server is susceptible to a Denial of Service 
  through unbounded cardinality, and potential memory exhaustion, when handling 
  requests with non-standard HTTP methods. In order to be affected, an instrumented 
  software must use any of `promhttp.InstrumentHandler*` middleware except 
  `RequestsInFlight`; not filter any specific methods (e.g GET) before middleware; 
  pass metric with `method` label name to our middleware; and not have any 
  firewall/LB/proxy that filters away requests with unknown `method`. 
  Several workarounds are available, including removing the `method` label name 
  from counter/gauge used in the InstrumentHandler; turning off affected promhttp 
  handlers; adding custom middleware before promhttp handler that will sanitize 
  the request method given by Go http.Request; and using a reverse proxy or web 
  application firewall, configured to only allow a limited set of methods."
