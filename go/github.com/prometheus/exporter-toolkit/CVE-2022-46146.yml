package_slug: "go/github.com/prometheus/exporter-toolkit"
title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "Prometheus Exporter Toolkit is a utility package to build exporters.
  Prior to versions 0.7.2 and 0.8.2, if someone has access to a Prometheus web.yml
  file and users' bcrypted passwords, they can bypass security by poisoning the built-in
  authentication cache. Versions 0.7.2 and 0.8.2 contain a fix for the issue. There
  is no workaround, but attacker must have access to the hashed password to use this
  functionality."
