title: "Eclipse Paho Go MQTT may incorrectly encode strings if length exceeds 65535
  bytes"
description: "In Eclipse Paho Go MQTT v3.1 library (paho.mqtt.golang) versions <=1.5.0
  UTF-8 encoded strings, passed into the library, may be incorrectly encoded if their
  length exceeds 65535 bytes. This may lead to unexpected content in packets sent
  to the server (for example, part of an MQTT topic may leak into the message body
  in a PUBLISH packet).\n\nThe issue arises because the length of the data passed
  in was converted from an int64/int32 (depending upon CPU) to an int16 without checks
  for overflows. The int16 length was then written, followed by the data (e.g. topic).
  This meant that when the data (e.g. topic) was over 65535 bytes then the amount
  of data written exceeds what the length field indicates. This could lead to a corrupt
  packet, or mean that the excess data leaks into another field (e.g. topic leaks
  into message body)."
