title: "Relative Path Traversal"
description: "A flaw was found in the decompression function of registry-support.
  This issue can be triggered if an unauthenticated remote attacker tricks a user
  into parsing a devfile which uses the `parent` or `plugin` keywords. This could
  download a malicious archive and cause the cleanup process to overwrite or delete
  files outside of the archive, which should not be allowed."
