package_slug: "go/github.com/istio/istio"
title: "Incorrect Authorization"
description: "Istio is an open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices.
  Istio is vulnerable to a privilege escalation attack. Users who have `CREATE` permission
  for `gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io` objects can escalate this privilege to
  create other resources that they may not have access to, such as `Pod`. This vulnerability
  impacts only an Alpha level feature, the Kubernetes Gateway API. This is not the
  same as the Istio Gateway type (gateways.networking.istio.io), which is not vulnerable.
  Users are advised to upgrade to resolve this issue. Users unable to upgrade should
  implement any of the following which will prevent this vulnerability: Remove the
  gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io CustomResourceDefinition, set PILOT_ENABLE_GATEWAY_API_DEPLOYMENT_CONTROLLER=true
  environment variable in Istiod, or remove CREATE permissions for gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io
  objects from untrusted users."
