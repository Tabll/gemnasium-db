description: "Istio is an open source platform for providing a uniform way to integrate
  microservices, manage traffic flow across microservices, enforce policies and aggregate
  telemetry data. Istio contains a remotely exploitable vulnerability where an HTTP

  policies. As a work around a Lua filter may be written to normalize the path."
