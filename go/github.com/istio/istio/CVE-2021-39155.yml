identifier: "CVE-2021-39155"
package_slug: "go/github.com/istio/istio"
title: "Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity"
description: "Istio is an open source platform for providing a uniform way to integrate
  microservices, manage traffic flow across microservices, enforce policies and aggregate
  telemetry data. According to [RFC ](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4343),
  Istio authorization policy should compare the hostname in the HTTP Host header in
  a case insensitive way, but currently the comparison is case sensitive. The proxy
  will route the request hostname in a case-insensitive way which means the authorization
  policy could be bypassed. As an example, the user may have an authorization policy
  that rejects request with hostname \"httpbin.foo\" for some source IPs, but the
  attacker can bypass this by sending the request with hostname \"Httpbin.Foo\". Patches
  are available in Istio, Istio and Istio As a work around a Lua filter may be written
  to normalize Host header before the authorization check. This is similar to the
  Path normalization presented in the [Security Best Practices]
  (https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/best-practices/security/#case-normalization)
  guide."
