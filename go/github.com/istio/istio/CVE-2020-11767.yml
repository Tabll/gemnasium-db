identifier: "CVE-2020-11767"
package_slug: "go/github.com/istio/istio"
title: "Information Exposure"
description: "Istio has a data-leak issue. If there is a TCP connection (negotiated
  with SNI over HTTPS) to `*.example.com`, a request for a domain concurrently configured
  explicitly (e.g., `abc.example.com`) is sent to the server(s) listening behind `*.example.com`.
  The outcome should instead be Misdirected Request. Imagine a shared caching forward
  proxy re-using an HTTP/2 connection for a large subnet with many users."
