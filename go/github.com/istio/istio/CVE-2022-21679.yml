title: "Always-Incorrect Control Flow Implementation"
description: "Istio is an open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices.
  In Istio The authorization policy with hosts and notHosts might be accidentally
  bypassed for ALLOW action or rejected unexpectedly for DENY action during the upgrade
  from to /1.12.1. Istio supports the hosts and notHosts fields in authorization policy
  with a new Envoy API shipped with the data plane. A bug in the incorrectly uses
  the new Envoy API with the data plane. This will cause the hosts and notHosts fields
  to be always matched regardless of the actual value of the host header when mixing
  /1.12.1 control plane data plane. Users are advised to upgrade or to not mix the
  /1.12.1 control plane with data plane if using hosts or notHosts field in authorization
  policy."
