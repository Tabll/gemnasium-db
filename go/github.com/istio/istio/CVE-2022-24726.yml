title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "Istio is an open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices.
  In affected versions the Istio control plane, istiod, is vulnerable to a request
  processing error, allowing a malicious attacker that sends a specially crafted message
  which results in the control plane crashing when the validating webhook for a cluster
  is exposed publicly. This endpoint is served over TLS port 15017, but does not require
  any authentication from the attacker. For simple installations, Istiod is typically
  only reachable from within the cluster, limiting the blast radius. However, for
  some deployments, especially [external istiod](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/external-controlplane/)
  topologies, this port is exposed over the public internet. This issue has been patched
  in versions 1.13.2, 1.12.5 and 1.11.8. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable
  to upgrade should disable access to a validating webhook that is exposed to the
  public internet or restrict the set of IP addresses that can query it to a set of
  known, trusted entities."
