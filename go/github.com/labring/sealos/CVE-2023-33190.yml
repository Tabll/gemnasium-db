title: "Incorrect Authorization"
description: "Sealos is an open source cloud operating system distribution based on
  the Kubernetes kernel. In versions of Sealos prior to 4.2.1-rc4 an improper configuration
  of role based access control (RBAC) permissions resulted in an attacker being able
  to obtain cluster control permissions, which could control the entire cluster deployed
  with Sealos, as well as hundreds of pods and other resources within the cluster.
  This issue has been addressed in version 4.2.1-rc4. Users are advised to upgrade.
  There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
