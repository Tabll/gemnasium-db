package_slug: "go/github.com/labring/sealos"
title: "Missing Authorization"
description: "Sealos is a Cloud Operating System designed for managing cloud-native
  applications. In version 4.2.0 and prior, there is a permission flaw in the Sealos
  billing system, which allows users to control the recharge resource account `sealos[.]
  io/v1/Payment`, resulting in the ability to recharge any amount of 1 renminbi (RMB).
  The charging interface may expose resource information. The namespace of this custom
  resource would be user's control and may have permission to correct it. It is not
  clear whether a fix exists."
