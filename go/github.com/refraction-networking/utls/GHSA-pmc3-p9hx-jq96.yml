title: "uTLS ServerHellos are accepted without checking TLS 1.3 downgrade canaries"
description: "Before version 1.7.0, utls did not implement the TLS 1.3 downgrade protection
  mechanism specified in RFC 8446 Section 4.1.3 when using a utls ClientHello spec.
  This allowed an active network adversary to downgrade TLS 1.3 connections initiated
  by a utls client to a lower TLS version (e.g., TLS 1.2) by modifying the ClientHello
  message to exclude the SupportedVersions extension, causing the server to respond
  with a TLS 1.2 ServerHello (along with a downgrade canary in the ServerHello random
  field). Because utls did not check the downgrade canary in the ServerHello random
  field, clients would accept the downgraded connection without detecting the attack.
  This attack could also be used by an active network attacker to fingerprint utls
  connections."
