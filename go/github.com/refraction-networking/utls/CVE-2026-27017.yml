title: "uTLS has a fingerprint vulnerability from GREASE ECH mismatch for Chrome parrots"
description: "There is a fingerprint mismatch with Chrome when using GREASE ECH, having
  to do with ciphersuite selection. When Chrome selects the preferred ciphersuite
  in the outer ClientHello and the ciphersuite for ECH, it does so consistently based
  on hardware support. That means, for example, if it prefers AES for the outer ciphersuite,
  it would also use AES for ECH. The Chrome parrot in utls hardcodes AES preference
  for outer ciphersuites but selects the ECH ciphersuite randomly between AES and
  ChaCha20. So there is a 50% chance of selecting ChaCha20 for ECH while using AES
  for the outer ciphersuite, which is impossible in Chrome.\n\nThis is only a problem
  in GREASE ECH, since in real ECH Chrome selects the first valid ciphersuite when
  AES is preferred, which is the same in utls. So no change is done there.\n\nAffected
  symbols: `HelloChrome_120`, `HelloChrome_120_PQ`, `HelloChrome_131`, `HelloChrome_133`\n\nFix
  commit: 24bd1e05a788c1add7f3037f4532ea552b2cee07\n\nThanks to telegram @acgdaily
  for reporting this issue."
