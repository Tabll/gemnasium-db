title: "uTLS has a fingerprint vulnerability from missing padding extension for Chrome
  120"
description: "The padding extension was incorrectly removed in utls for the non-pq
  variant of Chrome 120 fingerprint. Chrome removed this extension only when sending
  pq keyshares. Only this fingerprint is affected since newer fingerprints have pq
  keyshares by default and older fingerprints have this extension.\n\nAffected symbols:
  `HelloChrome_120`\n\nFix commit: 8fe0b08e9a0e7e2d08b268f451f2c79962e6acd0\n\nThanks
  to telegram @acgdaily for reporting this issue."
