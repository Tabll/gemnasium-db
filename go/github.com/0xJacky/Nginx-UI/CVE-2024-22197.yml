package_slug: "go/github.com/0xJacky/Nginx-UI"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')"
description: "Nginx-ui is online statistics for Server Indicators​​ Monitor CPU usage,
  memory usage, load average, and disk usage in real-time. The `Home > Preference`
  page exposes a small list of nginx settings such as `Nginx Access Log Path` and
  `Nginx Error Log Path`. However, the API also exposes `test_config_cmd`, `reload_cmd`
  and `restart_cmd`. While the UI does not allow users to modify any of these settings,
  it is possible to do so by sending a request to the API. This issue may lead to
  authenticated Remote Code Execution, Privilege Escalation, and Information Disclosure.
  This issue has been patched in version 2.0.0.beta.9."
