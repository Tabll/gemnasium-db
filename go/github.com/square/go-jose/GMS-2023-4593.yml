title: "Decryption of malicious PBES2 JWE objects can consume unbounded system resources"
description: "The go-jose package is subject to a \"billion hashes attack\" causing
  denial-of-service when decrypting JWE inputs. This occurs when an attacker can provide
  a PBES2 encrypted JWE blob with a very large p2c value that, when decrypted, produces
  a denial-of-service."
