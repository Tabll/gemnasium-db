package_slug: "go/github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/v2/jwe"
title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "lestrrat-go/jwx is a Go module implementing various JWx (JWA/JWE/JWK/JWS/JWT,
  otherwise known as JOSE) technologies. A p2c parameter set too high in JWE's algorithm
  PBES2-* could lead to a denial of service. The JWE key management algorithms based
  on PBKDF2 require a JOSE Header Parameter called p2c (PBES2 Count). This parameter
  dictates the number of PBKDF2 iterations needed to derive a CEK wrapping key. Its
  primary purpose is to intentionally slow down the key derivation function, making
  password brute-force and dictionary attacks more resource- intensive. Therefore,
  if an attacker sets the p2c parameter in JWE to a very large number, it can cause
  a lot of computational consumption, resulting in a denial of service. This vulnerability
  has been addressed in commit `64f2a229b` which has been included in release version
  1.2.27 and 2.0.18. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
  for this vulnerability."
