description: "### Summary\n\nDecrypting AES-CBC encrypted JWE has Potential Padding
  Oracle Attack Vulnerability.\n\n### Details\n\nOn 
  [v2.0.10](https://github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/releases/tag/v2.0.10),
  decrypting AES-CBC encrypted JWE may return an error \"failed to generate plaintext
  from decrypted blocks: invalid padding\":\n\n
  https://github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/blob/8840ffd4afc5839f591ff0e9ba9034af52b1643e/jwe/internal/aescbc/aescbc.go#L210-L213
  \n\nReporting padding error causes 
  [Padding Oracle Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padding_oracle_attack)
  Vulnerability.\nRFC 7516 JSON Web Encryption (JWE) says that we **MUST NOT** do
  this.\n\n> 11.5. Timing Attacks\n> To mitigate the attacks described in RFC 3218
  [RFC3218], the\n> recipient MUST NOT distinguish between format, padding, and length\n>
  errors of encrypted keys. It is strongly recommended, in the event\n> of receiving
  an improperly formatted key, that the recipient\n> substitute a randomly generated
  CEK and proceed to the next step, to\n> mitigate timing attacks.\n\nIn addition,
  the time to remove padding depends on the length of the padding.\nIt may leak the
  length of the padding by Timing Attacks.\n\n

  \n\nTo
  mitigate Timing Attacks, it MUST be done in constant time.\n\n### Impact\n\nThe
  authentication tag is verified, so it is not an immediate attack.\n"
