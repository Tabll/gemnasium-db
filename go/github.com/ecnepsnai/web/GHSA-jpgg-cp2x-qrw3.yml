title: "Duplicate Advisory: ecnepsnai/web vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-5gjg-jgh4-gppm. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n## Original Description\nWeb Sockets do not execute any AuthenticateMethod
  methods which may be set, leading to a nil pointer dereference if the returned UserData
  pointer is assumed to be non-nil, or authentication bypass. This issue only affects
  WebSockets with an AuthenticateMethod hook. Request handlers that do not explicitly
  use WebSockets are not vulnerable."
