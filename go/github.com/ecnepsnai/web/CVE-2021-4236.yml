title: "Websocket requests did not call AuthenticateMethod"
description: "Depending on implementation, a denial-of-service or privilege escalation
  vulnerability may occur in software that uses the `github.com/ecnepsnai/web` package
  with Web Sockets that have an AuthenticateMethod.\n\nThe `AuthenticateMethod` is
  not called, and `UserData` will be nil in request methods. Attempts to read the
  `UserData` may result in a panic.\n\nThis issue only affects web sockets where an
  `AuthenticateMethod` is supplied to the handle options. Users who do not use web
  sockets, or users who do not require authentication are not at risk."
