title: "Websocket requests did not call AuthenticateMethod"
description: "### Impact\n\nDepending on implementation, a denial-of-service or privilege
  escalation vulnerability may occur in software that uses the `github.com/ecnepsnai/web`
  package with Web Sockets that have an AuthenticateMethod.\n\nThe `AuthenticateMethod`
  is not called, and `UserData` will be nil in request methods. Attempts to read the
  `UserData` may result in a panic.\n\nThis issue only affects web sockets where an
  `AuthenticateMethod` is supplied to the handle options. Users who do not use web
  sockets, or users who do not require authentication are not at risk.\n\n#### Example\n\nIn
  the example below, one would expect that the `AuthenticateMethod` function would
  be called for each request to `/example`\n\n```go\nhandleOptions := web.HandleOptions{\n\tAuthenticateMethod:
  func(request *http.Request) interface{} {\n\t\t// Assume there is logic here to
  check for an active sessions, look at cookies or headers, etc...\n\t\tvar session
  Session{} // Example\n\n\t\treturn session\n\t},\n}\n\nserver.Socket(\"/example\",
  handle, handleOptions)\n```\n\nHowever, the method is not called, and therefor the
  `UserData` parameter of the request object in the handle will be nil, when it would
  have been expected to be the `session` object we returned.\n\n### Patches\n\nRelease
  v1.5.2 fixes this vulnerability. The authenticate method is now called for websocket
  requests.\n\nAll users of the web package should update to v1.5.2 or later.\n\n###
  Workarounds\n\nYou may work around this issue by making the authenticate method
  a named function, then calling that function at the start of the handle method for
  the websocket. Reject connections when the return value of the method is nil."
