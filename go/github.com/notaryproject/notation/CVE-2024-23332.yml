title: "Operation on a Resource after Expiration or Release"
description: "The Notary Project is a set of specifications and tools intended to
  provide a cross-industry standard for securing software supply chains by using authentic
  container images and other OCI artifacts. An external actor with control of a compromised
  container registry can provide outdated versions of OCI artifacts, such as Images.
  This could lead artifact consumers with relaxed trust policies (such as `permissive`
  instead of `strict`) to potentially use artifacts with signatures that are no longer
  valid, making them susceptible to any exploits those artifacts may contain. In Notary
  Project, an artifact publisher can control the validity period of artifact by specifying
  signature expiry during the signing process. Using shorter signature validity periods
  along with processes to periodically resign artifacts, allows artifact producers
  to ensure that their consumers will only receive up-to-date artifacts. Artifact
  consumers should correspondingly use a `strict` or equivalent trust policy that
  enforces signature expiry. Together these steps enable use of up-to-date artifacts
  and safeguard against rollback attack in the event of registry compromise. The Notary
  Project offers various signature validation options such as `permissive`, `audit`
  and `skip` to support various scenarios. These scenarios includes 1) situations
  demanding urgent workload deployment, necessitating the bypassing of expired or
  revoked signatures; 2) auditing of artifacts lacking signatures without interrupting
  workload; and 3) skipping of verification for specific images that might have undergone
  validation through alternative mechanisms. Additionally, the Notary Project supports
  revocation to ensure the signature freshness. Artifact publishers can sign with
  short-lived certificates and revoke older certificates when necessary. This revocation
  serves as a signal to inform artifact consumers that the corresponding unexpired
  artifact is no longer approved by the publisher. This enables the artifact publisher
  to control the validity of the signature independently of their ability to manage
  artifacts in a compromised registry."
