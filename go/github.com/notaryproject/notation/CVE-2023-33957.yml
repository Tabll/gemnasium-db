description: "notation is a CLI tool to sign and verify OCI artifacts and container
  images. An attacker who has compromised a registry and added a high number of signatures
  to an artifact can cause denial of service of services on the machine, if a user
  runs notation inspect command on the same machine. The problem has been fixed in
  the release v1.0.0-rc.6. Users should upgrade their notation packages to v1.0.0-rc.6
  or above. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may restrict container
  registries to a set of secure and trusted container registries."
