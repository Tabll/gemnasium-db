title: "notation-go has an OS error when setting CRL cache leads to denial of signature
  verification"
description: "The issue was identified during Quarkslab's security audit on the Certificate
  Revocation List (CRL) based revocation check feature.\nAfter retrieving the CRL,
  notation-go attempts to update the CRL cache using the os.Rename method. However,
  this operation may fail due to operating system-specific limitations, particularly
  when the source and destination paths are on different mount points. This failure
  could lead to an unexpected program termination."
