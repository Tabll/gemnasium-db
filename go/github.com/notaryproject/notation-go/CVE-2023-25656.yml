package_slug: "go/github.com/notaryproject/notation-go"
title: "notation-go has excessive memory allocation on verification"
description: "notation-go is a collection of libraries for supporting Notation sign,
  verify, push, and pull of oci artifacts. Prior to version 1.0.0-rc.3, notation-go
  users will find their application using excessive memory when verifying signatures.
  The application will be killed, and thus availability is impacted. The problem has
  been patched in the release v1.0.0-rc.3. Some workarounds are available. Users can
  review their own trust policy file and check if the identity string contains `=#`.
  Meanwhile, users should only put trusted certificates in their trust stores referenced
  by their own trust policy files, and make sure the `authenticity` validation is
  set to `enforce`."
