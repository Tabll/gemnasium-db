package_slug: "go/github.com/bep/imagemeta"
title: "bep/imagemeta allows a potentially large memory allocation in PNG and WebP
  parsing"
description: "The buffer created for parsing metadata for PNG and WebP images was
  only bounded by their input data type, which could lead to potentially large memory
  allocation, and unreasonably high for image metadata. Before `v0.11.0`, If you didn't
  trust the input images, this could be abused to construct denial-of-service attacks."
