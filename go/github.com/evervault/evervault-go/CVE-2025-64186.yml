title: "Evervault Go SDK: Incomplete PCR Validation in Enclave Attestation for non-Evervault
  hosted Enclaves"
description: "A vulnerability was identified in the `evervault-go` SDK’s attestation
  verification logic that may allow incomplete documents to pass validation. This
  may cause the client to trust an enclave operator that does not meet expected integrity
  guarantees.\n\nThe exploitability of this issue is limited in Evervault-hosted environments
  as an attacker would require the pre-requisite ability to serve requests from specific
  evervault domain names, following from our ACME challenge based TLS certificate
  acquisition pipeline.\n\nThe vulnerability primarily affects applications which
  only check PCR8. Though the efficacy is also reduced for applications that check
  all PCR values, the impact is largely remediated by checking PCR 0, 1 and 2."
