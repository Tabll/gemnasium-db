title: "flagd: Multiple Go Runtime CVEs Impact Security and Availability"
description: "In 2025, several vulnerabilities in the Go Standard Library were disclosed,
  impacting Go-based applications like flagd (the evaluation engine for OpenFeature).
  These CVEs primarily focus on Denial of Service (DoS) through resource exhaustion
  and Race Conditions in database handling.\n\n| CVE ID | Impacted Package | Severity
  | Description & Impact on flagd |\n| -- | -- | -- | -- |\n| CVE-2025-47907 | database/sql
  | 7.0 (High) | Race Condition:  Canceling a query during a Scan call can return
  data from the wrong query. Critical if flagd uses SQL-based sync providers (e.g.,
  Postgres), potentially leading to incorrect flag configurations. |\n| CVE-2025-61725
  | net/mail | 7.5 (High) | DoS: Inefficient complexity in ParseAddress.  Attackers
  can provide crafted email strings with large domain literals to exhaust CPU if flagd
  parses email-formatted metadata. |\n| CVE-2025-61723 | encoding/pem | 7.5 (High)
  | DoS: Quadratic complexity when parsing invalid PEM inputs. Relevant if flagd loads
  TLS certificates or keys via PEM files from untrusted sources. |\n| CVE-2025-61729
  | crypto/x509 | 7.5 (High) | Resource Exhaustion: HostnameError.Error() lacks string
  concatenation limits. A malicious TLS certificate with thousands of hostnames could
  crash flagd during connection handshakes. |\n| CVE-2025-58188 | net/http | Medium
  | Request Smuggling: Improper header handling in HTTP/1.1. Could allow attackers
  to bypass security filters positioned in front of flagd sync or evaluation APIs.
  |\n| CVE-2025-58187 | archive/zip | Medium | DoS:  Improper validation of malformed
  ZIP archives.  Impacts flagd if configured to fetch and unpack zipped configuration
  bundles from remote providers. |"
