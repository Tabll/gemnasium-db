title: "gnark's range checker gadget allows wider inputs up to word alignment"
description: "### Impact\n\ngnark provides a gadget in the standard library to allow
  optimized checking of the bitwidth of the inputs. The gadget works by constructing
  a fixed lookup table containing all valid entries, partitioning the input and checking
  that all parts are inside the lookup table. The range checker gadget does not take
  into account that the highest partition may be less than the width limit, allowing
  the inputs to be up to 16 bits wider than checked.\n\nRange checking gadget is extensively
  used in field emulation. Users using any dependant gadget (ECDSA verification, proof
  recursion etc.) is impacted.\n\nWe consider the impact of the vulnerability being
  low as the number of attacker-modifiable bits is significantly smaller compared
  to the bit-width of scalar field modulus and it won't be possible to construct inputs
  which would allow to overflow the scalar field.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue has
  been patched in the stable branch of gnark. \n\nDue to low severity of the issue
  no emergency release will be issued and we follow the existing release plan. Versions
  v0.9.2 and higher are patched.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nWe consider the issue very
  hard to exploit and do not recommend manual remediation. However, it is possible
  to perform manual bit decomposition using `std/math/bits` gadget.\n\n### References\n\nInitial
  issue https://github.com/Consensys/gnark/issues/897\n\n### Acknowledgement\n\nThe
  issue was reported by [@ultrainstinct30](https://github.com/ultrainstinct30)."
