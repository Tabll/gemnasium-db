title: "gnark affected by denial of service when computing scalar multiplication using
  fake-GLV algorithm"
description: "For optimizing the scalar multiplication algorithm in circuit for some
  curves, gnark uses fake-GLV algorithm in case the curve doesn't support true-GLV.
  For this to work, we need to compute the scalar decomposition using the Half GCD
  method in gnark-crypto. However, for some of the inputs the algorithm didn't converge
  quickly enough.\n\nIn case the prover accepts untrusted witness, it could lead to
  denial of service as the prover gets stuck in a very slowly converging loop.\n\nThanks
  to @feltroidprime for reporting the issue and proposing a fix."
