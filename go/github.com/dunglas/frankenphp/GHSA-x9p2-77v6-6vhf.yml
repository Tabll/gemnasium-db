title: "FrankenPHP has delayed propagation of security fixes in upstream base images"
description: "**Vulnerability in base Docker images (PHP, Go, and Alpine) not automatically
  propagating to FrankenPHP images.**\n\nFrankenPHP's container images were previously
  built only when specific version tags were updated or when manual triggers were
  initiated. This meant that if an upstream base image (such as Alpine Linux or official
  PHP/Go images) received a security patch under an existing tag, the FrankenPHP image
  would remain on the older, vulnerable version of those base layers."
