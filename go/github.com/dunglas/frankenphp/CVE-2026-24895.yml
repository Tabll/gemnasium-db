title: "FrankenPHP's unicode case-folding length expansion causes incorrect split_path
  index (SCRIPT_NAME/PATH_INFO confusion) in FrankenPHP"
description: "FrankenPHP’s CGI path splitting logic improperly handles Unicode characters
  during case conversion. The logic computes the split index (for finding `.php`)
  on a lowercased copy of the request path but applies that byte index to the original
  path.\n\nBecause `strings.ToLower()` in Go can increase the byte length of certain
  UTF-8 characters (e.g., `Ⱥ` expands when lowercased), the computed index may not
  align with the correct position in the original string. This results in an incorrect
  `SCRIPT_NAME` and `SCRIPT_FILENAME`, potentially causing FrankenPHP to execute a
  file other than the one intended by the URI."
