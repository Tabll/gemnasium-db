title: "Kargo has an Authorization Bypass Vulnerability in Batch Resource Creation
  API Endpoints"
description: "The batch resource creation endpoints of both Kargo's legacy gRPC API
  and newer REST API accept multi-document YAML payloads. When either endpoint creates
  a `Project` resource, creation of subsequent resources from that same payload belonging
  in that Project's underlying Kubernetes namespace, by design, proceeds using the
  API server's own permissions. The creator of a new Project automatically becomes
  its administrator, but those permissions are granted asynchronously by the management
  controller. The design choice to create the affected resources using the API server's
  own permissions averts a race and is contextually appropriate.\n\nSpecially crafted
  payloads can manifest a bug present in the logic of both endpoints to inject arbitrary
  resources (of specific types only) into the underlying namespace of an _existing_
  Project using the API server's own permissions when that behavior was _not_ intended.
  Critically, an attacker may exploit this as a vector for elevating their own permissions,
  which can then be leveraged to achieve remote code execution or secret exfiltration.
  Exfiltrated artifact repository credentials can be leveraged, in turn, to execute
  further attacks.\n\nIn some configurations of the Kargo control plane's underlying
  Kubernetes cluster, elevated permissions may additionally be leveraged to achieve
  remote code execution or secret exfiltration using `kubectl`. This can reduce the
  complexity of the attack, however, worst case scenarios remain entirely achievable
  even without this."
