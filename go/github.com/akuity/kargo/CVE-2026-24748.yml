title: "Kargo's `GetConfig()` and `RefreshResource()` API endpoints allow unauthenticated
  access"
description: "A bug was found with authentication checks on the `GetConfig()` API
  endpoint. This allowed unauthenticated users to access this endpoint by specifying
  an `Authorization` header with any non-empty `Bearer` token value, regardless of
  validity.  This vulnerability did allow for exfiltration of configuration data such
  as endpoints for connected Argo CD clusters. This data could allow an attacker to
  enumerate cluster URLs and namespaces for use in subsequent attacks.\n\nAdditionally,
  the same bug affected the `RefreshResource` endpoint. This endpoint does not lead
  to any information disclosure, but could be used by an unauthenticated attacker
  to perform a denial-of-service style attack against the Kargo API. `RefreshResource`
  sets an annotation on specific Kubernetes resources to trigger reconciliations.
  If run on a constant loop, this could also slow down legitimate requests to the
  Kubernetes API server.\n\nThis vulnerability was identified by security researchers,
  and there are no known reports of exploitation in the wild."
