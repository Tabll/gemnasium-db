title: "Kargo has Missing Authorization Vulnerabilities in Approval & Promotion REST
  API Endpoints"
description: "Kargo's authorization model includes a `promote` verb -- a non-standard
  Kubernetes [\"dolphin verb\"](https://www.aquasec.com/blog/kubernetes-verbs/) --
  that gates the ability to advance `Freight` through a promotion pipeline. This verb
  exists to separate the ability to _manage_ promotion-related resources from the
  ability to _trigger_ promotions, enabling fine-grained access control over what
  is often a sensitive operation.\n\nThe `promote` verb is correctly enforced in Kargo's
  legacy gRPC API. However, three endpoints in the newer REST API omit this check,
  relying only on standard Kubernetes RBAC for the underlying resource operations
  (`patch` on `freights/status` or `create` on `promotions`). This permits users who
  hold those standard permissions -- but who were deliberately _not_ granted `promote`
  -- to bypass the intended authorization boundary.\n\nThe affected endpoints are:\n\n1.
  `POST /v1beta1/projects/{project}/freight/{freight}/approve`\n\nApproves `Freight`
  for promotion to a specific `Stage`.\n\nThe endpoint is intended to require both
  `patch` permission on `Freight` status and `promote` permission on the target `Stage`,
  but asserts only the former.\n\n2. `POST /v1beta1/projects/{project}/stages/{stage}/promotions`\n\nPromotes
  `Freight` to a specific `Stage`.\n\nThe endpoint is intended to require both `create`
  permission on `Promotion` resources and `promote` permission on the target `Stage`,
  but asserts only the former.\n\n3. `POST /v1beta1/projects/{project}/stages/{stage}/promotions/downstream`\n\nPromotes
  `Freight` to all `Stage`s immediately downstream of a given `Stage`.\n\nThe endpoint
  is intended to require both `create` permission on `Promotion` resources and `promote`
  permission on each downstream `Stage`, but asserts only the former."
