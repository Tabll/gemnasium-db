package_slug: "go/github.com/ElrondNetwork/elrond-go"
title: "Improper Initialization"
description: "Elrond go is the go implementation for the Elrond Network protocol.
  In versions prior to 1.3.35, read only calls between contracts can generate smart
  contracts results. For example, if contract A calls in read only mode contract B
  and the called function will make changes upon the contract's B state, the state
  will be altered for contract B as if the call was not made in the read-only mode.
  This can lead to some effects not designed by the original smart contracts programmers.
  This issue was patched in version 1.3.35. There are no known workarounds."
