title: "Incorrect Resource Transfer Between Spheres"
description: "Elrond-GO is a go implementation for the Elrond Network protocol. Versions
  prior to 1.3.50 are subject to a processing issue where nodes are affected when
  trying to process a cross-shard relayed transaction with a smart contract deploy
  transaction data. The problem was a bad correlation between the transaction caches
  and the processing component. If the above-mentioned transaction was sent with more
  gas than required, the smart contract result (SCR transaction) that should have
  returned the leftover gas, would have been wrongly added to a cache that the processing
  unit does not consider. The node stopped notarizing metachain blocks. The fix was
  actually to extend the SCR transaction search in all other caches if it wasn't found
  in the correct (expected) sharded-cache. There are no known workarounds at this
  time. This issue has been patched in version 1.3.50."
