title: "User with ci:ReadAction permissions and write permissions to one path in a
  repository may copy objects from any path in the repository"
description: "### Impact\n\nA bug in permissions validation allows a user with the
  `ci:ReadAction` permission to skip read checks when copying an object. If they additionally
  have read and write permission to path in the repository, they can copy an otherwise
  unreadable object and read it.\n\nIn order to be affected and exploitable, the following
  conditions must ALL occur on the same user:\n1. `ci:ReadAction` enabled for the
  repository. Predefined policies RepoManagementRead and RepoManagementFullAccess
  allow this action.\n2. `fs:ReadObject` and `fs:WriteObject` enabled for some path.\n3.
  `fs:ReadObject` _not_ available for some path\n\nSuch a user can use (1) to copy
  the unreadable object (3) to a path that they can read and write (2). At that point
  they can read the object copy.\n\n### Patches\n\nReleases >= 1.12.1 fix this issue
  in lakeFS.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAs a workaround, use RBAC to deny `ci:*` permissions
  to all users, or to all users who have limited read access.\n\nMany installations
  are unaffected:\n\n* **Installations using ACLs are _not_ affected.** This includes
  all OSS installations that have not implemented an external authorization server.
  We do not know of any OSS installations that have implemented such a server. ACLs
  that allow ci:ReadAction also allow reading repositories, so no capabilities are
  granted.\n* **Installations using RBAC that use only predefined policies with \"all\"
  ARNs (\"*\") are _not_ affected.** This includes **all installations that have not
  defined any new groups in RBAC.**\n\nIn order to be affected, **installations using
  RBAC** must define users and simultaneous allow `ci:ReadAction` and disallow `fs:ReadObject`
  for some path. `ci:ReadAction` is available in policies RepoManagementReadAll and
  RepoManagementFullAccess. By default these actions are configured for groups Developers
  and above, for all repositories and paths.\n\n\n### References\n\n* [lakeFS RBAC](https://docs.lakefs.io/reference/security/rbac.html)\n\n"
