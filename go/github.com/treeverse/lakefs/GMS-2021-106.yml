  of a repository may use the S3 gateway to copy any object in the repository if they
  know its name.\n1. [medium] A user with permission to write any one of tags, branches,
  or commits on a repository may write all of them.\n1. [low] A user with permission

  may retrieve graveler information about the location on underlying storage of all
  objects stored in any commit that they can view.  If the user additionally has the
  capability to read underlying storage, they will be able to retrieve metadata associated
  with all objects in that commit.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any
