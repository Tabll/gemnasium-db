title: "RandomAlphaNumeric and CryptoRandomAlphaNumeric are not as random as they
  should be"
description: "A security-sensitive bug was discovered by Open Source Developer *Erik
  Sundell of Sundell Open Source Consulting AB*.\n\nThe functions `RandomAlphaNumeric(int)`
  and `CryptoRandomAlphaNumeric(int)` are not as random as they should be. Small values
  of `int` in the functions above will return a smaller subset of results than they
  should. For example, `RandomAlphaNumeric(1)` will always return a digit in the 0-9
  range, while `RandomAlphaNumeric(4)` will return around ~7 million of the ~13M possible
  permutations.\n\nThis is considered a security release because programs that rely
  upon random generators for passwords are at an increased risk of brute force-style
  password guessing. There is also a higher probability of collision.\n\nThe problem
  was the result of a mistaken regular expression that only accepted random strings
  if they contained a digit from `[0-9]`. That restriction has been removed."
