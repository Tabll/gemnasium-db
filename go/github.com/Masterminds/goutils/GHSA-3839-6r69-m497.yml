title: "Duplicate Advisory: GoUtils's randomly-generated alphanumeric strings contain
  significantly less entropy than expected"
description: "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-xg2h-wx96-xgxr. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n## Original Description\nRandomly-generated alphanumeric strings
  contain significantly less entropy than expected. The `RandomAlphaNumeric` and `CryptoRandomAlphaNumeric`
  functions always return strings containing at least one digit from 0 to 9. This
  significantly reduces the amount of entropy in short strings generated by these
  functions."
