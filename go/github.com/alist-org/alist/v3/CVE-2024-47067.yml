title: "Alist reflected Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability"
description: "AList is a file list program that supports multiple storages. AList
  contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in helper.go. The endpoint
  /i/:link_name takes in a user-provided value and reflects it back in the response.
  The endpoint returns an application/xml response, opening it up to HTML tags via
  XHTML and thus leading to a XSS vulnerability. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.29.0."
