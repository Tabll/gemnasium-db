title: "mholt/archiver Vulnerable to Path Traversal via Crafted ZIP File"
description: "A Path Traversal \"Zip Slip\" vulnerability has been identified in mholt/archiver
  in Go. This vulnerability allows using a crafted ZIP file containing path traversal
  symlinks to create or overwrite files with the user's privileges or application
  utilizing the library.\n\nWhen using the archiver.Unarchive functionality with ZIP
  files, like this: archiver.Unarchive(zipFile, outputDir),Â  A crafted ZIP file can
  be extracted in such a way that it writes files to the affected system with the
  same privileges as the application executing this vulnerable functionality. Consequently,
  sensitive files may be overwritten, potentially leading to privilege escalation,
  code execution, and other severe outcomes in some cases.\n\nIt's worth noting that
  a similar vulnerability was found in TAR files (CVE-2024-0406). Although a fix was
  implemented, it hasn't been officially released, and the affected project has since
  been deprecated. The successor to mholt/archiver is a new project called mholt/archives,
  and its initial release (v0.1.0) removes the Unarchive() functionality."
