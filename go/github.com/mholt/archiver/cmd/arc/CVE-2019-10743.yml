package_slug: "go/github.com/mholt/archiver/cmd/arc"
title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "All versions of archiver allow attacker to perform a Zip Slip attack
  via the \"unarchive\" functions. It is exploited using a specially crafted zip archive,
  that holds path traversal filenames. When exploited, a filename in a malicious archive
  is concatenated to the target extraction directory, which results in the final path
  ending up outside of the target folder. For instance, a zip may hold a file with
  a \"../../file.exe\" location and thus break out of the target folder. If an executable
  or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the
  problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily."
