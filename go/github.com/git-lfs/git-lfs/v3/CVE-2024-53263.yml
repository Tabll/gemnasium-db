package_slug: "go/github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/v3"
title: "Git LFS permits exfiltration of credentials via crafted HTTP URLs"
description: "When Git LFS requests credentials from Git for a remote host, it passes
  portions of the host's URL to the `git-credential(1)` command without checking for
  embedded line-ending control characters, and then sends any credentials it receives
  back from the Git credential helper to the remote host.  By inserting URL-encoded
  control characters such as line feed (LF) or carriage return (CR) characters into
  the URL, an attacker may be able to retrieve a user's Git credentials."
