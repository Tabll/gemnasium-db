package_slug: "go/github.com/authelia/authelia/v4"
title: "Authelia applies regulation separately to Username-based logins to Email-based
  logins"
description: "If users are allowed to sign in via both username and email the regulation
  system treats these as separate login events. This leads to the regulation limitations
  being effectively doubled assuming an attacker using brute-force to find a user
  password. It's important to note that due to the effective operation of regulation
  where no user-facing sign of their regulation ban being visible either via timing
  or via API responses, it's effectively impossible to determine if a failure occurs
  due to a bad username password combination, or a effective ban blocking the attempt
  which heavily mitigates any form of brute-force."
