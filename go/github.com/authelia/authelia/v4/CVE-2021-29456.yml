title: "URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')"
description: "Utilizing a HTTP query parameter an attacker is able to redirect users 
  from the web application to any domain. The URL of the intended redirect should always 
  be checked for safety prior to forwarding the user. Other endpoints of the web application
  already do this, they check both that the domain is using the HTTPS protocol and that 
  it exists on a domain associated with the application. An attacker is able to use this 
  unintended functionality to redirect users to malicious sites. This particular security 
  issue allows the attacker to make a phishing attempt seem much more trustworthy to a
  user of the web application as the initial site before redirection is familiar to 
  them, as well as the actual URL which they have theoretically visited frequently."
