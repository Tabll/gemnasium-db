title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "Authelia is a a single sign-on multi-factor portal for web apps. This
  affects uses who are using nginx ngx_http_auth_request_module with Authelia, it
  allows a malicious individual who crafts a malformed HTTP request to bypass the
  authentication mechanism. It additionally could theoretically affect other proxy
  servers, but all of the ones we officially support except nginx do not allow malformed
  URI paths. The problem is rectified entirely in v4.29.3. As this patch is relatively
  straightforward we can back port this to any version upon request. Alternatively
  we are supplying a git patch to 4.25.1 which should be relatively straightforward
  to apply to any version, the git patches for specific versions can be found in the
  references. The most relevant workaround is upgrading. You can also add a block
  which fails requests that contains a malformed URI in the internal location block."
