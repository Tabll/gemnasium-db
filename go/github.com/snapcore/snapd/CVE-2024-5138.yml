title: "CVE-2024-5138: snapd snapctl auth bypass"
description: "A snap with prior permissions to create a mount entry on the host, such
  as firefox, normally uses the permission from one of the per-snap hook programs.
  A unprivileged users cannot normally trigger that behaviour by using `snap run --shell
  firefox` followed by `snapctl mount`, since snapd validates the requesting user
  identity (root or non-root). The issue allows unprivileged users to bypass that
  check by crafting a malicious command line vector which confuses snapd into thinking
  the help message is requested.\n\nUnprivileged user on a default installation of
  Ubuntu, where firefox is as provided as a snap, may cause a denial-of-service attack
  by repeatedly mounting hunspell database over and over and eventually exhausting
  system memory.\n\nOther attacks, reliant on the same underying mechanism (mount),
  are possible. In all cases the snap must be installed and grated permission to perform
  this action (by connecting an appropriate snap interface), which requires administrative
  privileges. As such we are focusing on the case of default installation where an
  unprivileged user may exploit this behavior."
