package_slug: "go/github.com/snapcore/snapd"
title: "snapd failed to restrict writes to the $HOME/bin path"
description: "In snapd versions prior to 2.62, when using AppArmor for enforcement
  of sandbox permissions, snapd failed to restrict writes to the $HOME/bin path. In
  Ubuntu, when this path exists, it is automatically added to the users PATH. An attacker
  who could convince a user to install a malicious snap which used the 'home' plug
  could use this vulnerability to install arbitrary scripts into the users PATH which
  may then be run by the user outside of the expected snap sandbox and hence allow
  them to escape confinement."
