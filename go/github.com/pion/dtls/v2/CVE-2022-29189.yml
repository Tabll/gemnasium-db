title: "Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')"
description: "Pion DTLS is a Go implementation of Datagram Transport Layer Security.
  Prior to version 2.1.4, a buffer that was used for inbound network traffic had no
  upper limit. Pion DTLS would buffer all network traffic from the remote user until
  the handshake completes or timed out. An attacker could exploit this to cause excessive
  memory usage. Version 2.1.4 contains a patch for this issue. There are currently
  no known workarounds available."
