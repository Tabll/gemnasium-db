package_slug: "go/github.com/pion/dtls/v2"
title: "Improper Certificate Validation"
description: "Pion DTLS is a Go implementation of Datagram Transport Layer Security.
  Prior to version 2.1.5, a DTLS Client could provide a Certificate that it does not
  posses the private key for and Pion DTLS wouldn't reject it. This issue affects
  users that are using Client certificates only. The connection itself is still secure.
  The Certificate provided by clients can't be trusted when using a Pion DTLS server
  prior to version 2.1.5. Users should upgrade to version 2.1.5 to receive a patch.
  There are currently no known workarounds."
