title: "Pion DTLS's usage of random nonce generation with AES GCM ciphers risks leaking
  the authentication key"
description: "Pion DTLS versions v1.0.0 through v3.1.0 use random nonce generation
  with AES GCM ciphers, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain the authentication
  key and spoof data by leveraging the reuse of a nonce in a session and a \"forbidden
  attack\"."
