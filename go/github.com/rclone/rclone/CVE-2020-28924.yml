package_slug: "go/github.com/rclone/rclone"
title: "Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)"
description: "An issue was discovered in Rclone before 1.53.3. Due to the use of a
  weak random number generator, the password generator has been producing weak passwords
  with much less entropy than advertised. The suggested passwords depend deterministically
  on the time the second rclone was started. This limits the entropy of the passwords
  enormously. These passwords are often used in the crypt backend for encryption of
  data. It would be possible to make a dictionary of all possible passwords with about
  38 million entries per password length. This would make decryption of secret material
  possible with a plausible amount of effort. NOTE: all passwords generated by affected
  versions should be changed."
