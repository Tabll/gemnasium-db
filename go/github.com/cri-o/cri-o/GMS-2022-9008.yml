package_slug: "go/github.com/cri-o/cri-o"
title: "CRI-O vulnerable to /etc/passwd tampering resulting in Privilege Escalation"
description: "### Impact\nIt is possible to craft an environment variable with newlines
  to add entries to a container's /etc/passwd. It is possible to circumvent admission
  validation of username/UID by adding such an entry.\n\nNote: because the pod author
  is in control of the container's /etc/passwd, this is not considered a new risk
  factor. However, this advisory is being opened for transparency and as a way of
  tracking fixes.\n\n### Patches\n1.26.0 will have the fix. More patches will be posted
  as they're available.\n\n### Workarounds\nAdditional security controls like SELinux
  should prevent any damage a container is able to do with root on the host. Using
  SELinux is recommended because this class of attack is already possible by manually
  editing the container's /etc/passwd \n\n### References\n"
