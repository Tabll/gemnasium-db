title: "CRI-O has Potential High Memory Consumption from File Read"
description: "There's a vulnerability in the CRI-O application where when container
  is launched with securityContext.runAsUser specifying a non-existent user, CRI-O
  attempts to create the user, reading the container's entire /etc/passwd file into
  memory. If this file is excessively large, it can cause the a high memory consumption
  leading applications to be killed due to out-of-memory. As a result a denial-of-service
  can be achieved, possibly disrupting other pods and services running in the same
  host."
