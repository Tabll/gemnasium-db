title: "CRI-O: Maliciously structured checkpoint file can gain arbitrary node access"
description: "A vulnerability was found in CRI-O, where it can be requested to take a 
  checkpoint archive of a container and later be asked to restore it. When it does that 
  restoration, it attempts to restore the mounts from the restore archive instead of the 
  pod request. As a result, the validations run on the pod spec, verifying that the pod 
  has access to the mounts it specifies are not applicable to a restored container. This 
  flaw allows a malicious user to trick CRI-O into restoring a pod that doesn't have 
  access to host mounts. The user needs access to the kubelet or cri-o socket to call the 
  restore endpoint and trigger the restore."
