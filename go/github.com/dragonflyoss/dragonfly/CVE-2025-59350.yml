title: "Dragonfly vulnerable to timing attacks against Proxy’s basic authentication"
description: "The access control mechanism for the Proxy feature uses simple string
  comparisons and is therefore vulnerable to timing attacks. An attacker may try to
  guess the password one character at a time by sending all possible characters to
  a vulnerable mechanism and measuring the comparison instruction’s execution times.\nThe
  vulnerability is shown in figure 8.1, where both the username and password are compared
  with a short-circuiting equality operation.\n\n```golang\nif user != proxy.basicAuth.Username
  || pass != proxy.basicAuth.Password {\n```\n\nIt is currently undetermined what
  an attacker may be able to do with access to the proxy password."
