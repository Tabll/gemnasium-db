title: "Dragonfly incorrectly handles a task structure’s usedTrac field"
description: "The processPieceFromSource method (figure 4.1) is part of a task processing
  mechanism. The method writes pieces of data to storage, updating a Task structure
  along the way. The method does not update the structure’s usedTraffic field, because
  an uninitialized variable n is used as a guard to the AddTraffic method call, instead
  of the result.Size variable.\n\n```golang\nvar n int64\nresult.Size, err = pt.GetStorage().WritePiece([skipped])\nresult.FinishTime
  = time.Now().UnixNano()\nif n > 0 {\npt.AddTraffic(uint64(n))\n}\n```\n\nA task
  is processed by a peer. The usedTraffic metadata is not updated during the processing.
  Rate limiting is incorrectly applied, leading to a denial-of-service condition for
  the peer."
