package_slug: "go/github.com/ctfer-io/chall-manager"
title: "Chall-Manager is vulnerable to Path Traversal when extracting/decoding a zip
  archive"
description: "When decoding a scenario (i.e. a zip archive), the path of the file
  to write is not checked, potentially leading to zip slips.\nExploitation does not
  require authentication nor authorization, so anyone can exploit it. It should nonetheless
  not be exploitable as it is **highly** recommended to bury Chall-Manager deep within
  the infrastructure due to its large capabilities, so no users could reach the system."
