package_slug: "go/github.com/ctfer-io/chall-manager"
title: "Chall-Manager's HTTP Gateway is vulnerable to DoS due to missing header timeout"
description: "The HTTP Gateway processes headers, but with no timeout set. With a
  Slowloris attack, an attacker could cause Denial of Service (DoS).\nExploitation
  does not require authentication nor authorization, so anyone can exploit it. It
  should nonetheless not be exploitable as it is highly recommended to bury Chall-Manager
  deep within the infrastructure due to its large capabilities, so no users could
  reach the system."
