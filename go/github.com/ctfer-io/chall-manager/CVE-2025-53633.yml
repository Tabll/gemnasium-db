package_slug: "go/github.com/ctfer-io/chall-manager"
title: "Chall-Manager's scenario decoding process does not check for zip bombs"
description: "When decoding a scenario (i.e. a zip archive), the size of the decoded
  content is not checked, potentially leading to zip bombs decompression.\nExploitation
  does not require authentication nor authorization, so anyone can exploit it. It
  should nonetheless not be exploitable as it is highly recommended to bury Chall-Manager
  deep within the infrastructure due to its large capabilities, so no users could
  reach the system."
