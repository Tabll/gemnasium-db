title: "Gokapi vulnerable to stored XSS via uploading file with malicious file name"
description: "When using end-to-end encryption, a stored XSS vulnerability can be
  exploited by uploading a file with JavaScript code embedded in the filename. After
  upload and every time someone opens the upload list, the script is then parsed.\n\nWith
  the affected versions <v2.0, there was no user permission system implemented, therefore
  all authenticated users were already able to see and modify all resources, even
  if end-to-end encrypted, as the encryption key had to be the same for all users
  with <v2.0. Nethertheless with XSS, other attack vectors like redirection or crypto
  mining would be possble."
