title: "Anubis vulnerable to possible XSS via redir parameter when using subrequest
  auth mode"
description: "When using subrequest authentication, Anubis did not perform validation
  of the redirect URL and redirects user to any URL scheme. While most modern browsers
  do not allow a redirect to `javascript:` URLs, it could still trigger dangerous
  behavior in some cases.\n\n`GET https://example.com/.within.website/?redir=javascript:alert()`
  responds with `Location: javascript:alert()`."
