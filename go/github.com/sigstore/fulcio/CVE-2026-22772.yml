package_slug: "go/github.com/sigstore/fulcio"
title: "Fulcio is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via MetaIssuer
  Regex Bypass"
description: "Fulcio's `metaRegex()` function uses unanchored regex, allowing attackers
  to bypass MetaIssuer URL validation and trigger SSRF to arbitrary internal services.\n\nSince
  the SSRF only can trigger GET requests, the request cannot mutate state. The response
  from the GET request is not returned to the caller so data exfiltration is not possible.
  A malicious actor could attempt to probe an internal network through [Blind SSRF](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/blind)."
