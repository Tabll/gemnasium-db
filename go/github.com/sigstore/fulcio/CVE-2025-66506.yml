package_slug: "go/github.com/sigstore/fulcio"
title: "Fulcio allocates excessive memory during token parsing"
description: "Function [identity.extractIssuerURL](https://github.com/sigstore/fulcio/blob/main/pkg/identity/issuerpool.go#L44-L45)
  currently splits (via a call to [strings.Split](https://pkg.go.dev/strings#Split))
  its argument (which is untrusted data) on periods.\n\nAs a result, in the face of
  a malicious request with an (invalid) OIDC identity token in the payload containing
  many period characters, a call to `extractIssuerURL` incurs allocations to the tune
  of O(n) bytes (where n stands for the length of the function's argument), with a
  constant factor of about 16. Relevant weakness: [CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption
  (Amplification)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/405.html)\n\nDetails\nSee
  [identity.extractIssuerURL](https://github.com/sigstore/fulcio/blob/main/pkg/identity/issuerpool.go#L44-L45)\n\nImpact\nExcessive
  memory allocation"
