package_slug: "go/github.com/sigstore/policy-controller"
title: "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature"
description: "PolicyController is a utility used to enforce supply chain policy in
  Kubernetes clusters. In versions prior to 0.2.1 PolicyController will report a false
  positive, resulting in an admission when it should not be admitted when there is
  at least one attestation with a valid signature and there are NO attestations of
  the type being verified (--type defaults to \"custom\"). An example image that can
  be used to test this is `ghcr.io/distroless/static@sha256:dd7614b5a12bc4d617b223c588b4e0c833402b8f4991fb5702ea83afad1986e2`.
  Users should upgrade to version 0.2.1 to resolve this issue. There are no workarounds
  for users unable to upgrade."
