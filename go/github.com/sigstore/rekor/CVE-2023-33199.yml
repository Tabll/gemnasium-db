package_slug: "go/github.com/sigstore/rekor"
title: "malformed proposed intoto entries can cause a panic"
description: "Rekor's goals are to provide an immutable tamper resistant ledger of
  metadata generated within a software projects supply chain. A malformed proposed
  entry of the `intoto/v0.0.2` type can cause a panic on a thread within the Rekor
  process. The thread is recovered so the client receives a 500 error message and
  service still continues, so the availability impact of this is minimal. This has
  been fixed in v1.2.0 of Rekor. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
  workarounds for this vulnerability."
