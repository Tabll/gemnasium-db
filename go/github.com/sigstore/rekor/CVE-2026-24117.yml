title: "Rekor affected by Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via provided public key
  URL"
description: "`/api/v1/index/retrieve` supports retrieving a public key via a user-provided
  URL, allowing attackers to trigger SSRF to arbitrary internal services.\n\nSince
  the SSRF only can trigger GET requests, the request cannot mutate state. The response
  from the GET request is not returned to the caller so data exfiltration is not possible.
  A malicious actor could attempt to probe an internal network through [Blind SSRF](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/blind)."
