title: "sigstore-go has an unbounded loop over untrusted input can lead to endless
  data attack"
description: "sigstore-go is susceptible to a denial of service attack when a verifier
  is provided a maliciously crafted Sigstore Bundle containing large amounts of verifiable
  data, in the form of signed transparency log entries, RFC 3161 timestamps, and attestation
  subjects. The verification of these data structures is computationally expensive.
  This can be used to consume excessive CPU resources, leading to a denial of service
  attack. TUF's security model labels this type of vulnerability an \"Endless data
  attack,\" and can lead to verification failing to complete and disrupting services
  that rely on sigstore-go for verification.\n\nThe vulnerable loops are in the verification
  functions in the package `github.com/sigstore/sigstore-go/pkg/verify`. The first
  is the DSSE envelope verification loop in `verifyEnvelopeWithArtifact`, which decodes
  all the digests in an attestation can be found here:\n\nhttps://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-go/blob/725e508ed4933e6f5b5206e32af4bbe76f587b54/pkg/verify/signature.go#L183-L193\n\nThe
  next loop is in the `VerifyArtifactTransparencyLog` function, which verifies all
  the signed entries in a bundle:\n\nhttps://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-go/blob/725e508ed4933e6f5b5206e32af4bbe76f587b54/pkg/verify/tlog.go#L74-L178\n\nThe
  next loop is the `VerifyTimestampAuthority` function, which verifies all the RFC
  3161 timestamps in a bundle:\n\nhttps://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-go/blob/725e508ed4933e6f5b5206e32af4bbe76f587b54/pkg/verify/tsa.go#L59-L68"
