title: "Gitsign's Rekor public keys fetched from upstream API instead of local TUF
  client."
description: "Gitsign is software for keyless Git signing using Sigstore. In versions
  of gitsign starting with 0.6.0 and prior to 0.8.0, Rekor public keys were fetched
  via the Rekor API, instead of through the local TUF client. If the upstream Rekor
  server happened to be compromised, gitsign clients could potentially be tricked
  into trusting incorrect signatures. There is no known compromise the default public
  good instance (`rekor.sigstore.dev`) - anyone using this instance is unaffected.
  This issue was fixed in v0.8.0. No known workarounds are available."
