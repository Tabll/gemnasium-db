package_slug: "go/github.com/sigstore/cosign"
title: "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature"
description: "Cosign is a project under the sigstore organization which aims to make
  signatures invisible infrastructure. In versions prior to 1.12.0 a number of vulnerabilities
  have been found in cosign verify-blob, where Cosign would successfully verify an
  artifact when verification should have failed. First a cosign bundle can be crafted
  to successfully verify a blob even if the embedded rekorBundle does not reference
  the given signature. Second, when providing identity flags, the email and issuer
  of a certificate is not checked when verifying a Rekor bundle, and the GitHub Actions
  identity is never checked. Third, providing an invalid Rekor bundle without the
  experimental flag results in a successful verification. And fourth an invalid transparency
  log entry will result in immediate success for verification. Details and examples
  of these issues can be seen in the GHSA-8gw7-4j42-w388 advisory linked. Users are
  advised to upgrade to 1.12.0. There are no known workarounds for these issues."
