package_slug: "go/github.com/sigstore/cosign"
title: "Improper Certificate Validation"
description: "Cosign provides container signing, verification, and storage in an OCI
  registry for the sigstore project. Prior to version 1.5.2, Cosign can be manipulated
  to claim that an entry for a signature exists in the Rekor transparency log even
  if it does not. This requires the attacker to have pull and push permissions for
  the signature in OCI. This can happen with both standard signing with a keypair
  and \"keyless signing\" with Fulcio. If an attacker has access to the signature
  in OCI, they can manipulate cosign into believing the entry was stored in Rekor
  even though it wasn't. The vulnerability has been patched in v1.5.2 of Cosign. The
  `signature` in the `signedEntryTimestamp` provided by Rekor is now compared to the
  `signature` that is being verified. If these don't match, then an error is returned.
  If a valid bundle is copied to a different signature, verification should fail.
  Cosign output now only informs the user that certificates were verified if a certificate
  was in fact verified. There is currently no known workaround."
