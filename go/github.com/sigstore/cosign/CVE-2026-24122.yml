package_slug: "go/github.com/sigstore/cosign"
title: "Cosign considered signatures valid with expired intermediate certificates
  when transparency log verification is skipped"
description: "When verifying artifact signatures using a certificate, Cosign first
  verifies the certificate chain using the leaf certificate's \"not before\" timestamp
  and later checks expiry of the leaf certificate using either a signed timestamp
  provided by the Rekor transparency log or from a timestamp authority, or using the
  current time. The root and all issuing certificates are assumed to be valid during
  the leaf certificate's validity. An issuing certificate with a validity that expires
  before the leaf certificate will be considered valid during verification even if
  the provided timestamp would mean the issuing certificate should be considered expired."
