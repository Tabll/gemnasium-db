title: "Cosign vulnerable to possible endless data attack from attacker-controlled
  registry"
description: "Cosign is a sigstore signing tool for OCI containers. Cosign is susceptible
  to a denial of service by an attacker controlled registry. An attacker who controls
  a remote registry can return a high number of attestations and/or signatures to
  Cosign and cause Cosign to enter a long loop resulting in an endless data attack.
  The root cause is that Cosign loops through all attestations fetched from the remote
  registry in pkg/cosign.FetchAttestations. The attacker needs to compromise the registry
  or make a request to a registry they control. When doing so, the attacker must return
  a high number of attestations in the response to Cosign. The result will be that
  the attacker can cause Cosign to go into a long or infinite loop that will prevent
  other users from verifying their data. In Kyvernos case, an attacker whose privileges
  are limited to making requests to the cluster can make a request with an image reference
  to their own registry, trigger the infinite loop and deny other users from completing
  their admission requests. Alternatively, the attacker can obtain control of the
  registry used by an organization and return a high number of attestations instead
  the expected number of attestations. The issue can be mitigated rather simply by
  setting a limit to the limit of attestations that Cosign will loop through. The
  limit does not need to be high to be within the vast majority of use cases and still
  prevent the endless data attack. This issue has been patched in version 2.2.1 and
  users are advised to upgrade."
