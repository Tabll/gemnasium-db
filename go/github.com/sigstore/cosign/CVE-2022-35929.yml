package_slug: "go/github.com/sigstore/cosign"
title: "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature"
description: "cosign is a container signing and verification utility. In versions
  prior to 1.10.1 cosign can report a false positive if any attestation exists. `cosign
  verify-attestation` used with the `--type` flag will report a false positive verification
  when there is at least one attestation with a valid signature and there are NO attestations
  of the type being verified (--type defaults to \"custom\"). This can happen when
  signing with a standard keypair and with \"keyless\" signing with Fulcio. This vulnerability
  can be reproduced with the `distroless.dev/static@sha256:dd7614b5a12bc4d617b223c588b4e0c833402b8f4991fb5702ea83afad1986e2`
  image. This image has a `vuln` attestation but not an `spdx` attestation. However,
  if you run `cosign verify-attestation --type=spdx` on this image, it incorrectly
  succeeds. This issue has been addressed in version 1.10.1 of cosign. Users are advised
  to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue."
