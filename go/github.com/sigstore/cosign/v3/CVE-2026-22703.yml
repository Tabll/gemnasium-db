title: "Cosign verification accepts any valid Rekor entry under certain conditions"
description: "A Cosign bundle can be crafted to successfully verify an artifact even
  if the embedded Rekor entry does not reference the artifact's digest, signature
  or public key. When verifying a Rekor entry, Cosign verifies the Rekor entry signature,
  and also compares the artifact's digest, the user's public key from either a Fulcio
  certificate or provided by the user, and the artifact signature to the Rekor entry
  contents. Without these comparisons, Cosign would accept any response from Rekor
  as valid. A malicious actor that has compromised a user's identity or signing key
  could construct a valid Cosign bundle by including any arbitrary Rekor entry, thus
  preventing the user from being able to audit the signing event.\n\nThis vulnerability
  only affects users that provide a trusted root via `--trusted-root` or when fetched
  automatically from a TUF repository, when no trusted key material is provided via
  `SIGSTORE_REKOR_PUBLIC_KEY`. When using the default flag values in Cosign v3 to
  sign and verify (`--use-signing-config=true` and `--new-bundle-format=true` for
  signing, `--new-bundle-format=true` for verification), users are unaffected. Cosign
  v2 users are affected using the default flag values.\n\nThis issue had previously
  been fixed in https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/security/advisories/GHSA-8gw7-4j42-w388
  but recent refactoring caused a regression. We have added testing to prevent a future
  regression."
