title: "Allstar Reviewbot has Authentication Bypass via Hard-coded Webhook Secret"
description: "A vulnerability in Allstarâ€™s Reviewbot component caused inbound webhook
  requests to be validated against a hard-coded, shared secret:\n\nhttps://github.com/ossf/allstar/blob/294ae985cc2facd0918e8d820e4196021aa0b914/pkg/reviewbot/reviewbot.go#L59\n\nThe
  value used for the secret token was compiled into the Allstar binary and could not
  be configured at runtime. In practice, this meant that every deployment using Reviewbot
  would validate requests with the same secret unless the operator modified source
  code and rebuilt the component - an expectation that is not documented and is easy
  to miss. While Reviewbot is not commonly enabled in standard Allstar setups, we
  are issuing this advisory to reach any environments where it may have been deployed."
