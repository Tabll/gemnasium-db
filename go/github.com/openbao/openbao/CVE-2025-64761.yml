title: "OpenBao is Vulnerable to Privileged Operator Identity Group Root Escalation"
description: "Similar to HCSEC-2025-13 / CVE-2025-5999, a privileged operator could
  use the identity group subsystem to add a root policy to a group identity group,
  escalating their or another user's permissions in the system. Specifically this
  is an issue when:\n\n1. An operator in the root namespace has access to `identity/groups`
  endpoints.\n2. An operator does not have policy access.\n\nOtherwise, an operator
  with policy access could create or modify an existing policy to grant root-equivalent
  permissions through the `sudo` capability."
