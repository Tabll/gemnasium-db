title: "OpenBao has potential Denial of Service vulnerability when processing malicious
  unauthenticated JSON requests"
description: "JSON objects after decoding might use more memory than their serialized
  version. It is possible to tune a JSON to maximize the factor between serialized
  memory usage and deserialized memory usage (similar to a zip bomb). While reproducing
  the issue, we could reach a factor of about 35. This can be used to circumvent the
  [`max_request_size` (https://openbao.org/docs/configuration/listener/tcp/) configuration
  parameter, which is meant to protect against Denial of Service attacks, and also
  makes Denial of Service attacks easier in general, as the attacker needs much less
  resources."
