title: "OpenBao Login MFA Bypass of Rate Limiting and TOTP Token Reuse"
description: "OpenBao's Login Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) system allows enforcing
  MFA using Time-based One Time Password (TOTP). Due to normalization applied by the
  underlying TOTP library, codes were accepted which could contain whitespace; this
  whitespace could bypass internal rate limiting of the MFA method and allow reuse
  of existing MFA codes."
