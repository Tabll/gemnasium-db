title: "OpenBao and Vault Leak []byte Fields in Audit Logs "
description: "OpenBao's audit log did not appropriately redact fields when relevant
  subsystems sent `[]byte` response parameters rather than `string`s. This includes,
  but is not limited to:\n\n- `sys/raw` with use of `encoding=base64`, all data would
  be emitted unredacted to the audit log.\n- Transit, when performing a signing operation
  with a derived Ed25519 key, would emit public keys to the audit log.\n\nThird-party
  plugins may be affected.\n\nThis issue has been present since HashiCorp Vault and
  continues to impact Vault as of v1.20.4."
