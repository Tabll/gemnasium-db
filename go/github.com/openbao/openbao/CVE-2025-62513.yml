title: "OpenBao leaks HTTPRawBody in Audit Logs"
description: "OpenBao's audit log experienced a regression wherein raw HTTP bodies
  used by few endpoints were not correctly redacted (HMAC'd).  This impacted the following
  subsystems:\n\n- When using the ACME functionality of PKI, this would result in
  short-lived ACME verification challenge codes being leaked in the audit logs.\n-
  When using the OIDC issuer functionality of the identity subsystem, auth and token
  response codes along with claims could be leaked in the audit logs.\n\nThird-party
  plugins may be affected."
