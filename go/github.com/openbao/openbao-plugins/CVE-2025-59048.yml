title: "OpenBao AWS Plugin Vulnerable to Cross-Account IAM Role Impersonation in AWS
  Auth Method"
description: "This is a cross-account impersonation vulnerability in the `auth-aws`
  plugin. The vulnerability allows an IAM role from an untrusted AWS account to authenticate
  by impersonating a role with the **same name** in a trusted account, leading to
  unauthorized access.\n\nThis impacts all users of the `auth-aws` plugin who operate
  in a multi-account AWS environment where IAM role names may not be unique across
  accounts.\n\nThe core of the vulnerability is a flawed caching mechanism that fails
  to validate the AWS Account ID during authentication. While the use of wildcards
  in a `bound_iam_principal_arn configuration` significantly increases the attack
  surface, **wildcards are not a prerequisite for exploitation**. The vulnerability
  can be exploited with specific ARN bindings if a role name collision occurs.\n\nSuccessful
  exploitation can lead to unauthorized access to secrets, data exfiltration, and
  privilege escalation. Given that the only prerequisite is a duplicate role name,
  the severity is considered **high**."
