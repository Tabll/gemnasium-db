title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "Crossplane is a framework for building cloud native control planes without
  needing to write code. In versions prior to 1.11.5, 1.12.3, and 1.13.0, a high-privileged
  user could create a Package referencing an arbitrarily large image containing that
  Crossplane would then parse, possibly resulting in exhausting all the available
  memory and therefore in the container being OOMKilled. The impact is limited due
  to the high privileges required to be able to create the Package and the eventually
  consistency nature of controller. This issue is fixed in versions 1.11.5, 1.12.3,
  and 1.13.0."
