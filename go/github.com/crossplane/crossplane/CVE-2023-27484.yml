title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "crossplane-runtime is a set of go libraries used to build Kubernetes
  controllers in Crossplane and its related stacks. In affected versions an already
  highly privileged user able to create or update Compositions can specify an arbitrarily
  high index in a patch's `ToFieldPath`, which could lead to excessive memory usage
  once such Composition is selected for a Composite resource. Compositions allow users
  to specify patches inserting elements into arrays at an arbitrary index. When a
  Composition is selected for a Composite Resource, patches are evaluated and if a
  specified index is greater than the current size of the target slice, Crossplane
  will grow that slice up to the specified index, which could lead to an excessive
  amount of memory usage and therefore the Pod being OOM-Killed. The index is already
  capped to the maximum value for a uint32 (4294967295) when parsed, but that is still
  an unnecessarily large value. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.11.2,
  1.10.3, and 1.9.2. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade can restrict
  write privileges on Compositions to only admin users as a workaround."
