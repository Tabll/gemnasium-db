title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "crossplane-runtime is a set of go libraries used to build Kubernetes
  controllers in Crossplane and its related stacks. An out of memory panic vulnerability
  has been discovered in affected versions. Applications that use the `Paved` type's
  `SetValue` method with user provided input without proper validation might use excessive
  amounts of memory and cause an out of memory panic. In the fieldpath package, the
  Paved.SetValue method sets a value on the Paved object according to the provided
  path, without any validation. This allows setting values in slices at any provided
  index, which grows the target array up to the requested index, the index is currently
  capped at max uint32 (4294967295) given how indexes are parsed, but that is still
  an unnecessarily large value. If callers are not validating paths' indexes on their
  own, which most probably are not going to do, given that the input is parsed directly
  in the SetValue method, this could allow users to consume arbitrary amounts of memory.
  Applications that do not use the `Paved` type's `SetValue` method are not affected.
  This issue has been addressed in versions 0.16.1 and 0.19.2. Users are advised to
  upgrade. Users unable to upgrade can parse and validate the path before passing
  it to the `SetValue` method of the `Paved` type, constraining the index size as
  deemed appropriate."
