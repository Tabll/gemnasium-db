package_slug: "go/github.com/cilium/hubble"
title: "Character injection in Hubble CLI"
description: "A network attacker could inject malicious control characters into Hubble
  CLI terminal output, potentially leading to loss of integrity and manipulation of
  the output. This could be leveraged to conceal log entries, rewrite output, or even
  make the terminal temporarily unusable. Exploitation of this attack would require
  the victim to be monitoring Kafka traffic using [Layer 7 Protocol Visibility](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/observability/visibility/#layer-7-protocol-visibility)
  at the time of the attack."
