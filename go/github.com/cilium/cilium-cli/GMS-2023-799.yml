title: "`cilium-cli` disables etcd authorization for clustermesh clusters"
description: "### Impact\n\n`cilium-cli`, when used to configure cluster mesh functionality,
  can remove the enforcement of user permissions on the `etcd` store used to mirror
  local cluster information to remote clusters. \n\nDue to an incorrect mount point
  specification, the settings specified by the `initContainer` that configures `etcd`
  users and their permissions are overwritten when using `cilium-cli` to configure
  a cluster mesh. An attacker who has already gained access to a valid key and certificate
  for an `etcd` cluster compromised in this manner could then modify state in that
  `etcd` cluster.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue is patched in `cilium-cli` 0.13.2\n\nAll
  previous versions of `cilium-cli` are affected. Users who have set up cluster meshes
  using the Cilium Helm chart are not affected.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUse Cilium's
  [Helm charts](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/cilium/cilium) to create your
  cluster instead.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThe Cilium community has worked together
  with members of Isovalent to prepare these mitigations. Special thanks to Marco
  Iorio for investigating and fixing the issue.\n\n### For more information\nIf you
  have any questions or comments about this advisory, please reach out on [Slack](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/community/community/#slack).\n\nAs
  usual, if you think you found a related vulnerability, we strongly encourage you
  to report security vulnerabilities to our private security mailing list: [security@cilium.io](mailto:security@cilium.io)
  - first, before disclosing them in any public forums. This is a private mailing
  list where only members of the Cilium internal security team are subscribed to,
  and is treated as top priority."
