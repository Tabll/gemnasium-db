title: "Cilium has insecure IPsec transport encryption"
description: "Users of [IPsec transparent encryption](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/network/encryption-ipsec/)
  in Cilium may be vulnerable to cryptographic attacks that render the transparent
  encryption ineffective.\n\nIn particular, Cilium is vulnerable to the following
  attacks by a man-in-the-middle attacker:\n\n- Chosen plaintext attacks\n- Key recovery
  attacks\n- Replay attacks\n\nThese attacks are possible due to an ESP sequence number
  collision when multiple nodes are configured with the same key. Fixed versions of
  Cilium use unique keys for each IPsec tunnel established between nodes, resolving
  all of the above attacks.\n\n**Important:** After upgrading, users must perform
  a key rotation using the instructions [here](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/security/network/encryption-ipsec/#key-rotation)
  to ensure that they are no longer vulnerable to this issue. Please note that the
  key rotation instructions have recently been updated, and users must use the new
  instructions to properly establish secure IPsec tunnels. To validate that the new
  instructions have been followed properly, ensure that the IPsec Kubernetes secret
  contains a \"+\" sign."
