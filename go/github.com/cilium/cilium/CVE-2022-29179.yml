title: "Improper Privilege Management"
description: "Cilium is open source software for providing and securing network connectivity
  and loadbalancing between application workloads. Prior to versions 1.9.16, 1.10.11,
  and 1.11.15, if an attacker is able to perform a container escape of a container
  running as root on a host where Cilium is installed, the attacker can escalate privileges
  to cluster admin by using Cilium's Kubernetes service account. The problem has been
  fixed and the patch is available in versions 1.9.16, 1.10.11, and 1.11.5. There
  are no known workarounds available."
