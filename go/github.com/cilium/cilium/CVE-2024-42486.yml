title: "Cilium leaks information via incorrect ReferenceGrant update logic in Gateway
  API"
description: "Due to ReferenceGrant changes not being immediately propagated in Cilium's
  GatewayAPI controller, Gateway resources are able to access secrets in other namespaces
  after the associated ReferenceGrant has been revoked. This can lead to Gateways
  continuing to establish sessions using secrets that they should no longer have access
  to."
