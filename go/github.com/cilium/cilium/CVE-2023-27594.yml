package_slug: "go/github.com/cilium/cilium"
title: "Improper Authorization"
description: "Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an
  eBPF-based dataplane. Prior to versions 1.11.15, 1.12.8, and 1.13.1, under specific
  conditions, Cilium may misattribute the source IP address of traffic to a cluster,
  identifying external traffic as coming from the host on which Cilium is running.
  As a consequence, network policies for that cluster might be bypassed, depending
  on the specific network policies enabled. This issue only manifests when Cilium
  is routing IPv6 traffic and NodePorts are used to route traffic to pods. IPv6 and
  endpoint routes are both disabled by default. The problem has been fixed and is
  available on versions 1.11.15, 1.12.8, and 1.13.1. As a workaround, disable IPv6
  routing."
