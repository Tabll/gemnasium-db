title: "Potential HTTP policy bypass when using header rules in Cilium"
description: "### Impact\n\nThis issue only impacts users who:\n\n- Have a HTTP policy
  that applies to multiple `toEndpoints` AND\n- Have an allow-all rule in place that
  affects only one of those endpoints\n\nIn such cases, a wildcard rule will be appended
  to the set of HTTP rules, which could cause bypass of HTTP policies."
