title: "Cilium's Layer 7 policy enforcement may not occur in policies with wildcarded
  port ranges"
description: "For users with the following configuration:\n\n* An allow policy that
  selects a [Layer 3 destination](https://docs.cilium.io/en/v1.14/security/policy/language/#layer-3-examples)
  and a [port range](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/policy/language/#example-port-ranges)
  **AND**\n* A [Layer 7 allow policy](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/security/policy/language/#layer-7-examples)
  that selects a specific port within the first policy's range\n\nthen Layer 7 enforcement
  would not occur for the traffic selected by the Layer 7 policy.\n\nThis issue only
  affects users who use Cilium's port range functionality, which was introduced in
  Cilium v1.16.\n\nFor reference, an example of a pair of policies that would trigger
  this issue is:\n\n```\napiVersion: \"cilium.io/v2\"\nkind: CiliumNetworkPolicy\nmetadata:\nname:
  \"l3-port-range-rule\"\nspec:\nendpointSelector:\nmatchLabels:\napp: service\ningress:\n-
  fromCIDR:\n- 192.168.60.0/24\ntoPorts:\n- ports:\n- port: \"80\"\nendPort: 444\nprotocol:
  TCP\n```\nand\n```\napiVersion: \"cilium.io/v2\"\nkind: CiliumNetworkPolicy\nmetadata:\nname:
  \"l7-port-range-rule\"\nspec:\nendpointSelector:\nmatchLabels:\napp: service\ningress:\ntoPorts:\n-
  ports:\n- port: \"80\"\nprotocol: TCP\nrules:\nhttp:\n- method: \"GET\"\npath: \"/public\"\n```\n\nIn
  the above example, requests would be permitted to all HTTP paths on matching endpoints,
  rather than just `GET` requests to the `/public` path as intentded by the `l7-port-range-rule`
  policy. In patched versions of Cilium, the `l7-port-range-rule` would take precedence
  over the `l3-port-range-rule`."
