title: "Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions"
description: "Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an
  eBPF-based dataplane. In version 1.13.0, when Cilium is started, there is a short
  period when Cilium eBPF programs are not attached to the host. During this period,
  the host does not implement any of Cilium's featureset. This can cause disruption
  to newly established connections during this period due to the lack of Load Balancing,
  or can cause Network Policy bypass due to the lack of Network Policy enforcement
  during the window. This vulnerability impacts any Cilium-managed endpoints on the
  node (such as Kubernetes Pods), as well as the host network namespace (including
  Host Firewall). This vulnerability is fixed in Cilium 1.13.1 or later. Cilium releases
  1.12.x, 1.11.x, and earlier are not affected. There are no known workarounds."
