title: "Kubernetes users may update Pod labels to bypass network policy"
description: "### Impact\n\nAn attacker with the ability to update pod labels can
  cause Cilium to apply incorrect network policies.\n\nThis issue arises due to the
  fact that on pod update, Cilium incorrectly uses user-provided pod labels to select
  the policies which apply to the workload in question.\n\nThis can affect:\n\n* Cilium
  network policies that use the namespace, service account or cluster constructs to
  restrict traffic\n* Cilium clusterwide network policies that use Cilium namespace
  labels to select the Pod\n* Kubernetes network policies\n\nNon-existent construct
  names can be provided, which bypass all network policies applicable to the construct.
  For example, providing a pod with a non-existent namespace as the value of the `io.kubernetes.pod.namespace`
  label results in none of the namespaced CiliumNetworkPolicies applying to the pod
  in question.\n\nThis attack requires the attacker to have [Kubernetes API Server
  access](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/security/threat-model/#kubernetes-api-server-attacker),
  as described in the Cilium Threat Model.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue affects:\n\n-
  Cilium <= v1.14.1\n- Cilium <= v1.13.6\n- Cilium <= v1.12.13\n\nThis issue has been
  resolved in:\n\n- Cilium v1.14.2\n- Cilium v1.13.7\n- Cilium v1.12.14\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAn
  admission webhook can be used to prevent pod label updates to the `k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace`
  and `io.cilium.k8s.policy.*` keys.\n\n### Acknowledgements\nThe Cilium community
  has worked together with members of Palantir and Isovalent to prepare these mitigations.
  Special thanks to @odinuge for reporting this issue and to @nebril for the fix.\n\n###
