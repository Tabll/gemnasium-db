title: "Cilium East-west traffic not subject to egress policy enforcement for requests
  via Gateway API load balancers"
description: "For Cilium users who:\n- Use Gateway API for Ingress for some services
  **AND**\n- Use [LB-IPAM](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/network/lb-ipam/) or BGP
  for LB Service implementation **AND**\n- Use network policies to block egress traffic
  from workloads in a namespace to workloads in other namespaces\n\nEgress traffic
