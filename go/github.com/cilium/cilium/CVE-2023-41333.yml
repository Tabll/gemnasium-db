title: "Cilium vulnerable to bypass of namespace restrictions in CiliumNetworkPolicy "
description: "### Impact\n\nAn attacker with the ability to create or modify CiliumNetworkPolicy
  objects in a particular namespace is able to affect traffic on an entire Cilium
  cluster, potentially bypassing policy enforcement in other namespaces.\n\nBy using
  a crafted `endpointSelector` that uses the `DoesNotExist` operator on the `reserved:init`
  label, the attacker can create policies that bypass namespace restrictions and affect
  the entire Cilium cluster. This includes potentially allowing or denying all traffic.\n\nThis
  attack requires API server access, as described in the 
  [Kubernetes API Server Attacker](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/threat-model/#kubernetes-api-server-attacker)
  section of the Cilium Threat Model.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue was patched in
  https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/28007\n\nThis issue affects:\n\n- Cilium <=
  v1.14.1\n- Cilium <= v1.13.6\n- Cilium <= v1.12.13\n\nThis issue has been resolved
  in:\n\n- Cilium v1.14.2\n- Cilium v1.13.7\n- Cilium v1.12.14\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAn
  admission webhook can be used to prevent the use of `endpointSelector`s that use
  the `DoesNotExist` operator on the `reserved:init` label in CiliumNetworkPolicies.\n\n###
  Acknowledgements\nThe Cilium community has worked together with members of Palantir
  and Isovalent to prepare these mitigations. Special thanks to @odinuge for reporting
  this issue and @joestringer for the fix.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have
