title: "Unencrypted traffic between nodes when using IPsec and L7 policies"
description: "In Cilium clusters with IPsec enabled and traffic matching Layer 7 policies:\n\n-
  Traffic that should be IPsec-encrypted between a node's Envoy proxy and pods on
  other nodes is sent unencrypted\n- Traffic that should be IPsec-encrypted between
  a node's DNS proxy and pods on other nodes is sent unencrypted\n\n**Note:** For
  clusters running in native routing mode, IPsec encryption is not applied to connections
  which are selected by a L7 Egress Network Policy or a DNS Policy. This is a known
  limitation of Cilium's IPsec encryption which will continue to apply after upgrading
  to the latest Cilium versions described below."
