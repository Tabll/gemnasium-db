title: "Cilium has an information leakage via insecure default Hubble UI CORS header"
description: "For users who deploy Hubble UI using either Cilium CLI or via the Cilium
  Helm chart, an insecure default `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header value could
  lead to sensitive data exposure. A user with access to a Hubble UI instance affected
  by this issue could leak configuration details about the Kubernetes cluster which
  Hubble UI is monitoring, including node names, IP addresses, and other metadata
  about workloads and the cluster networking configuration. In order for this vulnerability
  to be exploited, a victim would have to first visit a malicious page."
