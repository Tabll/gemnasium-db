title: "Network Policies & (Clusterwide) Cilium Network Policies with namespace label
  selectors may unexpectedly select pods with maliciously crafted labels"
description: "If a user has Network Policies with namespace selectors
  selecting labels of namespaces, or (clusterwide) Cilium Network Policies matching
  on namespace labels, then it is possible for an attacker with Kubernetes pod deploy
  rights (either directly or indirectly via higher-level APIs such as Deployment,
  Daemonset etc) to craft additional pod labels such that the pod is selected by another
  policy that exists rather than the expected policy."
