package_slug: "go/github.com/cilium/cilium"
title: "Cilium with misconfigured toGroups in policies can lead to unrestricted egress
  traffic"
description: "`CiliumNetworkPolicy`s which use `egress.toGroups.aws.securityGroupsIds`
  to reference AWS security group IDs that do not exist or are not attached to any
  network interface may unintentionally allow broader outbound access than intended
  by the policy authors. In such cases, the toCIDRset section of the derived policy
  is not generated, which means outbound traffic may be permitted to more destinations
  than originally intended."
