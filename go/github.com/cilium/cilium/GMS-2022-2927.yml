title: "Cilium host policy bypass in endpoint-routes mode with dual-stack"
description: "This vulnerability allows bypassing host policies for IPv6 traffic 
  coming from a Cilium-managed pod and destined to the host-network namespace 
  (e.g., to a host-network pod). Host policy enforcement on IPv4 or for traffic 
  coming from outside the node is not affected.
  Cilium is only affected by this vulnerability if IPv4, IPv6, endpoint routes, 
  and the host firewall are enabled. Note that endpoint routes are typically only 
  enabled in GKE, EKS, AKS, and OpenShift; in those environments, IPv6 is typically 
  disabled. Host firewall is disabled by default."
