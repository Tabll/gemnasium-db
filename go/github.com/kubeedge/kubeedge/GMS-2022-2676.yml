title: "CloudCore CSI Driver: Malicious response from KubeEdge can crash CSI Driver
  controller server"
description: "### Impact\nA malicious message response from KubeEdge can crash the
  CSI Driver controller server by triggering a nil-pointer dereference panic. As a
  consequence, the CSI Driver controller will be in denial of service. An attacker
  would already need to be an authenticated user of the Cloud, and only when the authenticated
  user launches the `csidriver` then CloudCore may be attacked.\n\n### Patches\nThis
  bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.0, 1.10.1, and 1.9.3. Users should update to
  these versions to resolve the issue.\n\n### Workarounds\nAt the time of writing,
  no workaround exists.\n\n### References\nNA\n\n### Credits\nThanks David Korczynski
