title: "CloudCore UDS Server: Malicious Message can crash CloudCore"
description: "### Impact\nA malicious message can crash CloudCore by triggering a
  null-pointer dereference in the UDS Server. Since the UDS Server only communicates
  with the CSI Driver on the cloud side, the attack is limited to the local host network.
  As such, an attacker would already need to be an authenticated user of the Cloud.\n
  \nIt will be affected only when users turn on the unixsocket switch in the config
  file `cloudcore.yaml` as below:\n```\nmodules:\n cloudHub:\n  ...\n  unixsocket:\n
  \  address: xxx\n   enable: true\n```\n\n### Patches\nThis bug has been fixed in
  Kubeedge 1.11.0, 1.10.1, and 1.9.3. Users should update to these versions to resolve
  the issue.\n\n### Workarounds\nDisable the unixsocket switch of CloudHub in the
  config file `cloudcore.yaml`.\n\n### References\nNA\n\n### Credits\nThanks David
  Korczynski and Adam Korczynski of ADA Logics for responsibly disclosing this issue
  in accordance with the [kubeedge security policy](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/security/policy)
  during a security audit sponsored by CNCF and facilitated by OSTIF.\n\n### For more
