title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized
  application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1,
  1.10.2, and 1.9.4, several endpoints in the Cloud AdmissionController may be susceptible
  to a DoS attack if an HTTP request containing a very large Body is sent to it. The
  consequence of the exhaustion is that the Cloud AdmissionController will be in denial
  of service. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. There
  is currently no known workaround."
