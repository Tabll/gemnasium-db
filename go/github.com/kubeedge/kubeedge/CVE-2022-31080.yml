package_slug: "go/github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge"
title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized
  application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1,
  1.10.2, and 1.9.4, a large response received by the viaduct WSClient can cause a
  DoS from memory exhaustion. The entire body of the response is being read into memory
  which could allow an attacker to send a request that returns a response with a large
  body. The consequence of the exhaustion is that the process which invokes a WSClient
  will be in a denial of service. The software is affected If users who are authenticated
  to the edge side connect to `cloudhub` from the edge side through WebSocket protocol.
  This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. There are currently
  no known workarounds."
