title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized
  application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1,
  1.10.2, and 1.9.4, EdgeCore may be susceptible to a DoS attack on CloudHub if an
  attacker was to send a well-crafted HTTP request to `/edge.crt`. If an attacker
  can send a well-crafted HTTP request to CloudHub, and that request has a very large
  body, that request can crash the HTTP service through a memory exhaustion vector.
  The request body is being read into memory, and a body that is larger than the available
  memory can lead to a successful attack. Because the request would have to make it
  through authorization, only authorized users may perform this attack. The consequence
  of the exhaustion is that CloudHub will be in denial of service. KubeEdge is affected
  only when users enable the CloudHub module in the file `cloudcore.yaml`. This bug
  has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. As a workaround, disable the
  CloudHub switch in the config file `cloudcore.yaml`."
