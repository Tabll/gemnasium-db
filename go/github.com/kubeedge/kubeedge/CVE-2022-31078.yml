title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized
  application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1,
  1.10.2, and 1.9.4, the CloudCore Router does not impose a limit on the size of responses
  to requests made by the REST handler. An attacker could use this weakness to make
  a request that will return an HTTP response with a large body and cause DoS of CloudCore.
  In the HTTP Handler API, the rest handler makes a request to a pre-specified handle.
  The handle will return an HTTP response that is then read into memory. The consequence
  of the exhaustion is that CloudCore will be in a denial of service. Only an authenticated
  user of the cloud can make an attack. It will be affected only when users enable
  `router` module in the config file `cloudcore.yaml`. This bug has been fixed in
  Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. As a workaround, disable the router switch in
  the config file `cloudcore.yaml`."
