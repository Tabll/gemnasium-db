title: "Go Snowflake Driver has race condition when checking access to Easy Logging
  configuration file"
description: "# Issue\nSnowflake discovered and remediated a vulnerability in the
  Go Snowflake Driver (“Driver”). When using the Easy Logging feature on Linux and
  macOS, the Driver didn’t correctly verify the permissions of the logging configuration
  file, potentially allowing an attacker with local access to overwrite the configuration
  and gain control over logging level and output location.\n\nThis vulnerability affects
  Driver versions from 1.7.0 up to, but not including, 1.13.3. Snowflake fixed the
  issue in version 1.13.3.\n\n# Vulnerability Details\nWhen using the Easy Logging
  feature on Linux and macOS, the Driver reads logging configuration from a user-provided
  file. On Linux and macOS the Driver verifies that the configuration file can be
  written to only by its owner. That check was vulnerable to a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use
  (TOCTOU) race condition and failed to verify that the file owner matches the user
  running the Driver. This could allow a local attacker with write access to the configuration
  file or the directory containing it to overwrite the configuration and gain control
  over logging level and output location.\n\n# Solution\nSnowflake released version
  1.13.3 of the Go Snowflake Driver, which fixes this issue. We recommend users upgrade
  to version 1.13.3.\n\n# Additional Information\nIf you discover a security vulnerability
  in one of our products or websites, please report the issue to Snowflake through
  our Vulnerability Disclosure Program hosted at HackerOne. For more information,
  please see our [Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://hackerone.com/snowflake?type=team)."
