title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')"
description: "gosnowflake is the Snowflake Golang driver. Prior to version 1.6.19,
  a command injection vulnerability exists in the Snowflake Golang driver via single
  sign-on (SSO) browser URL authentication. In order to exploit the potential for
  command injection, an attacker would need to be successful in (1) establishing a
  malicious resource and (2) redirecting users to utilize the resource. The attacker
  could set up a malicious, publicly accessible server which responds to the SSO URL
  with an attack payload. If the attacker then tricked a user into visiting the maliciously
  crafted connection URL, the userâ€™s local machine would render the malicious payload,
  leading to a remote code execution. This attack scenario can be mitigated through
  URL allow listing as well as common anti-phishing resources. A patch is available
  in version 1.6.19."
