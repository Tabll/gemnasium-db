title: "Moby (Docker Engine) is vulnerable to Ambiguous OCI manifest parsing"
description: "In the OCI Distribution Specification version 1.0.0 and prior and in
  the OCI Image Specification version 1.0.1 and prior, manifest and index documents
  are ambiguous without an accompanying Content-Type HTTP header.  Versions of Moby
  (Docker Engine) prior to 20.10.11 treat the Content-Type header as trusted and deserialize
  the document according to that header.  If the Content-Type header changed between
  pulls of the same ambiguous document (with the same digest), the document may be
  interpreted differently, meaning that the digest alone is insufficient to unambiguously
  identify the content of the image."
