package_slug: "go/github.com/moby/moby"
title: "Improper Certificate Validation"
description: "An issue was discovered in Docker Moby before 17.06.0. The Docker engine
  validated a client TLS certificate using both the configured client CA root certificate
  and all system roots on non-Windows systems. This allowed a client with any domain
  validated certificate signed by a system-trusted root CA (as opposed to one signed
  by the configured CA root certificate) to authenticate."
