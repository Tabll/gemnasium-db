title: "Incorrect Authorization"
description: "Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable software
  containerization. A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) where supplementary groups
  are not set up properly. If an attacker has direct access to a container and manipulates
  their supplementary group access, they may be able to use supplementary group access
  to bypass primary group restrictions in some cases, potentially gaining access to
  sensitive information or gaining the ability to execute code in that container.
  This bug is fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.18. Running containers should be
  stopped and restarted for the permissions to be fixed. For users unable to upgrade,
  this problem can be worked around by not using the `\"USER $USERNAME\"` Dockerfile
  instruction. Instead by calling `ENTRYPOINT [\"su\", \"-\", \"user\"]` the supplementary
  groups will be set up properly."
