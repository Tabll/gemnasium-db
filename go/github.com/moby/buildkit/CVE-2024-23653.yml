title: "Incorrect Authorization"
description: "BuildKit is a toolkit for converting source code to build artifacts
  in an efficient, expressive and repeatable manner. In addition to running containers
  as build steps, BuildKit also provides APIs for running interactive containers based
  on built images. It was possible to use these APIs to ask BuildKit to run a container
  with elevated privileges. Normally, running such containers is only allowed if special
  `security.insecure` entitlement is enabled both by buildkitd configuration and allowed
  by the user initializing the build request. The issue has been fixed in v0.12.5
  . Avoid using BuildKit frontends from untrusted sources. \n"
