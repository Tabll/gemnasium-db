title: "opa-envoy-plugin has a Authorization Bypass via Double-Slash Path Misinterpretation
  in input.parsed_path"
description: "A security vulnerability has been discovered in how the `input.parsed_path`
  field is constructed. HTTP request paths are treated as full URIs when parsed; interpreting
  leading path segments prefixed with double slashes (`//`) as [authority](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-3.2)
  components, and therefore dropping them from the parsed path. This creates a path
  interpretation mismatch between authorization policies and backend servers, enabling
  attackers to bypass access controls by crafting requests where the authorization
  filter evaluates a different path than the one ultimately served."
