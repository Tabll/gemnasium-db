title: "Horcrux Double Sign Possibility"
description: "On March 6, 2025, a Horcrux user (01node) experienced a double-signing
  incident on the Osmosis network, resulting in a 5% slash penalty (approximately
  75,000 OSMO or $20,000 USD). After thorough investigation, we have identified a
  race condition in Horcrux's signature state handling as the root cause. This vulnerability
  was introduced in July 2023 as part of PR [\\#169](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/horcrux/pull/169)
  and affects all Horcrux versions from v3.1.0 through v3.3.1. A fix has been developed
  and is being deployed immediately."
