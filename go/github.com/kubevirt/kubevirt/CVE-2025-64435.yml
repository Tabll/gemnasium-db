title: "KubeVirt VMI Denial-of-Service (DoS) Using Pod Impersonation"
description: "_Short summary of the problem. Make the impact and severity as clear
  as possible.\n\nA logic flaw in the `virt-controller` allows an attacker to disrupt
  the control over a running VMI by creating a pod with the same labels as the legitimate
  `virt-launcher` pod associated with the VMI. This can mislead the `virt-controller`
  into associating the fake pod with the VMI, resulting in incorrect status updates
  and potentially causing a DoS (Denial-of-Service)."
