identifier: "CVE-2020-14316"
package_slug: "go/github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt"
title: "Improper Privilege Management"
description: "Virtual Machine Instances (VMIs) can be used to gain access to the host's
  filesystem. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to assume the privileges
  of the VM process on the host system. In worst-case scenarios an attacker can read
  and modify any file on the system where the VMI is running. The highest threat from
  this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
