title: "KubeVirt Vulnerable to Arbitrary Host File Read and Write"
description: "The `hostDisk` feature in KubeVirt allows mounting a host file or directory
  owned by the user with UID 107 into a VM. However, the implementation of this feature
  and more specifically the `DiskOrCreate` option which creates a file if it doesn't
  exist, has a logic bug that allows an attacker to read and write arbitrary files
  owned by more privileged users on the host system."
