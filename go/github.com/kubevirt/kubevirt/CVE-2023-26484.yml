title: "Incorrect Authorization"
description: "KubeVirt is a virtual machine management add-on for Kubernetes. In versions
  0.59.0 and prior, if a malicious user has taken over a Kubernetes node where virt-handler
  (the KubeVirt node-daemon) is running, the virt-handler service account can be used
  to modify all node specs. This can be misused to lure-in system-level-privileged
  components which can, for instance, read all secrets on the cluster, or can exec
  into pods on other nodes. This way, a compromised node can be used to elevate privileges
  beyond the node until potentially having full privileged access to the whole cluster.
  The simplest way to exploit this, once a user could compromise a specific node,
  is to set with the virt-handler service account all other nodes to unschedulable
  and simply wait until system-critical components with high privileges appear on
  its node. No patches are available as of time of publication. As a workaround, gatekeeper
  users can add a webhook which will block the `virt-handler` service account to modify
  the spec of a node."
