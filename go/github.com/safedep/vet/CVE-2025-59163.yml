title: "vet MCP Server SSE Transport DNS Rebinding Vulnerability"
description: "SafeDep `vet` is vulnerable to a DNS rebinding attack due to lack of
  HTTP `Host` and `Origin` header validation.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability following
  conditions must be met:\n\n1. A `vet` scan is executed and reports are saved as
  `sqlite3` database\n2. A `vet` MCP server is running on default port with SSE transport
  that has access to the report database\n3. The attacker lures the victim to attacker
  controlled website\n4. Attacker leverages DNS rebinding to access `vet` SSE server
  on `127.0.0.1` through the website\n5. Attacker uses MCP tools to read information
  from report database"
