title: "kcp's impersonation allows access to global administrative groups"
description: "[Impersonation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#user-impersonation)
  is a feature of the Kubernetes API, allowing to override user information. As downstream
  project, kcp inherits this feature. As per the linked documentation a specific level
  of privilege (usually assigned to cluster admins) is required for impersonation.\n\nThe
  vulnerability in kcp affects kcp installations in which users are granted the `cluster-admin`
  ClusterRole (or comparably high permission levels that grant impersonation access;
  the verb in question is `impersonate`) within their respective workspaces. As kcp
  builds around self-service confined within workspaces, most installations would
  likely grant such workspace access to their users. Such users can impersonate special
  global administrative groups, which circumvent parts of the authorizer chains, e.g.
  [maximal permission policies](https://docs.kcp.io/kcp/v0.26/concepts/apis/exporting-apis/#maximal-permission-policy)."
