description: "go-bitfield is a simple bitfield package for the go language aiming
  to be more performant that the standard library. When feeding untrusted user input
  into the size parameter of `NewBitfield` and `FromBytes` functions, an attacker
  can trigger `panic`s. This happen when the `size` is a not a multiple of `8` or
  is negative. There were already a note in the `NewBitfield` documentation, however
  known users of this package are subject to this issue. Users are advised to upgrade.
  Users unable to upgrade should ensure that `size` is a multiple of 8 before calling
  `NewBitfield` or `FromBytes`."
