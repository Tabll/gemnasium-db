title: "Unchecked Return Value"
description: "go-merkledag implements the 'DAGService' interface and adds two ipld
  node types, Protobuf and Raw for the ipfs project. A `ProtoNode` may be modified
  in such a way as to cause various encode errors which will trigger a panic on common
  method calls that don't allow for error returns. A `ProtoNode` should only be able
  to encode to valid DAG-PB, attempting to encode invalid DAG-PB forms will result
  in an error from the codec. Manipulation of an existing (newly created or decoded)
  `ProtoNode` using the modifier methods does not account for certain states that
  would place the `ProtoNode` into an unencodeable form. Due to conformance with the
  [`github.com/ipfs/go-block-format#Block`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ipfs/go-block-format#Block)
  and [`github.com/ipfs/go-ipld-format#Node`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ipfs/go-ipld-format#Node)
  interfaces, certain methods, which internally require a re-encode if state has changed,
  will panic due to the inability to return an error. This issue has been addressed
  across a number of pull requests. Users are advised to upgrade to version 0.8.1
  for a complete set of fixes. Users unable to upgrade may attempt to mitigate this
  issue by sanitising inputs when allowing user-input to set a new `CidBuilder` on
  a `ProtoNode` and by sanitising `Tsize` (`Link#Size`) values such that they are
  a reasonable byte-size for sub-DAGs where derived from user-input."
