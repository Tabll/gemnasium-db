description: "go-unixfs is an implementation of a unix-like filesystem on top of an
  ipld merkledag. Trying to read malformed HAMT sharded directories can cause panics
  and virtual memory leaks. If you are reading untrusted user input, an attacker can
  then trigger a panic. This is caused by bogus `fanout` parameter in the HAMT directory
  nodes. Users are advised to upgrade to version 0.4.3 to resolve this issue. Users
  unable to upgrade should not feed untrusted user data to the decoding functions."
