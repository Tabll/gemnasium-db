title: "DOS and excessive memory usage when passing untrusted user input to to dag
  import"
description: "go-ipfs nodes crash when trying to import certain malformed CAR files
  due to an issue in the go-car dependency. This impacts nodes running ipfs dag import
  on untrusted user inputs, for example, pinning services with a car ingest endpoint.
  This include the corresponding HTTP RPC API v0/dag/import endpoint. An attacker
  controlling the car file passed in can also make the node allocate arbitrary sized
  buffers creating memory exhaustion attacks."
