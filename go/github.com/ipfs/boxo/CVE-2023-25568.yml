title: "Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling"
description: "Boxo, formerly known as go-libipfs, is a library for building IPFS applications
  and implementations. In versions 0.4.0 and 0.5.0, if an attacker is able allocate
  arbitrary many bytes in the Bitswap server, those allocations are lasting even if
  the connection is closed. This affects users accepting untrusted connections with
  the Bitswap server and also affects users using the old API stubs at `github.com/ipfs/go-libipfs/bitswap`
  because users then transitively import `github.com/ipfs/go-libipfs/bitswap/server`.
  Boxo versions 0.6.0 and 0.4.1 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, those
  who are using the stub object at `github.com/ipfs/go-libipfs/bitswap` not taking
  advantage of the features provided by the server can refactor their code to use
  the new split API that will allow them to run in a client only mode: `github.com/ipfs/go-libipfs/bitswap/client`."
