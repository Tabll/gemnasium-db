title: "github.com/ipfs/kubo affected by DOS Bitswap unbounded persistent memory leak"
description: "An attacker is able allocate arbitrarily many bytes in the
  Bitswap server by sending many `WANT_BLOCK` and or `WANT_HAVE` requests which are
  queued in an unbounded queue, with allocations that persist even if the connection
  is closed.\n\nThis affects users accepting or connecting untrusted connections such
  as by running in the public swarm and no pnet config.\nNodes that are not publicly
  reachable but connects to untrusted nodes are also vulnerable to the untrusted nodes
  being connected to since libp2p connections are blindly bidirectional."
