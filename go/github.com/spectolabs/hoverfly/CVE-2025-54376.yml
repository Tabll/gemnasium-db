title: "WebSocket endpoint `/api/v2/ws/logs` reachable without authentication even
  when --auth is enabled"
description: "Hoverflyâ€™s admin WebSocket endpoint /api/v2/ws/logs is not protected
  by the same authentication middleware that guards the REST admin API.\nConsequently,
  an unauthenticated remote attacker can:\n\n- Stream real-time application logs (information
  disclosure).\n- Gain insight into internal file paths, request/response bodies,
  and other potentially sensitive data emitted in logs."
