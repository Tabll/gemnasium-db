title: "Coder's OIDC authentication allows email with partially matching domain to
  register"
description: "### Summary\nA vulnerability in Coder's OIDC authentication could allow
  an attacker to bypass the `CODER_OIDC_EMAIL_DOMAIN` verification and create an account
  with an email not in the allowlist. Deployments are only affected if the OIDC provider
  allows users to create accounts on the provider (such as public providers like `google.com`).\n\n###
  Details\nDuring OIDC registration, the user's email was improperly validated against
  the allowed `CODER_OIDC_EMAIL_DOMAIN`s. This could allow a user with a domain that
  only partially matched an allowed domain to successfully login or register (e.g.
  `user@exploitcorp.com` would match the allowed domain `corp.com`).\n\nAn attacker
  could register a domain name that exploited this vulnerability and register on a
  Coder instance with a public OIDC provider.\n\n### Impact\nCoder instances with
  OIDC enabled and protected by the `CODER_OIDC_EMAIL_DOMAIN` configuration.\n\nCoder
  instances using a private OIDC provider are not affected, as arbitrary users cannot
  register through a private OIDC provider without first having an account on the
  provider.\n\nPublic OIDC providers (such as `google.com` without permitted domains
  set on the OAuth2 App) are impacted.\n\nGitHub authentication and external authentication
  are not impacted.\n\n### Was my deployment impacted?\nTo check if your deployment
  was exploited:\n- View the audit log on your deployment for unexpected registered
  users (using the `action:register` filter)\n- Check the users list for unexpected
  users\n    - Users created via this exploit will have a domain that ends with one
  of the allowed domains but doesnâ€™t fully match (e.g. `@exploitcorp.com` instead
  of `@corp.com`)\n\n### Patched Versions\nThis vulnerability is remedied in\n- v2.8.4\n-
  v2.7.3\n- v2.6.1\n\nAll versions prior to these patches are affected by the vulnerability.
  **It is recommended that customers upgrade their deployments as soon as possible
  if they are utilizing OIDC authentication with the `CODER_OIDC_EMAIL_DOMAIN` setting.**"
