package_slug: "go/github.com/Yubico/yubihsm-connector"
title: "Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')"
description: "An issue was discovered in the /api/connector endpoint handler in Yubico
  yubihsm-connector before 3.0.1 (in YubiHSM SDK before 2021.04). The handler does
  not validate the length of the request, which can lead to a state where yubihsm-connector
  becomes stuck in a loop waiting for the YubiHSM to send it data, preventing any
  further operations until the yubihsm-connector is restarted. An attacker can send
  0, 1, or 2 bytes to trigger this."
