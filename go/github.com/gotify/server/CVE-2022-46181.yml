title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "Gotify server is a simple server for sending and receiving messages
  in real-time per WebSocket. Versions prior to 2.2.2 contain an XSS vulnerability
  that allows authenticated users to upload .html files. An attacker could execute
  client side scripts **if** another user opened a link. The attacker could potentially
  take over the account of the user that clicked the link. The Gotify UI won't natively
  expose such a malicious link, so an attacker has to get the user to open the malicious
  link in a context outside of Gotify. The vulnerability has been fixed in version
  2.2.2. As a workaround, you can block access to non image files via a reverse proxy
  in the `./image` directory."
