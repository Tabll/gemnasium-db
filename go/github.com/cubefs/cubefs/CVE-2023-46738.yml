title: "Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling"
description: "CubeFS is an open-source cloud-native file storage system. A security
  vulnerability was found in CubeFS HandlerNode in versions prior to 3.3.1 that could
  allow authenticated users to send maliciously-crafted requests that would crash
  the ObjectNode and deny other users from using it. The root cause was improper handling
  of incoming HTTP requests that could allow an attacker to control the ammount of
  memory that the ObjectNode would allocate. A malicious request could make the ObjectNode
  allocate more memory that the machine had available, and the attacker could exhaust
  memory by way of a single malicious request. An attacker would need to be authenticated
  in order to invoke the vulnerable code with their malicious request and have permissions
  to delete objects. In addition, the attacker would need to know the names of existing
  buckets of the CubeFS deployment - otherwise the request would be rejected before
  it reached the vulnerable code. As such, the most likely attacker is an inside user
  or an attacker that has breached the account of an existing user in the cluster.
  The issue has been patched in v3.3.1. There is no other mitigation besides upgrading."
