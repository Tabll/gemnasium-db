title: "Use of Insufficiently Random Values"
description: "CubeFS is an open-source cloud-native file storage system. Prior to
  version 3.3.1, CubeFS used an insecure random string generator to generate user-specific,
  sensitive keys used to authenticate users in a CubeFS deployment. This could allow
  an attacker to predict and/or guess the generated string and impersonate a user
  thereby obtaining higher privileges. When CubeFS creates new users, it creates a
  piece of sensitive information for the user called the “accessKey”. To create the
  \"accesKey\", CubeFS uses an insecure string generator which makes it easy to guess
  and thereby impersonate the created user. An attacker could leverage the predictable
  random string generator and guess a users access key and impersonate the user to
  obtain higher privileges. The issue has been fixed in v3.3.1. There is no other
  mitigation than to upgrade."
