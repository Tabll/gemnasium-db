title: "Insecure random string generator used for sensitive data"
description: "CubeFS used an insecure random string generator to generate user-specific,
  sensitive keys used to authenticate users in a CubeFS deployment. This could allow
  an attacker to predict and/or guess the generated string and impersonate a user
  thereby obtaining higher privileges.\n\nWhen CubeFS creates new users, it creates
  a piece of sensitive information for the user called the “accessKey”. To create
  the \"accesKey\", CubeFS uses an insecure string generator which makes it easy to
  guess and thereby impersonate the created user.\n\nAn attacker could leverage the
  predictable random string generator and guess a users access key and impersonate
  the user to obtain higher privileges.\n\nThere is no evidence of this vulnerability
  being exploited in the wild. It was found during a security audit carried out by
  [Ada Logics](https://adalogics.com/) in collaboration with [OSTIF](https://ostif.org/)
  and the [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/).\n\nThe issue has been fixed in v3.3.1. There
  is no other mitigation than to upgrade."
