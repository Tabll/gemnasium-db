package_slug: "go/github.com/px-org/PanIndex"
title: "Use of Hard-coded Credentials"
description: "PanIndex is a network disk directory index. In Panindex prior to version
  3.1.3, a hard-coded JWT key `PanIndex` is used. An attacker can use the hard-coded
  JWT key to sign JWT token and perform any actions as a user with admin privileges.
  Version 3.1.3 has a patch for the issue. As a workaround, one may change the JWT
  key in the source code before compiling the project."
