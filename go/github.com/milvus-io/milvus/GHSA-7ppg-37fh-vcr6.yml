title: "Milvus: Unauthenticated Access to Restful API on Metrics Port (9091) Leads
  to Critical System Compromise"
description: "Milvus exposes TCP port 9091 by default with two critical authentication
  bypass vulnerabilities:\n\n1. The `/expr` debug endpoint uses a weak, predictable
  default authentication token derived from `etcd.rootPath` (default: `by-dev`), enabling
  arbitrary expression evaluation.\n2. The full REST API (`/api/v1/*`) is registered
  on the metrics/management port without any authentication, allowing unauthenticated
  access to all business operations including data manipulation and credential management."
