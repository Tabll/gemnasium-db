package_slug: "go/github.com/argoproj/argo-events"
title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "Argo Events is an event-driven workflow automation framework for Kubernetes.
  Prior to version 1.7.1, several `HandleRoute` endpoints make use of the deprecated
  `ioutil.ReadAll()`. `ioutil.ReadAll()` reads all the data into memory. As such,
  an attacker who sends a large request to the Argo Events server will be able to
  crash it and cause denial of service. A patch for this vulnerability has been released
  in Argo Events version 1.7.1."
