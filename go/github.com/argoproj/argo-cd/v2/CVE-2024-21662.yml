title: "Bypassing Rate Limit and Brute Force Protection Using Cache Overflow"
description: "An attacker can effectively bypass the rate limit and brute force protections
  by exploiting the application's weak cache-based mechanism. This loophole in security
  can be combined with other vulnerabilities to attack the default admin account.
  This flaw undermines a previously [patched CVE](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/security_considerations/#cve-2020-8827-insufficient-anti-automationanti-brute-force)
  intended to protect against brute-force attacks."
