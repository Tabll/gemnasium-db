title: "Argo CD does not scrub secret values from patch errors"
description: "A vulnerability was discovered in Argo CD that exposed secret values
  in error messages and the diff view when an invalid Kubernetes Secret resource was
  synced from a repository.\n\nThe vulnerability assumes the user has write access
  to the repository and can exploit it, either intentionally or unintentionally, by
  committing an invalid Secret to repository and triggering a Sync. Once exploited,
  any user with read access to Argo CD can view the exposed secret data."
