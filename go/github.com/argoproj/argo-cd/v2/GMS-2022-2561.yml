title: "Symlink following allows leaking out-of-bounds YAML files from Argo CD repo-server"
description: "### Impact\n\nAll unpatched versions of Argo CD starting with v1.3.0
  is vulnerable to a symlink following bug allowing a malicious user with repository
  write access to leak sensitive YAML files from Argo CD's repo-server.\n\nA malicious
  Argo CD user with write access for a repository which is (or may be) used in a Helm-type
  Application may commit a symlink which points to an out-of-bounds file. If the target
  file is a valid YAML file, the attacker can read the contents of that file.\n\nSensitive
  files which could be leaked include manifest files from other Applications' source
  repositories (potentially decrypted files, if you are using a decryption plugin)
  or any YAML-formatted secrets which have been mounted as files on the repo-server.\n\n###
  Patches\n\nA patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo
  CD versions:\n\n* v2.4.1\n* v2.3.5\n* v2.2.10\n* v2.1.16\n\n### Workarounds\n\n*
  If you are using >=v2.3.0 and do not have any Helm-type Applications, [disable the
  Helm config management tool](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/tool_detection/#disable-built-in-tools).\n\n####
  Mitigations\n\n* Avoid mounting YAML-formatted secrets as files on the repo-server.\n*
  Upgrade to >=2.3.0 to significantly reduce the risk of leaking out-of-bounds manifest
  files. Starting with 2.3.0, repository paths are randomized, and read permissions
  are restricted when manifests are not being actively being generated. This makes
  it very difficult to craft and use a malicious symlink.\n\n#### Best practices which
  can mitigate risk\n\n* Limit who has push access to manifest repositories.\n* Limit
  who is allowed to configure new source repositories.\n\n### Credits\n\nDisclosed
  by ADA Logics in a security audit of the Argo project sponsored by CNCF and facilitated
  by OSTIF. Thanks to Adam Korczynski and David Korczynski for their work on the audit.\n\n###
