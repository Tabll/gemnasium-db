package_slug: "go/github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v2"
title: "UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following"
description: "Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.
  Argo CD starting with version 0.7.0 and prior to versions 2.1.15m 2.2.9, and 2.3.4
  is vulnerable to a symlink following bug allowing a malicious user with repository
  write access to leak sensitive files from Argo CD's repo-server. A malicious Argo
  CD user with write access for a repository which is (or may be) used in a directory-type
  Application may commit a symlink which points to an out-of-bounds file. Sensitive
  files which could be leaked include manifest files from other Applications' source
  repositories (potentially decrypted files, if you are using a decryption plugin)
  or any JSON-formatted secrets which have been mounted as files on the repo-server.
  A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions 2.3.4, 2.2.9,
  and 2.1.15. Users of versions 2.3.0 or above who do not have any Jsonnet/directory-type
  Applications may disable the Jsonnet/directory config management tool as a workaround."
