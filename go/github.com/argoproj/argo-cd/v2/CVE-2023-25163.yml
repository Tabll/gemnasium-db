title: "Argo CD leaks repository credentials in user-facing error messages and in
  logs"
description: "All versions of Argo CD starting with v2.6.0-rc1 have an output sanitization
  bug which leaks repository access credentials in error messages. These error messages
  are visible to the user, and they are logged. The error message is visible when
  a user attempts to create or update an Application via the Argo CD API (and therefor
  the UI or CLI). The user must have `applications, create` or `applications, update`
  RBAC access to reach the code which may produce the error.\n\nThe user is not guaranteed
  to be able to trigger the error message. They may attempt to spam the API with requests
  to trigger a rate limit error from the upstream repository.\n\nIf the user has `repositories,
  update` access, they may edit an existing repository to introduce a URL typo or
  otherwise force an error message. But if they have that level of access, they are
  probably intended to have access to the credentials anyway."
