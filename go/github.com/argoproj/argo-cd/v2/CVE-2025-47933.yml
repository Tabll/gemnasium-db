description: "This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform arbitrary actions on
  behalf of the victim via the API, such as creating, modifying, and deleting Kubernetes
  resources. Due to the improper filtering of URL protocols in the repository page,
  an attacker can achieve cross-site scripting with permission to edit the repository.\n\nIn

  URL."
