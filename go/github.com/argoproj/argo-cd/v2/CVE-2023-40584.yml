title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "Argo CD is a declarative continuous deployment for Kubernetes. All versions
  of ArgoCD starting from v2.4 have a bug where the ArgoCD repo-server component is
  vulnerable to a Denial-of-Service attack vector. Specifically, the said component
  extracts a user-controlled tar.gz file without validating the size of its inner
  files. As a result, a malicious, low-privileged user can send a malicious tar.gz
  file that exploits this vulnerability to the repo-server, thereby harming the system's
  functionality and availability. Additionally, the repo-server is susceptible to
  another vulnerability due to the fact that it does not check the extracted file
  permissions before attempting to delete them. Consequently, an attacker can craft
  a malicious tar.gz archive in a way that prevents the deletion of its inner files
  when the manifest generation process is completed. A patch for this vulnerability
  has been released in versions 2.6.15, 2.7.14, and 2.8.3. Users are advised to upgrade.
  The only way to completely resolve the issue is to upgrade, however users unable
  to upgrade should configure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) and provide access
  for configuring applications only to a limited number of administrators. These administrators
  should utilize trusted and verified Helm charts."
