title: "ArgoCD's repo server has Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability"
description: "All versions of ArgoCD starting from v2.4 have a bug where the ArgoCD
  repo-server component is vulnerable to a Denial-of-Service attack vector. Specifically,
  \ it's possible to crash the repo server component through an out of memory error
  by pointing it to a malicious Helm registry.\nThe loadRepoIndex() function in the
  ArgoCD's helm package, does not limit the size nor time while fetching the data.
  It fetches it and creates a byte slice from the retrieved data in one go. If the
  registry is implemented to push data continuously, the repo server will keep allocating
  memory until it runs out of it."
