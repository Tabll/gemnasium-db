title: "Unauthenticated argocd-server panic via a malicious Bitbucket-Server webhook
  payload"
description: "Unpatched Argo CD versions are vulnerable to malicious API requests
  which can crash the API server and cause denial of service to legitimate clients.\n\nWith
  the default configuration, no `webhook.bitbucketserver.secret` set, Argo CDâ€™s /api/webhook
  endpoint will crash the entire argocd-server process when it receives a Bitbucket-Server
  push event whose JSON field `repository.links.clone` is anything other than an array.\n\nA
  single unauthenticated curl request can push the control-plane into CrashLoopBackOff;
  repeating the request on each replica causes a complete outage of the API."
