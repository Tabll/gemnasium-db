package_slug: "go/github.com/argoproj/argo-cd"
title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.
  All unpatched versions of Argo CD starting with 1.0.0 is vulnerable to an improper
  access control bug, allowing a malicious user to potentially escalate their privileges
  to admin-level. Versions starting with 0.8.0 and 0.5.0 contain limited versions
  of this issue. To perform exploits, an authorized Argo CD user must have push access
  to an Application's source git or Helm repository or `sync` and `override` access
  to an Application. Once a user has that access, different exploitation levels are
  possible depending on their other RBAC privileges. A patch for this vulnerability
  has been released in Argo CD versions 2.3.2, 2.2.8, and 2.1.14. Some mitigation
  measures are available but do not serve as a substitute for upgrading. To avoid
  privilege escalation, limit who has push access to Application source repositories
  or `sync` + `override` access to Applications; and limit which repositories are
  available in projects where users have `update` access to Applications. To avoid
  unauthorized resource inspection/tampering, limit who has `delete`, `get`, or `action`
  access to Applications."
