title: "Users with `create` but not `override` privileges can perform local sync"
description: "\"Local sync\" is an Argo CD feature that allows developers to temporarily
  override an Application's manifests with locally-defined manifests. Use of the feature
  should generally be limited to highly-trusted users, since it allows the user to
  bypass any merge protections in git.\n\nAn improper validation bug allows users
  who have `create` privileges but not `override` privileges to sync local manifests
  on app creation. All other restrictions, including AppProject restrictions are still
  enforced. The only restriction which is _not_ enforced is that the manifests come
  from some approved git/Helm/OCI source.\n\nThe bug was introduced in 1.2.0-rc1 when
  the local manifest sync feature was added."
