title: "Users with `create` but not `override` privileges can perform local sync"
description: "### Impact\n\n\"Local sync\" is an Argo CD feature that allows developers
  to temporarily override an Application's manifests with locally-defined manifests.
  Use of the feature should generally be limited to highly-trusted users, since it
  allows the user to bypass any merge protections in git.\n\nAn improper validation
  bug allows users who have `create` privileges but not `override` privileges to sync
  local manifests on app creation. All other restrictions, including AppProject restrictions
  are still enforced. The only restriction which is _not_ enforced is that the manifests
  come from some approved git/Helm/OCI source.\n\nThe bug was introduced in 1.2.0-rc1
  when the local manifest sync feature was added.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe bug has been
  patched in the following versions:\n\n* 2.10.3\n* 2.9.8\n* 2.8.12\n\n### Workarounds\n\nTo
  immediately mitigate the risk of branch protection bypass, remove `applications,
  create` RBAC access. The only way to eliminate the issue without removing RBAC access
  is to upgrade to a patched version.\n\nBranch protection rules and review requirements
  are a great way to enforce security constraints in a GitOps environment, but they
  should be just one layer in a multi-layered approach. Make sure your AppProject
  and RBAC restrictions are as thorough as possible to prevent a review bypass vulnerability
  from permitting excessive damage.\n\n### References\n\n* [Argo CD RBAC documentation](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operator-manual/rbac/)\n\n###
