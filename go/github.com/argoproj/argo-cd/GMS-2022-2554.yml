package_slug: "go/github.com/argoproj/argo-cd"
title: "Insecure entropy in Argo CD's PKCE/Oauth2/OIDC params"
description: "### Impact\n\nAll versions of Argo CD starting with v0.11.0 is vulnerable
  to a variety of attacks when an SSO login is initiated from the Argo CD CLI or UI.
  The vulnerabilities are due to the use of insufficiently random values in parameters
  in Oauth2/OIDC login flows. In each case, using a relatively-predictable (time-based)
  seed in a non-cryptographically-secure pseudo-random number generator made the parameter
  less random than required by the relevant spec or by general best practices."
