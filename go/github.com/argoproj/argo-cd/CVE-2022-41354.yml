title: "Argo CD authenticated but unauthorized users may enumerate Application names
  via the API"
description: "### Impact\n\nAll versions of Argo CD starting with v0.5.0 is vulnerable
  to an information disclosure bug allowing unauthorized users to enumerate application
  names by inspecting API error messages. An attacker could use the discovered application
  names as the starting point of another attack. For example, the attacker might use
  their knowledge of an application name to convince an administrator to grant higher
  privileges (social engineering).\n\nMany Argo CD API endpoints accept an application
  name as the only parameter. Since Argo CD RBAC requires both the application name
  and its configured project name (and, if apps-in-any-namespace is enabled, the application's
  namespace), Argo CD fetches the requested application before performing the RBAC
  check. If the application does not exist, the API returns a \"not found\". If the
  application does exist, and the user does not have access, the API returns an \"unauthorized\"
  error. By trial and error, an attacker can infer which applications exist and which
  do not.\n\nNote that application resources are not fetched for API calls from _unauthenticated_
  users. If your Argo CD instance is accessible from the public internet, unauthenticated
  users will not be able to cause Argo CD to make Kubernetes API calls.\n\nThe patch
  changes API behavior to return \"unauthorized\" both when the application is missing
  and when the user is not authorized to access it. **This change in API behavior
  may impact API clients.** Check your code to make sure it will handle the new API
  behavior properly.\n\n### Patches\n\nA patch for this vulnerability has been released
  in the following Argo CD versions:\n\n* v2.6.7\n* v2.5.16\n* v2.4.28\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere
  are no workarounds besides upgrading.\n\n### Credits\n\nThank you to bean.zhang
  of HIT-IDS ChunkL Team who discovered the issue and reported it confidentially according
  to our [guidelines](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/SECURITY.md#reporting-a-vulnerability).\n\n###
