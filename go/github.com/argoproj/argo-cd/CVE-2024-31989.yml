title: "ArgoCD Vulnerable to Use of Risky or Missing Cryptographic Algorithms in Redis
  Cache"
description: "By default, the Redis database server is not password-protected. Consequently,
  an attacker with access to the Redis server can gain read/write access to the data
  in Redis. The attacker can also modify the \"mfst\" (manifest) key to cause ArgoCD
  to execute any deployment, potentially leveraging ArgoCD's high privileges to take
  over the cluster. Updating the \"cacheEntryHash\" in the manifest JSON is necessary,
  but since it doesn't use a private key for signing its integrity, a simple script
  can generate a new FNV64a hash matching the new manifest values. The repo-server,
  unable to verify if its cache is compromised, will read the altered \"mfst\" key
  and initiate an update process for the injected deployment.\n\nIt's also possible
  to edit the \"app|resources-tree\" key, causing the ArgoCD server to load any Kubernetes
  resource into the live manifest section of the app preview. This could lead to an
  information leak.\n\nThe fact that the cache in Redis is neither signed nor validated,
  combined with Redis's default lack of password protection, presents a significant
  security concern given ArgoCD's high-level permissions within the cluster. A security
  update should ensure all Redis database values are signed or encrypted."
