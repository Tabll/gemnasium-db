title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.
  Argo CD starting with 2.3.0 and prior to 2.3.6 and 2.4.5 is vulnerable to a cross-site
  scripting (XSS) bug which could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript
  in the `/auth/callback` page in a victim's browser. This vulnerability only affects
  Argo CD instances which have single sign on (SSO) enabled. The exploit also assumes
  the attacker has 1) access to the API server's encryption key, 2) a method to add
  a cookie to the victim's browser, and 3) the ability to convince the victim to visit
  a malicious `/auth/callback` link. The vulnerability is classified as low severity
  because access to the API server's encryption key already grants a high level of
  access. Exploiting the XSS would allow the attacker to impersonate the victim, but
  would not grant any privileges which the attacker could not otherwise gain using
  the encryption key. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following
  Argo CD versions 2.4.5 and 2.3.6. There is currently no known workaround."
