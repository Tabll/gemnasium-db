package_slug: "go/github.com/argoproj/argo-cd"
title: "Users with any cluster secret update access may update out-of-bounds cluster
  secrets"
description: "Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.
  All Argo CD versions starting with 2.3.0-rc1 and prior to 2.3.17, 2.4.23 2.5.11,
  and 2.6.2 is vulnerable to an improper authorization bug which allows users who
  have the ability to update at least one cluster secret to update any cluster secret.
  The attacker could use this access to escalate privileges (potentially controlling
  Kubernetes resources) or to break Argo CD functionality (by preventing connections
  to external clusters). A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo
  CD versions 2.6.2, 2.5.11, 2.4.23, and 2.3.17. Two workarounds are available. Either
  modify the RBAC configuration to completely revoke all `clusters, update` access,
  or use the `destinations` and `clusterResourceallow list` fields to apply similar
  restrictions as the `namespaces` and `clusterResources` fields."
