title: "Helm OCI credentials leaked into Argo CD logs"
description: "### Impact\n\nWhen Argo CD was connected to a Helm OCI repository with
  authentication enabled, the credentials used for accessing the remote repository
  were logged.\n\nAnyone with access to the pod logs - either via access with appropriate
  permissions to the Kubernetes control plane or a third party log management system
  where the logs from Argo CD were aggregated - could have potentially obtained the
  credentials to the Helm OCI repository.\n\nIf you are using Helm OCI repositories
  with Argo CD, it is strongly recommended to upgrade Argo CD to the latest patch
  version and to change the credentials used to access the repositories.\n\n### Patches\n\nA
  patch for this vulnerability is available with the v1.8.7 and v1.7.14 releases of
  Argo CD.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNo workaround available\n\n### References\n\nN/A\n\n###
