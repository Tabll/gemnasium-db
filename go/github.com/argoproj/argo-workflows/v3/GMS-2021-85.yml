title: "Potential privilege escalation on Kubernetes >= v1.19 when the Argo Sever
  is run with `--auth-mode=client`"
description: "### Impact\n\nThis is pro-active fix. No know exploits exist. \n\nImpacted:\n\n*
  You're running Kubernetes >= v1.19\n* You're running Argo Server\n* It is configured
  to with `--auth-mode=client`\n* Is not configured with `--auth-mode=server`\n* You
  are not running Argo Server in Kubernetes pod. E.g. on bare metal or other VM.\n*
  You're using client key to authenticate on the server. \n* The server has more permissions
  that the connecting client's account.\n\nThe client's authentication will be ignored
  and the server's authentication will be used. This will result in privilege escalation
  to that of the the server's account.\n\n### Patches\n\nhttps://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/pull/6506\n\n###
  Workarounds\n\nNone."
