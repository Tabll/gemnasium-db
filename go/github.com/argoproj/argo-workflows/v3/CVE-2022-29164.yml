title: "Malicious HTML+XHR Artifact Privilege Escalation in Argo Workflows"
description: "Argo Workflows is an open source container-native workflow engine for
  orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes. In affected versions an attacker can
  create a workflow which produces a HTML artifact containing an HTML file that contains
  a script which uses XHR calls to interact with the Argo Server API. The attacker
  emails the deep-link to the artifact to their victim. The victim opens the link,
  the script starts running. As the script has access to the Argo Server API (as the
  victim), so may read information about the victim’s workflows, or create and delete
  workflows. Note the attacker must be an insider: they must have access to the same
  cluster as the victim and must already be able to run their own workflows. The attacker
  must have an understanding of the victim’s system. We have seen no evidence of this
  in the wild. We urge all users to upgrade to the fixed versions."
