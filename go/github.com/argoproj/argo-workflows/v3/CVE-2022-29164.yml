title: "Malicious HTML+XHR Artifact Privilege Escalation in Argo Workflows"
description: "Argo Workflows is an open source container-native workflow engine for
  orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes.\n\n* The attacker creates a workflow
  that produces a HTML artifact that contains a HTML file that contains a script which
  uses XHR calls to interact with the Argo Server API.\n* The attacker emails the
  deep-link to the artifact to their victim. The victim opens the link, the script
  starts running.\n\nAs the script has access to the Argo Server API (as the victim),
  so may do the following (if the victim may):\n\n* Read information about the victim’s
  workflows.\n* Create or delete workflows.\n\nNotes:\n\n* The attacker must be an
  insider: they must have access to the same cluster as the victim and must already
  be able to run their own workflows.\n* The attacker must have an understanding of
  the victim’s system. They won’t be able to repeatedly probe due to the social engineering
  \ aspect.\n* The attacker is likely leave an audit trail.\n\nWe have seen no evidence
  of this in the wild. While the impact is high, it is very hard to exploit.\n\nWe
  urge all users to upgrade to the fixed versions. Disabling the Argo Server is the
  only known workaround. Note version 2.12 has been out of support for sometime. No
  fix is currently planned."
