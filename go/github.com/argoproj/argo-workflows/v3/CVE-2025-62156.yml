title: "Argo Workflow has a Zipslip Vulnerability"
description: |
  Argo Workflows is an open source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes. 
  Versions prior to 3.6.12 and versions 3.7.0 through 3.7.2 contain a Zip Slip path traversal vulnerability in artifact extraction. 
  During artifact extraction the unpack/untar logic (workflow/executor/executor.go) uses filepath.Join(dest, filepath.Clean(header.Name)) 
  without validating that header.Name stays within the intended extraction directory. A malicious archive entry can supply a traversal or 
  absolute path that, after cleaning, overrides the destination directory and causes files to be written outside the /work/tmp extraction 
  path and into system directories such as /etc inside the container. The vulnerability enables arbitrary file creation or overwrite in 
  system configuration locations (for example /etc/passwd, /etc/hosts, /etc/crontab), which can lead to privilege escalation or persistence 
  within the affected container. Update to 3.6.12 or 3.7.3 to remediate the issue.
