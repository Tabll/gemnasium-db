package_slug: "go/github.com/argoproj/argo"
title: "Insecure Default Initialization of Resource"
description: "As of v1.5.0, the default admin password is set to the argocd-server
  pod name. For insiders with access to the cluster or logs, this issue could be abused
  for privilege escalation, as Argo has privileged roles. A malicious insider is the
  most realistic threat, but pod names are not meant to be kept secret and could wind
  up just about anywhere."
