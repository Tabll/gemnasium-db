package_slug: "go/github.com/ory/fosite/handler/oauth2"
title: "Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions"
description: "In ORY Fosite (the security first OAuth2 & OpenID Connect framework
  for Go) before version 0.34.0, the `TokenRevocationHandler` ignores errors coming
  from the storage. This can lead to unexpected 200 status codes indicating successful
  revocation while the token is still valid. Whether an attacker can use this for
  her advantage depends on the ability to trigger errors in the store. This is fixed
  in version 0.34.0"
