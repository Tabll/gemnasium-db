title: "Possible bypass of token claim validation when OAuth2 Introspection caching
  is enabled"
description: "When you make a request to an endpoint that requires the
  scope `foo` using an access token granted with that `foo` scope, introspection will
  be valid and that token will be cached. The problem comes when a second requests
  to an endpoint that requires the scope `bar` is made before the cache has expired.
  Whether the token is granted or not to the `bar` scope, introspection will be valid.\n\n###
  Patches\n\nA patch will be released with `v0.38.12-beta.1`."
