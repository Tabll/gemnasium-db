package_slug: "go/github.com/ory/oathkeeper"
title: "Incorrect Authorization"
description: "ORY Oathkeeper is an Identity & Access Proxy (IAP) and Access Control
  Decision API that authorizes HTTP requests based on sets of Access Rules. When you
  make a request to an endpoint that requires the scope `foo` using an access token
  granted with that `foo` scope, introspection will be valid and that token will be
  cached. The problem comes when a second requests to an endpoint that requires the
  scope `bar` is made before the cache has expired. Whether the token is granted or
  not to the `bar` scope, introspection will be valid. A patch will be released with
  `v0.38.12-beta.1`. Per default, caching is disabled for the `oauth2_introspection`
  authenticator. When caching is disabled, this vulnerability does not exist. The
  cache is checked in `func (a *AuthenticatorOAuth2Introspection) Authenticate(...)`
  From `tokenFromCache()` it seems that it only validates the token expiration date, 
  but ignores whether the
  token has or not the proper scopes. The vulnerability was introduced in PR #424.
  During review, we failed to require appropriate test coverage by the submitter which
  is the primary reason that the vulnerability passed the review process."
