title: "tss-lib leaks secret keys in response to incorrectly constructed Paillier
  moduli"
description: "### Impact\n\nThe specification of the GG18 threshold ECDSA signature
  protocol contains a vulnerability allowing an attacker to recover the shared secret
  key. If a participant generates a Paillier modulus `N` containing small factors
  (less than `2^100`) they can interact with other participants in the signing protocol
  to steal their secret key shares in as little as sixteen signing attempts. The master
  key can then be reconstructed from these shares.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe implementation
  of GG18 in tss-lib does not prove that `N` is biprime or that it does not contain
  small factors. The fixed implementation adds the following proofs from the CGGMP21
  threshold ECDSA protocol to the key generation:\n\n- Paillier-Blum Modulus (`N`
  is the product of two primes)\n- No Small Factor (both factors of `N` are greater
  than `2^256`)\n\nThese proofs apply to both the Paillier encryption modulus `N`,
  and the modulus `NTilde` used in MTA proofs.\n\nTo address the issue in the resharing
  protocol, an additional round has been added to the end so that participants can
  confirm that they received valid proofs.\n\n### References\n\n- [GG18](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/114)\n-
