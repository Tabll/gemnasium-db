package_slug: "go/github.com/go-jose/go-jose/v4"
title: "DoS in go-jose Parsing"
description: "When parsing compact JWS or JWE input, go-jose could use excessive memory.
  The code used strings.Split(token, \".\") to split JWT tokens, which is vulnerable
  to excessive memory consumption when processing maliciously crafted tokens with
  a large number of '.' characters.  An attacker could exploit this by sending numerous
  malformed tokens, leading to memory exhaustion and a Denial of Service."
