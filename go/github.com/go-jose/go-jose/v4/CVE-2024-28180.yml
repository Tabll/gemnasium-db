title: "Go JOSE vulnerable to Improper Handling of Highly Compressed Data (Data Amplification)"
description: "### Impact\nAn attacker could send a JWE containing compressed data
  that used large amounts of memory and CPU when decompressed by Decrypt or DecryptMulti.
  Those functions now return an error if the decompressed data would exceed 250kB
  or 10x the compressed size (whichever is larger). Thanks to Enze Wang@Alioth and
  Jianjun Chen@Zhongguancun Lab (@zer0yu and @chenjj) for reporting.\n\n### Patches\nThe
  problem is fixed in v4.0.1, v3.0.3, v2.6.3\n\n"
