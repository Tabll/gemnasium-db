title: "Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources"
description: "SpiceDB is an open source, Google Zanzibar-inspired, database system
  for creating and managing security-critical application permissions. Any user making
  a negative authorization decision based on the results of a `LookupResources` request
  with 1.22.0 is affected. For example, using `LookupResources` to find a list of
  resources to allow access to be okay: some subjects that should have access to a
  resource may not. But if using `LookupResources` to find a list of banned resources
  instead, then some users that shouldn't have access may. Generally, `LookupResources`
  is not and should not be to gate access in this way - that's what the `Check` API
  is for. Additionally, version 1.22.0 has included a warning about this bug since
  its initial release. Users are advised to upgrade to version 1.22.2. Users unable
  to upgrade should avoid using `LookupResources` for negative authorization decisions."
