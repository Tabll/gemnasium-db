title: "Lookup operations do not take into account wildcards in SpiceDB"
description: "SpiceDB is a database system for managing security-critical application
  permissions. Any user making use of a wildcard relationship under the right hand
  branch of an `exclusion` or within an `intersection` operation will see `Lookup`/`LookupResources`
  return a resource as \"accessible\" if it is *not* accessible by virtue of the inclusion
  of the wildcard in the intersection or the right side of the exclusion. In `v1.3.0`,
  the wildcard is ignored entirely in lookup's dispatch, resulting in the `banned`
  wildcard being ignored in the exclusion. contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround,
  don't make use of wildcards on the right side of intersections or within exclusions."
