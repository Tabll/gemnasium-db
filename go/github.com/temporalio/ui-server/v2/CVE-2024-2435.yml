package_slug: "go/github.com/temporalio/ui-server/v2"
title: "Temporal UI Server cross-site scripting vulnerability"
description: "For an attacker with pre-existing access to send a signal to a workflow,
  the attacker can make the signal name a script that executes when a victim views
  that signal. The XSS is in the timeline page displaying the workflow execution details
  of the workflow that was sent the crafted signal.\nAccess to send a signal to a
  workflow is determined by how you configured the authorizer on your server. This
  includes any entity with permission to directly call SignalWorkflowExecution or
  SignalWithStartWorkflowExecution, or any entity can deploy a worker that has access
  to call workflow progress APIs (specifically RespondWorkflowTaskCompleted)."
