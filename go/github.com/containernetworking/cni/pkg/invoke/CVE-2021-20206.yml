package_slug: "go/github.com/containernetworking/cni/pkg/invoke"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "An improper limitation of path name flaw was found in containernetworking/cni
  in versions before 0.8.1. When specifying the plugin to load in the 'type' field
  in the network configuration, it is possible to use special elements such as \"../\"
  separators to reference binaries elsewhere on the system. This flaw allows an attacker
  to execute other existing binaries other than the cni plugins/types, such as 'reboot'.
  The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as
  well as system availability."
