title: "NULL Pointer Dereference"
description: "quic-go is an implementation of the QUIC protocol in Go. Starting in
  version 0.37.0 and prior to version 0.37.3, by serializing an ACK frame after the
  CRYTPO that allows a node to complete the handshake, a remote node could trigger
  a nil pointer dereference (leading to a panic) when the node attempted to drop the
  Handshake packet number space. An attacker can bring down a quic-go node with very
  minimal effort. Completing the QUIC handshake only requires sending and receiving
  a few packets. Version 0.37.3 contains a patch. Versions before 0.37.0 are not affected."
