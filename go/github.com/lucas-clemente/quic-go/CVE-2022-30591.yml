title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "quic-go through 0.27.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
  service (CPU consumption) via a Slowloris variant in which incomplete QUIC or HTTP/3
  requests are sent. This occurs because mtu_discoverer.go misparses the MTU Discovery
  service and consequently overflows the probe timer. NOTE: the vendor's position
  is that this behavior should not be listed as a vulnerability on the CVE List"
