title: "VictoriaMetrics' Snappy Decoder DoS Vulnerability is Causing OOM"
description: "Affected versions are vulnerable to DoS attacks because the snappy decoder
  ignored VictoriaMetrics request size limits allowing malformed blocks to trigger
  excessive memory use. This could lead to OOM errors and service instability. The
  fix enforces block-size checks based on MaxRequest limits."
