title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command
  Injection')"
description: "gh-ost is a triggerless online schema migration solution for MySQL.
  It is subject to an arbitrary file read vulnerability. The attacker must have access
  to the target host or trick an administrator into executing a malicious gh-ost command
  on a host running gh-ost, plus network access from host running gh-ost to the attack's
  malicious MySQL server. The `-database` parameter does not properly sanitize user
  input which can lead to arbitrary file reads."
