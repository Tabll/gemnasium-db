package_slug: "go/github.com/stripe/smokescreen"
title: "Smokescreen SSRF via deny list bypass"
description: "The primary use case for Smokescreen is to prevent server-side request
  forgery (SSRF) attacks in which external attackers leverage the behavior of applications
  to connect to or scan internal infrastructure.\n\nSmokescreen also offers an option
  to deny access to additional (e.g., external) URLs by way of a deny list. There
  was an issue in Smokescreen that made it possible to bypass the deny list feature
  by appending a dot to the end of user-supplied URLs, or by providing input in a
  different letter case.\n\n### Recommendation\nUpgrade Smokescreen to version 0.0.3
  or later.\n\n### Acknowledgements\nThanks to [Grzegorz Niedziela](https://twitter.com/gregxsunday)
  for reporting the issue.\n\n### For more information\nEmail us at security@stripe.com"
