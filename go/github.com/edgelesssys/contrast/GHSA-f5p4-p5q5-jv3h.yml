title: "Contrast has insecure LUKS2 persistent storage partitions may be opened and
  used"
description: "A malicious host may provide a crafted LUKS2 volume to a Contrast pod
  VM that uses the [secure persistent volume](https://docs.edgeless.systems/contrast/howto/encrypted-storage)
  feature. The guest will open the volume and write secret data using a volume key
  known to the attacker.\n\nLUKS2 volume metadata is (a) not authenticated and (b)
  supports null key-encryption algorithms, allowing an attacker to create a volume
  such that the volume:\n\n- Opens (cryptsetup open) without error using any passphrase
  or token\n- Records all writes in plaintext (or ciphertext with an attacker-known
  key)"
