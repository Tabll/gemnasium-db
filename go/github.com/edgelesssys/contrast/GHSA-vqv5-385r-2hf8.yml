title: "Contrast's unauthenticated recovery allows Coordinator impersonation"
description: "Recovering coordinators do not verify the seed provided by the recovering
  party. This allows an attacker to set up a coordinator with a manifest that passes
  validation, but with a secret seed controlled by the attacker.\n\nIf network traffic
  is redirected from the legitimate coordinator to the attacker's coordinator, a workload
  owner is susceptible to impersonation if either\n\n* they `set` a new manifest and
  don't compare the root CA cert with the existing one (this is the default of the
  `contrast` CLI) or\n* they `verify` the coordinator and don't compare the root CA
  cert with a trusted reference.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the attacker can:\n\n*
  Issue certificates that chain back to the attacker coordinator's root CA.\n* Recover
  arbitrary workload secrets of workloads deployed after the attack.\n\nThis issue
  does **not** affect the following:\n\n* secrets of the legitimate coordinator (seed,
  workload secrets, CA)\n* integrity of workloads, even when used with the rogue coordinator\n*
  certificates chaining back to the mesh CA"
