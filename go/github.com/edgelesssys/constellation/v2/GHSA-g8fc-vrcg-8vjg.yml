title: "Constallation has pods exposed to peers in VPC"
description: "Cilium allows outside actors (`world` entity) to directly access pods
  with their internal pod IP, even if they are not exposed explicitly (e.g. via `LoadBalancer`).
  A pod that does not authenticate clients and that does not exclude `world` traffic
  via network policy may leak sensitive data to an attacker _inside the cloud VPC_."
