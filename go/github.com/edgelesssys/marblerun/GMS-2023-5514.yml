title: "Go package github.com/edgelesssys/marblerun CLI commands susceptible to MITM
  attacks"
description: "### Impact\nAny CLI command issued to a Coordinator after the Manifest
  has been set, is susceptible to be redirected to another MarbleRun Coordinator instance,
  which runs the same binary, but potentially a different manifest.\n\n### Patches\n
  The issue has been patched in [`v1.4.0`](https://github.com/edgelesssys/marblerun/releases/tag/v1.4.0)\n\n###
  Workarounds\n\nDirectly using the REST API of the Coordinator and manually verifying
  and pinning the certificate to a set Manifest avoids the issue.\n"
