title: "gnark-crypto doesn't range check input values during ECDSA and EdDSA signature
  deserialization"
description: "During deserialization of ECDSA and EdDSA signatures gnark-crypto did
  not check that the values are in the range `[1, n-1]` with `n` being the corresponding
  modulus (either base field modulus in case of `R` in EdDSA, and scalar field modulus
  in case of `s,r` in ECDSA and `s` in EdDSA). As this also allowed zero inputs, then
  it was possible to craft a signature which lead to null pointer dereference, leading
  to denial-of-service of an application. This also enabled weak signature malleability
  when the users assumed uniqueness of the serialized signatures (but not the underlying
  modulo reduced values).\n\nWe are not aware of any users impacted by the bug. The
  implemented signature schemes in gnark-crypto complement the in-circuit versions
  in gnark, allowing to have end-to-end tests."
