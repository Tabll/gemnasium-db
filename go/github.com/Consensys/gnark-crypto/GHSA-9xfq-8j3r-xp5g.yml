description: "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-fr8m-434r-g3xp. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n## Original Description\nConsensys gnark-crypto through 0.11.2 allows
  Signature Malleability. This occurs because deserialisation of EdDSA and ECDSA signatures
  does not ensure that the data is in a certain interval."
