title: "gnark-crypto's exponentiation in the pairing target group GT using GLV can
  give incorrect results"
description: "### Impact\nWhen the exponent is bigger than `r`, the group order of
  the pairing target group `GT`, the exponentiation Ã  la GLV (`ExpGLV`) can *sometimes*
  give incorrect results compared to normal exponentiation (`Exp`). \n\nThe issue
  impacts all users using `ExpGLV` for exponentiations in `GT`. This does not impact
  `Exp` and `ExpCyclotomic` which are sound. Also note that GLV methods in G1 and
  G2 are sound and _not_ impacted.\n\n### Patches\nFix has been implemented in pull
  request https://github.com/Consensys/gnark-crypto/pull/451 and merged in commit
  https://github.com/Consensys/gnark-crypto/commit/ec6be1a037f7c496d595c541a8a8d31c47bcfa3d
  to master branch.\n\nThe fix increased the bounds of the sub-scalars by 1. In fact,
  since https://github.com/Consensys/gnark-crypto/pull/213, we use a fast scalar decomposition
  that tradeoffs divisions (needed in the Babai rounding) by right-shifts. We precompute
  `b=2^m*v/d (m > log2(d))` and then at runtime compute `scalar*b/2^m` (`v` is a lattice
  vector and `d` the lattice determinant). This increases the bounds on sub-scalars
  by 1 which we check at runtime before increasing the loop size (we don't target
  constant-timeness). `m` is chosen to be a machine word twice big than `log2(d)`
  so that we rarely need to increase the loop size. Hence why the issue happens only
  *sometimes* if we omit to increase the bounds. This bounds increase was implemented
  in G1 and G2 but forgot in GT.\n\n### Workarounds\nUpdating to `v0.12.1+`. Alternatively,
  use `Exp` or `ExpCyclotomic` instead. We are not aware of any users using `ExpGLV`
  anyway.\n\n### References\n- Fix PR: https://github.com/Consensys/gnark-crypto/pull/451
