title: "Always-Incorrect Control Flow Implementation"
description: "Cronos is a commercial implementation of a blockchain. In Cronos nodes
  running versions before v0.6.5, it is possible to take transaction fees from Cosmos
  SDK's FeeCollector for the current block by sending a custom crafted MsgEthereumTx.
  This problem has been patched in Cronos v0.6.5. There are no tested workarounds.
  All validator node operators are recommended to upgrade to Cronos v0.6.5 at their
  earliest possible convenience."
