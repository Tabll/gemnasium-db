title: "Account compromise in Evmos"
description: "Evmos is the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Hub on the Cosmos Network.
  In versions of evmos prior to 2.0.1 attackers are able to drain unclaimed funds
  from user addresses. To do this an attacker must create a new chain which does not
  enforce signature verification and connects it to the target evmos instance. The
  attacker can use this joined chain to transfer unclaimed funds. Users are advised
  to upgrade."
