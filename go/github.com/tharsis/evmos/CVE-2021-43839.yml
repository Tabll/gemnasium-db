description: "Cronos is a commercial implementation of a blockchain. In Cronos nodes
  running versions before v0.6.5, it is possible to take transaction fees from Cosmos

  This problem has been patched in Cronos v0.6.5. There are no tested workarounds.
  All validator node operators are recommended to upgrade to Cronos v0.6.5 at their
