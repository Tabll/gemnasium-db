  actions"
description: "Mattermost versions 10.4.x <= 10.4.2, 10.5.x <= 10.5.0, 9.11.x <= 9.11.10
  fail to validate the uniqueness and quantity of task actions within the UpdateRunTaskActions

  number of actions triggered by specific posts, overloading the server and leading
  to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition."
