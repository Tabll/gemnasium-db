title: "Mattermost fails to strip `embeds` from `metadata` when broadcasting `posted`
  events"
description: "Mattermost does not strip `embeds` from `metadata` when broadcasting
  `posted` events.\n\nThis allows users to include arbitrary embeds in posts, which
  are then broadcasted via websockets. This can be exploited in many ways, for example
  to create permalinks with fully customizable content or to trigger a client Side
  Denial of Service (DoS) by sending a permalink with a non-string message.\n\nThe
  advisory metadata references the appropriate go pseudo version available from pkg.go.dev"
