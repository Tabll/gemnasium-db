title: "Mattermost allows remote actor to set arbitrary RemoteId values for synced
  users"
description: "Mattermost versions 9.9.x <= 9.9.0 and 9.5.x <= 9.5.6 fail to validate
  the source of sync messages and only allow the correct remote IDs, which allows
  a malicious remote to set arbitrary RemoteId values for synced users and therefore claim
  that a user was synced from another remote."
