title: "Mattermost Playbooks fails to validate the uniqueness and quantity of task
  actions"
description: "Mattermost versions 10.4.x <= 10.4.2, 10.5.x <= 10.5.0, 9.11.x <= 9.11.10
  fail to validate the uniqueness and quantity of task actions within the UpdateRunTaskActions
  GraphQL operation, which allows an attacker to create task items containing an excessive
  number of actions triggered by specific posts, overloading the server and leading
  to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition."
