title: "Mattermost fails to properly validate OAuth state tokens during OpenID Connect
  authentication"
description: "Mattermost versions 10.12.x <= 10.12.1, 10.11.x <= 10.11.4, 10.5.x <=
  10.5.12, 11.0.x <= 11.0.3 fail to properly validate OAuth state tokens during OpenID
  Connect authentication which allows an authenticated attacker with team creation
  privileges to take over a user account via manipulation of authentication data during
  the OAuth completion flow. This requires email verification to be disabled (default:
  disabled), OAuth/OpenID Connect to be enabled, and the attacker to control two users
  in the SSO system with one of them never having logged into Mattermost."
