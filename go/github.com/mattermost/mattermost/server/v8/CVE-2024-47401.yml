package_slug: "go/github.com/mattermost/mattermost/server/v8"
title: "Mattermost Server vulnerable to application crash from attacker-generated
  large response"
description: "Mattermost versions 9.10.x <= 9.10.2, 9.11.x <= 9.11.1 and 9.5.x <=
  9.5.9 fail to prevent detailed error messages from being displayed in Playbooks
  which allows an attacker to generate a large response and cause an amplified GraphQL
  response which in turn could cause the application to crash by sending a specially
  crafted request to Playbooks."
