title: "Mattermost with Jira plugin enabled has Incorrect Implementation of Authentication
  Algorithm"
description: "Mattermost versions 11.1.x <= 11.1.0, 11.0.x <= 11.0.5, 10.12.x <= 10.12.3,
  10.11.x <= 10.11.7 with the Jira plugin enabled and Mattermost Jira plugin versions
  <=4.4.0 fail to enforce authentication and issue-key path restrictions in the Jira
  plugin, which allows an unauthenticated attacker who knows a valid user ID to issue
  authenticated GET and POST requests to the Jira server via crafted plugin payloads
  that spoof the user ID and inject arbitrary issue key paths. Mattermost Advisory
