title: "Mattermost fails to limit the size of a request path"
description: "Mattermost versions 8.1.x <= 8.1.10, 9.6.x <= 9.6.0, 9.5.x <= 9.5.2
  and 8.1.x <= 8.1.11 fail to limit the size of a request path that includes user
  inputs which allows an attacker to cause excessive resource consumption, possibly
  leading to a DoS via sending large request paths"
