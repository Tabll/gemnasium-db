title: "Mattermost Fails to Sanitize Path Traversal Sequences"
description: "Mattermost versions 10.8.x <= 10.8.3, 10.5.x <= 10.5.8, 9.11.x <= 9.11.17,
  10.9.x <= 10.9.2 fails to sanitize path traversal sequences in template file destination
  paths, which allows a system admin to perform path traversal attacks via malicious
  path components, potentially enabling malicious file placement outside intended
  directories."
