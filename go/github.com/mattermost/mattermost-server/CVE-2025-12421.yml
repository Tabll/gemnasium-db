title: "Mattermost fails to to verify the token used during code exchange"
description: "Mattermost versions 11.0.x <= 11.0.2, 10.12.x <= 10.12.1, 10.11.x <=
  10.11.4, 10.5.x <= 10.5.12 fail to to verify that the token used during the code
  exchange originates from the same authentication flow, which allows an authenticated
  user to perform account takeover via a specially crafted email address used when
  switching authentication methods and sending a request to the /users/login/sso/code-exchange
  endpoint. The vulnerability requires ExperimentalEnableAuthenticationTransfer to
  be enabled (default: enabled) and RequireEmailVerification to be disabled (default:
  disabled)."
