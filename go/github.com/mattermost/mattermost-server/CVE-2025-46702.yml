title: "Mattermost Incorrect Authorization vulnerability"
description: "Mattermost versions 10.5.x <= 10.5.5, 9.11.x <= 9.11.15, 10.8.x <= 10.8.0,
  10.7.x <= 10.7.2, 10.6.x <= 10.6.5 fail to properly enforce channel member management
  permissions when adding participants to playbook runs. This allows authenticated
  users with member-level permissions to bypass system admin restrictions and add
  or remove users to/from private channels via the playbook run participants feature,
  even when the 'Manage Members' permission has been explicitly removed. This can
  lead to unauthorized access to sensitive channel content and allow guest users to
  gain channel management privileges."
