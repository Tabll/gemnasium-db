title: "Mattermost doesn't validate user channel membership when attaching Mattermost
  posts as comments to Jira issues"
description: "Mattermost versions 11.1.x <= 11.1.0, 11.0.x <= 11.0.5, 10.12.x <= 10.12.3,
  10.11.x <= 10.11.7 fails to validate user channel membership when attaching Mattermost

  have access to."
