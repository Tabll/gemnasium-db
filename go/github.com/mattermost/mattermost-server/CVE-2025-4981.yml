title: "Mattermost allows authenticated users to write files to arbitrary locations"
description: "Mattermost versions 10.5.x <= 10.5.5, 9.11.x <= 9.11.15, 10.8.x <= 10.8.0,
  10.7.x <= 10.7.2, 10.6.x <= 10.6.5 fail to sanitize filenames in the archive extractor
  which allows authenticated users to write files to arbitrary locations on the filesystem
  via uploading archives with path traversal sequences in filenames, potentially leading
  to remote code execution. The vulnerability impacts instances where file uploads
  and document search by content is enabled (FileSettings.EnableFileAttachments =
  true and FileSettings.ExtractContent = true). These configuration settings are enabled
  by default."
