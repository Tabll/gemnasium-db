title: "Bad documentation of error handling in ParseWithClaims can lead to potentially
  dangerous situations"
description: "Unclear documentation of the error behavior in `ParseWithClaims` can
  lead to situation where users are potentially not checking errors in the way they
  should be. Especially, if a token is both expired and invalid, the errors returned
  by `ParseWithClaims` return both error codes. If users only check for the `jwt.ErrTokenExpired
  ` using `error.Is`, they will ignore the embedded `jwt.ErrTokenSignatureInvalid`
  and thus potentially accept invalid tokens."
