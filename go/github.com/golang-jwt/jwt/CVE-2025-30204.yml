title: "jwt-go allows excessive memory allocation during header parsing"
description: "Function [`parse.ParseUnverified`](https://github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/blob/c035977d9e11c351f4c05dfeae193923cbab49ee/parser.go#L138-L139)
  currently splits (via a call to [strings.Split](https://pkg.go.dev/strings#Split))
  its argument (which is untrusted data) on periods.\n\nAs a result, in the face of
  a malicious request whose _Authorization_ header consists of `Bearer ` followed
  by many period characters, a call to that function incurs allocations to the tune
  of O(n) bytes (where n stands for the length of the function's argument), with a
  constant factor of about 16. Relevant weakness: [CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption
  (Amplification)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/405.html)"
