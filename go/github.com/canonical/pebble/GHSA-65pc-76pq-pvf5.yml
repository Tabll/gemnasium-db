title: "Duplicate Advisory: Pebble service manager's file pull API allows access by
  any user"
description: "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-4685-2x5r-65pj. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n## Original Description\nIt was discovered that Pebble's read-file
  API and the associated pebble pull command, before v1.10.2, allowed unprivileged
  local users to read files with root-equivalent permissions when Pebble was running
  as root. Fixes are also available as backports to v1.1.1, v1.4.2, and v1.7.4."
