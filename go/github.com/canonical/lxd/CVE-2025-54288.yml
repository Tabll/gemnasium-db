title: "Canonical LXD Source Container Identification Vulnerability via cmdline Spoofing
  in devLXD Server"
description: "In LXD's devLXD server, the source container identification process
  uses process cmdline (command line) information, allowing attackers to impersonate
  other containers by spoofing process names.\n\nThe core issue lies in the findContainerForPID
  function in `lxd/api_devlxd.go`.\nThis function identifies senders through two steps
  as shown below:\n\n1. cmdline-based identification: Check while tracing back through
  parent processes, and if it starts with `[lxc monitor]`, extract the project name
  and container name from that process name in the format projectName_containerName.\n2.
  PID namespace-based identification: If not found in Step 1, check against all containers'
  PID namespaces.\n\nhttps://github.com/canonical/lxd/blob/43d5189564d27f6161b430ed258c8b56603c2759/lxd/api_devlxd.go#L166-L276\n\nAttackers
  can exploit Step 1 processing to impersonate arbitrary containers across projects
  by spoofing process names."
