title: "Canonical LXD CSRF Vulnerability When Using Client Certificate Authentication
  with the LXD-UI"
description: "OIDC authentication uses cookies with the SameSite=Strict attribute,
  preventing cookies from being sent with requests from other sites. Therefore, CSRF
  does not occur as long as web services in a Same Site relationship (same eTLD+1)
  with the origin running LXD-UI are trusted.\n\nHowever, since the SameSite concept
  does not apply to client certificates, CSRF protection that doesn't rely on the
  SameSite attribute is necessary.\n\nNote that when using cross-origin fetch API,
  client certificates are not sent in no-cors mode due to CORS restrictions (according
  to the WHATWG Fetch specification(https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#credentials), client
  certificates are treated as credentials), making cross-site attacks using fetch
  API difficult unless CORS settings are vulnerable. However, since LXD's API parses
  request bodies as JSON even when `Content-Type` is `text/plain` or `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`,
  CSRF attacks exploiting HTML form submissions are possible."
