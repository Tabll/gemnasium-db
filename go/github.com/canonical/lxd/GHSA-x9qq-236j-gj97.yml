title: "Canonical LXD documentation improvement to make clear restricted.devices.disk=allow
  without restricted.devices.disk.paths also allows shift=true"
description: "If a user has restricted access to a project that is configured with
  `restricted=true`, they can gain root access on the system by creating a disk device
  with `shift=true` and creating a setuid root executable. This is possible because
  the `shift` property is not restricted unless `restricted.devices.disk.paths` is
  set."
