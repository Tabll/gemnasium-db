title: "lxd CA certificate sign check bypass"
description: "If a `server.ca` file is present in `LXD_DIR` at LXD start up, LXD is
  in \"PKI mode\". In this mode, only TLS clients that have a CA-signed certificate
  should be able to authenticate with LXD.\n\nWe have discovered that if a client
  that sends a non-CA signed certificate during the TLS handshake, that client is
  able to authenticate with LXD if their certificate is present in the trust store.\n-
  The LXD Go client (and by extension `lxc`) does not send non-CA signed certificates
  during the handshake.\n- A manual client (e.g. `cURL`) might send a non-CA signed
  certificate during the handshake."
