title: "Duplicate Advisory: Permissive Regular Expression in tacquito"
description: "Tacquito prior to commit 07b49d1358e6ec0b5aa482fcd284f509191119e2 was
  not properly performing regex matches on authorized commands and arguments. Configured
  allowed commands/arguments were intended to require a match on the entire string,
  but instead only enforced a match on a sub-string. That would have potentially allowed
  unauthorized commands to be executed."
