package_slug: "go/github.com/bradleyfalzon/ghinstallation"
title: "ghinstallation returns app JWT in error responses"
description: "In ghinstallation v1, when the request to refresh an installation
  token failed, the HTTP request and response would be returned for debugging.
  The request contained the bearer JWT for the App, and was returned back to clients.
  This token is short lived (10 minute maximum).
  This has been patched in d24f14f8be70d94129d76026e8b0f4f9170c8c3e, and is available in
  releases >= v2.0.0."
