package_slug: "go/github.com/IoFinnet/tss-lib"
title: "Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay"
description: "An issue was discovered in IO FinNet tss-lib before 2.0.0. The parameter
  ssid for defining a session id is not used through the MPC implementation, which
  makes replaying and spoofing of messages easier. In particular, the Schnorr proof
  of knowledge implemented in sch.go does not utilize a session id, context, or random
  nonce in the generation of the challenge. This could allow a malicious user or an
  eavesdropper to replay a valid proof sent in the past."
