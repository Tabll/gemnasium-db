description: "### Impact\n\nimmudb client SDKs use server's UUID to distinguish between
  different server instance so that the client can connect to different immudb instances
  and keep the state for multiple servers. SDK does not validate this uuid and can
  accept any value reported by the server. A malicious server can change the reported
  UUID tricking the client to treat it as a different server thus accepting a state
  completely irrelevant to the one previously retrieved from the server.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe
  following Go SDK versions are not vulnerable\n\n| **SDK** | **Version** |\n|-------|------------|\n|
  [go](pkg.go.dev/github.com/codenotary/immudb/pkg/client) | 1.4.1 |\n\n### Workarounds\n\nWhen
  initializing an immudb client object, a custom state handler can be used to store
  the state. Providing custom implementation that ignores the server UUID can be used
  to ensure that even if the server changes the UUID, client will still consider it
  to be the same server.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions
