title: "Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity"
description: "immudb is a database with built-in cryptographic proof and verification.
  immudb client SDKs use server's UUID to distinguish between different server instance
  so that the client can connect to different immudb instances and keep the state
  for multiple servers. SDK does not validate this uuid and can accept any value reported
  by the server. A malicious server can change the reported UUID tricking the client
  to treat it as a different server thus accepting a state completely irrelevant to
  the one previously retrieved from the server. This issue has been patched in version
  1.4.1. As a workaround, when initializing an immudb client object a custom state
  handler can be used to store the state. Providing custom implementation that ignores
  the server UUID can be used to ensure that even if the server changes the UUID,
  client will still consider it to be the same server."
