package_slug: "go/github.com/codenotary/immudb/embedded/store"
title: "Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity"
description: "immudb is a database with built-in cryptographic proof and verification.
  In versions prior to 1.4.1, a malicious immudb server can provide a falsified proof
  that will be accepted by the client SDK signing a falsified transaction replacing
  the genuine one. This situation can not be triggered by a genuine immudb server
  and requires the client to perform a specific list of verified operations resulting
  in acceptance of an invalid state value. This vulnerability only affects immudb
  client SDKs, the immudb server itself is not affected by this vulnerability. This
  issue has been patched in version 1.4.1."
