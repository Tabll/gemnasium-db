title: "Incus creates nftables rules that partially bypass security options"
description: "When using an ACL on a device connected to a bridge, Incus generates
  nftables rules that partially bypass security options `security.mac_filtering`,
  `security.ipv4_filtering` and `security.ipv6_filtering`. This can lead to ARP spoofing
  on the bridge and to fully spoof another VM/container on the same bridge."
