package_slug: "go/github.com/lxc/incus/v6"
title: "Incus container environment configuration newline injection"
description: "A user with the ability to launch a container with a custom YAML configuration
  (e.g a member of the ‘incus’ group) can create an environment variable containing
  newlines, which can be used to add additional configuration items in the container’s
  `lxc.conf` due to the newline injection. This can allow adding arbitrary lifecycle
  hooks, ultimately resulting in arbitrary command execution on the host."
