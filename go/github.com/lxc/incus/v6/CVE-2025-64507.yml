title: "Incus vulnerable to local privilege escalation through custom storage volumes"
description: "This affects any Incus user in an environment where an unprivileged
  user may have root access to a container with an attached custom storage volume
  that has the `security.shifted` property set to `true` as well as access to the
  host as an unprivileged user.\n\nThe most common case for this would be systems
  using `incus-user` with the less privileged `incus` group to provide unprivileged
  users with an isolated restricted access to Incus. Such users may be able to create
  a custom storage volume with the necessary property (depending on kernel and filesystem
  support) and can then write a setuid binary from within the container which can
  be executed as an unpriivleged user on the host to gain root privileges."
