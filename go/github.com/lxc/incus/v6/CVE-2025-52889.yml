package_slug: "go/github.com/lxc/incus/v6"
title: "Incus Allocation of Resources Without Limits allows firewall rule bypass on
  managed bridge networks"
description: "When using an ACL on a device connected to a bridge, Incus generates
  nftables rules for local services (DHCP, DNS...) that partially bypass security
  options `security.mac_filtering`, `security.ipv4_filtering` and `security.ipv6_filtering`.
  This can lead to DHCP pool exhaustion and opens the door for other attacks."
