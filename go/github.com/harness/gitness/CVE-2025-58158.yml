description: "Open Source Harness git LFS server (Gitness)  exposes api to retrieve
  and upload files via git LFS.  Implementation of upload git LFS file api is vulnerable
  to arbitrary file write.  Due to improper sanitization for upload path, a malicious

  compromise the server.\n\nUsers using git LFS are vulnerable."
