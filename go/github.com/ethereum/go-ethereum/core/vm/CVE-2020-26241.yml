title: "Incorrect Calculation"
description: "Go Ethereum, or \"Geth\", is the official Golang implementation of the
  Ethereum protocol. This is a Consensus vulnerability in Geth before version 1.9.17
  which can be used to cause a chain-split where vulnerable nodes reject the canonical
  chain. Geth's pre-compiled dataCopy (at 0x00...04) contract did a shallow copy on
  invocation. An attacker could deploy a contract that writes X to an EVM memory region
  R, then calls 0x00..04 with R as an argument, then overwrites R to Y, and finally
  invokes the RETURNDATACOPY opcode. When this contract is invoked, a consensus-compliant
  node would push X on the EVM stack, whereas Geth would push Y. This is fixed in
  version 1.9.17."
