description: "Go Ethereum, or \"Geth\", is the official Golang implementation of the
  Ethereum protocol. In Geth from version 1.9.4 and before version 1.9.20 a consensus-vulnerability
  could cause a chain split, where vulnerable versions refuse to accept the canonical
  chain. The fix was included in the Paragade release version 1.9.20. No individual
  workaround patches have been made -- all users are recommended to upgrade to a newer
  version."
