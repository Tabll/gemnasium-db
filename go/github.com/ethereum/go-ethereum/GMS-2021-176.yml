title: "Denial of service in go-ethereum due to CVE-2020-28362"
description: "### Impact\nVersions of Geth built with Go `<1.15.5` or `<1.14.12` are
  most likely affected by a critical DoS-related security vulnerability. The golang
  team has registered the underlying flaw as ‘CVE-2020-28362’.\n\nWe recommend all
  users to rebuild (ideally `v1.9.24`) with Go `1.15.5` or `1.14.12`, to avoid node
  crashes. Alternatively, if you are running binaries distributed via one of our official
  channels, we’re going to release `v1.9.24` ourselves built with Go `1.15.5`.\n\n###
  Patches\nThis is not an issue in go-ethereum, rebuilding an older version with Go
  `1.15.5` or `1.14.12` will suffice to address the vulnerability. \n\n### Workarounds\nRebuilding
  with Go `1.15.5` or `1.14.12` will suffice to address the vulnerability. \n\n###
