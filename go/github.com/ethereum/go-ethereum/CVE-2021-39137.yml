title: "Ethereum Contains Consensus Flaw During Block Processing"
description: "A memory-corruption bug within the EVM can cause a consensus error,
  where vulnerable nodes obtain a different `stateRoot` when processing a maliciously
  crafted transaction. This, in turn, would lead to the chain being split in two forks.\n\nAll
  Geth versions supporting the London hard fork are vulnerable (which predates London),
  so all users should update.\n\nThis bug was exploited on Mainnet at block 13107518,
  leading to a minority chain split."
