title: "Denial of service in go-ethereum due to CVE-2020-28362"
description: "Versions of Geth built with Go `<1.15.5` or `<1.14.12` are most likely
  affected by a critical DoS-related security vulnerability. The golang team has registered
  the underlying flaw as ‘CVE-2020-28362’.\n\nWe recommend all users to rebuild (ideally
  `v1.9.24`) with Go `1.15.5` or `1.14.12`, to avoid node crashes. Alternatively,
  if you are running binaries distributed via one of our official channels, we’re
  going to release `v1.9.24` ourselves built with Go `1.15.5`."
