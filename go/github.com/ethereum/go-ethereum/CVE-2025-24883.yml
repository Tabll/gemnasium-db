title: "Go Ethereum vulnerable to DoS via malicious p2p message"
description: "A vulnerable node can be forced to shutdown/crash using a specially
  crafted message.\n\nDuring the peer-to-peer connection handshake, a shared secret
  key is computed. The implementation\ndid not verify whether the EC public key provided
  by the remote party is a valid point on the secp256k1 curve.\nBy simply sending
  an all-zero public key, a crash could be induced due to unexpected results from
  the handshake.\n\nThe issue was fixed by adding a curve point validity check in
