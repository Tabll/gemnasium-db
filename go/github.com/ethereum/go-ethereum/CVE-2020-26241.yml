title: "Shallow copy bug in geth"
description: "This is a Consensus vulnerability, which can be used to cause a chain-split
  where vulnerable nodes reject the canonical chain.\n\nGethâ€™s pre-compiled `dataCopy`
  (at `0x00...04`) contract did a shallow copy on invocation. An attacker could deploy
  a contract that\n\n- writes `X` to an EVM memory region `R`,\n- calls `0x00..04`
  with `R` as an argument,\n- overwrites `R` to `Y`,\n- and finally invokes the `RETURNDATACOPY`
  opcode.\n\nWhen this contract is invoked, a consensus-compliant node would push
  `X` on the EVM stack, whereas Geth would push `Y`."
