package_slug: "go/github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum"
title: "Incorrect Calculation"
description: "Go Ethereum, or \"Geth\", is the official Golang implementation of the
  Ethereum protocol. This is a Consensus vulnerability in Geth which can be used to
  cause a chain-split where vulnerable nodes reject the canonical chain. Geth's pre-compiled
  dataCopy (at `0x00..0x04`) contract did a shallow copy on invocation. An attacker
  could deploy a contract that writes X to an EVM memory region R, then calls `0x00..0x04`
  with R as an argument, then overwrites R to Y, and finally invokes the `RETURNDATACOPY`
  opcode. When this contract is invoked, a consensus-compliant node would push X on
  the EVM stack, whereas Geth would push Y. This is fixed "
