title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "Go Ethereum is the official Golang implementation of the Ethereum protocol.
  Prior to version 1.10.17, a vulnerable node, if configured to use high verbosity
  logging, can be made to crash when handling specially crafted p2p messages sent
  from an attacker node. Version 1.10.17 contains a patch that addresses the problem.
  As a workaround, setting loglevel to default level (`INFO`) makes the node not vulnerable
  to this attack."
