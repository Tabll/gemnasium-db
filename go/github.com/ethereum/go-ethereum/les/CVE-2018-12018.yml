package_slug: "go/github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/les"
title: "Improper Validation of Array Index"
description: "The GetBlockHeadersMsg handler in the LES protocol implementation in
  Go Ethereum (aka geth) before 1.8.11 may lead to an access violation because of
  an integer signedness error for the array index, which allows attackers to launch
  a Denial of Service attack by sending a packet with a -1 query.Skip value. The vulnerable
  remote node would be crashed by such an attack immediately, aka the EPoD (Ethereum
  Packet of Death) issue."
