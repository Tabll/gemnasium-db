description: "A design flaw in all versions of Go-Ethereum allows an attacker node
  to send 5120 pending transactions of a high gas price from one account that all
  fully spend the full balance of the account to a victim Geth node, which can purge
  all of pending transactions in a victim node's memory pool and then occupy the memory
  pool to prevent new transactions from entering the pool, resulting in a denial of
  service (DoS)."
