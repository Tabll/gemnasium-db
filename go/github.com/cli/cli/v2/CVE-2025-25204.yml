title: "`gh attestation verify` returns incorrect exit code during verification if
  no attestations are present"
description: "A bug in GitHub's Artifact Attestation CLI tool, `gh attestation verify`,
  may return an incorrect zero exit status when no matching attestations are found
  for the specified `--predicate-type <value>` or the default `https://slsa.dev/provenance/v1`
  if not specified. This issue only arises if an artifact has an attestation with
  a predicate type different from the one provided in the command. As a result, users
  relying solely on these exit codes may mistakenly believe the attestation has been
  verified, despite the absence of an attestation with the specified predicate type
  and the tool printing a verification failure.\n\nUsers are advised to update `gh`
  to version `v2.67.0` as soon as possible.\n\nInitial report: https://github.com/cli/cli/issues/10418\nFix:
