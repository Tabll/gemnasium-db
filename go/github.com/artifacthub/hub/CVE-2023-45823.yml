title: "Artifact Hub arbitrary file read vulnerability"
description: "Artifact Hub is a web-based application that enables finding, installing,
  and publishing packages and configurations for CNCF projects. During a security
  audit of Artifact Hub's code base a security researcher identified a bug in which
  by using symbolic links in certain kinds of repositories loaded into Artifact Hub,
  it was possible to read internal files. Artifact Hub indexes content from a variety
  of sources, including git repositories. When processing git based repositories,
  Artifact Hub clones the repository and, depending on the artifact kind, reads some
  files from it. During this process, in some cases, no validation was done to check
  if the file was a symbolic link. This made possible to read arbitrary files in the
  system, potentially leaking sensitive information. This issue has been resolved
  in version `1.16.0`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
  for this vulnerability."
