title: "pgproto3 SQL Injection via Protocol Message Size Overflow"
description: "### Impact\n\nSQL injection can occur if an attacker can cause a single
  query or bind message to exceed 4 GB in size. An integer overflow in the calculated
  message size can cause the one large message to be sent as multiple messages under
  the attacker's control.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem is resolved in v2.3.3\n\n###
  Workarounds\n\nReject user input large enough to cause a single query or bind message
  to exceed 4 GB in size.\n"
