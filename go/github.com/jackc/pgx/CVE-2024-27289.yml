title: "pgx SQL Injection via Line Comment Creation"
description: "### Impact\n\nSQL injection can occur when all of the following conditions
  are met:\n\n1. The non-default simple protocol is used.\n2. A placeholder for a
  numeric value must be immediately preceded by a minus.\n3. There must be a second
  placeholder for a string value after the first placeholder; both\nmust be on the
  same line.\n4. Both parameter values must be user-controlled.\n\ne.g. \n\nSimple
  mode must be enabled:\n\n```go\n// connection string includes \"prefer_simple_protocol=true\"\n//
  or\n// directly enabled in code\nconfig.ConnConfig.PreferSimpleProtocol = true\n```\n\nParameterized
  query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM example WHERE result=-$1 OR name=$2;\n```\n\nParameter
  values:\n\n`$1` => `-42`\n`$2` => `\"foo\\n 1 AND 1=0 UNION SELECT * FROM secrets;
  --\"`\n\nResulting query after preparation:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM example WHERE
  result=--42 OR name= 'foo\n1 AND 1=0 UNION SELECT * FROM secrets; --';\n```\n\n###
  Patches\n\nThe problem is resolved in v4.18.2.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nDo not use
  the simple protocol or do not place a minus directly before a placeholder.\n"
