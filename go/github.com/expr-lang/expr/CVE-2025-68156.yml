title: "Expr has Denial of Service via Unbounded Recursion in Builtin Functions"
description: "Several builtin functions in Expr, including `flatten`, `min`, `max`,
  `mean`, and `median`, perform\nrecursive traversal over user-provided data structures
  without enforcing a maximum recursion depth.\n\nIf the evaluation environment contains
  **deeply nested** or **cyclic** data structures, these functions may recurse\nindefinitely
  until exceed the Go runtime stack limit. This results in a **stack overflow panic**,
  causing the host\napplication to crash.\n\nWhile exploitability depends on whether
  an attacker can influence or inject cyclic or pathologically deep data into the\nevaluation
  environment, this behavior represents a denial-of-service (DoS) risk and affects
  overall library robustness.\nInstead of returning a recoverable evaluation error,
  the process may terminate unexpectedly."
