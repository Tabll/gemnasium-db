title: "OpenTelemetry Collector module AWS Firehose Receiver Authentication Bypass
  Vulnerability"
description: "OpenTelemetry Collector module [`awsfirehosereceiver`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/awsfirehosereceiver)
  allows unauthenticated remote requests, even when configured to require a key.\n\nOpenTelemetry
  Collector can be configured to receive CloudWatch metrics via an AWS Firehose Stream.
  [Firehose sets the header](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/httpdeliveryrequestresponse.html)
  `X-Amz-Firehose-Access-Key` with an arbitrary configured string. The OpenTelemetry
  Collector awsfirehosereceiver can optionally be configured to require this key on
  incoming requests. However, when this is configured it **still accepts incoming
  requests with no key**."
