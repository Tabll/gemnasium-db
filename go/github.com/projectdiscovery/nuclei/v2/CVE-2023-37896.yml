title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "Nuclei is a vulnerability scanner. Prior to version 2.9.9, a security
  issue in the Nuclei project affected users utilizing Nuclei as Go code (SDK) running
  custom templates. This issue does not affect CLI users. The problem was related
  to sanitization issues with payload loading in sandbox mode. There was a potential
  risk with payloads loading in sandbox mode. The issue occurred due to relative paths
  not being converted to absolute paths before doing the check for `sandbox` flag
  allowing arbitrary files to be read on the filesystem in certain cases when using
  Nuclei from `Go` SDK implementation. \n\nThis issue has been fixed in version 2.9.9.
  The maintainers have also enabled sandbox by default for filesystem loading. This
  can be optionally disabled if required. The `-sandbox` option has been deprecated
  and is now divided into two new options: `-lfa` (allow local file access) which
  is enabled by default and `-lna` (restrict local network access) which can be enabled
  by users optionally. The `-lfa` allows file (payload) access anywhere on the system
  (disabling sandbox effectively), and `-lna` blocks connections to the local/private
  network."
