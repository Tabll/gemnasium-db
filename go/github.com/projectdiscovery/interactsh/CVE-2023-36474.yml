package_slug: "go/github.com/projectdiscovery/interactsh"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "Interactsh is an open-source tool for detecting out-of-band interactions.
  Domains configured with interactsh server prior to version 1.0.0 were vulnerable
  to subdomain takeover for a specific subdomain, i.e `app.` Interactsh server used
  to create cname entries for `app` pointing to `projectdiscovery.github.io` as default,
  which intended to used for hosting interactsh web client using GitHub pages. This
  is a security issue with a self-hosted interactsh server in which the user may not
  have configured a web client but still have a CNAME entry pointing to GitHub pages,
  making them vulnerable to subdomain takeover. This allows a threat actor to host
  / run arbitrary client side code (cross-site scripting) in a user's browser when
  browsing the vulnerable subdomain. Version 1.0.0 fixes this issue by making CNAME
  optional, rather than default."
