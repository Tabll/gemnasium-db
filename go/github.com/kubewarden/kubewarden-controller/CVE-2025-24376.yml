package_slug: "go/github.com/kubewarden/kubewarden-controller"
title: "KubeWarden's AdmissionPolicy and AdmissionPolicyGroup policies can be used
  to alter PolicyReport resources"
description: "By design, AdmissionPolicy and AdmissionPolicyGroup can evaluate only
  namespaced resources. The resources to be evaluated are determined by the rules
  provided by the user when defining the policy.\nThere might be Kubernetes namespaced
  resources that should not be validated by AdmissionPolicy and by the AdmissionPolicyGroup
  policies because of their sensitive nature.\nFor example, PolicyReport are namespaced
  resources that contain the list of non compliant objects found inside of a namespace.
  See [this section](https://docs.kubewarden.io/explanations/audit-scanner/policy-reports)
  of Kubewardenâ€™s documentation for more details about PolicyReport resources.\nAn
  attacker can use either an AdmissionPolicy or an AdmissionPolicyGroup to prevent
  the creation and update of PolicyReport objects to hide non-compliant resources.\nMoreover,
  the same attacker might use a mutating AdmissionPolicy to alter the contents of
  the PolicyReport created inside of the namespace."
