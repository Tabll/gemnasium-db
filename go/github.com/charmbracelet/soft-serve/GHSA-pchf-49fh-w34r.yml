title: "Soft Serve Affected by an Authentication Bypass"
description: "_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nThis issue impacts
  every Soft Serve instance.\n\nA critical authentication bypass allows an attacker
  to impersonate any user (including Admin) by \"offering\" the victim's public key
  during the SSH handshake before authenticating with their own valid key. This occurs
  because the user identity is stored in the session context during the \"offer\"
  phase and is not cleared if that specific authentication attempt fails."
