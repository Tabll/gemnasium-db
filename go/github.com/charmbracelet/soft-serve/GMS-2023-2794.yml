title: "Soft Serve Public Key Authentication Bypass Vulnerability when Keyboard-Interactive
  SSH Authentication is Enabled"
description: "### Impact\n\nA security vulnerability in Soft Serve could allow an
  unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass public key authentication when keyboard-interactive
  SSH authentication is active, through the `allow-keyless` setting, and the public
  key requires additional client-side verification for example using FIDO2 or GPG.
  This is due to insufficient validation procedures of the public key step during
  SSH request handshake, granting unauthorized access if the keyboard-interaction
  mode is utilized. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by presenting manipulated
  SSH requests using keyboard-interactive authentication mode. This could potentially
  result in unauthorized access to the Soft Serve.\n\n### Patches\n\nUsers should
  upgrade to the latest Soft Serve version `v0.6.2` to receive the patch for this
  issue. \n\n### Workarounds\n\nTo workaround this vulnerability without upgrading,
  users can _temporarily_ disable Keyboard-Interactive SSH Authentication using the
  `allow-keyless` setting.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://github.com/charmbracelet/soft-serve/issues/389"
