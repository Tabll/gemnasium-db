- "CVE-2022-29180"
package_slug: "go/github.com/charmbracelet/charm"
title: "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
description: "A vulnerability in which attackers could forge HTTP requests to manipulate
  the `charm` data directory to access or delete anything on the server. This has
  been patched and is available in release [v0.12.1](https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm/releases/tag/v0.12.1).
  We recommend that all users running self-hosted `charm` instances update immediately.
  This vulnerability was found in-house and we haven't been notified of any potential
  exploiters. ### Additional notes * Encrypted user data uploaded to the Charm server
  is safe as Charm servers cannot decrypt user data. This includes filenames, paths,
  and all key-value data. * Users running the official Charm [Docker images](https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm/blob/main/docker.md)
  are at minimal risk because the exploit is limited to the containerized filesystem."
