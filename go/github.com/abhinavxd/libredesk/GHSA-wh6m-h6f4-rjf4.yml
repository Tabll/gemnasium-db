title: "Libredesk has Improper Neutralization of  HTML Tags in a Web Page"
description: "LibreDesk is vulnerable to **stored HTML injection** in the contact
  notes feature. When adding notes via `POST /api/v1/contacts/{id}/notes`, the backend
  automatically wraps user input in `<p>` tags. However, by intercepting the request
  and removing the `<p>` tag, an attacker can inject arbitrary HTML elements such
  as forms and images, which are then stored and rendered without proper sanitization.
  This can lead to phishing, CSRF-style forced actions, and UI redress attacks.\n\n---"
