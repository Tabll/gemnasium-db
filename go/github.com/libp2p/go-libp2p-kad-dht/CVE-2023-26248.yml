title: "Content Censorship in the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) via Kademlia DHT
  abuse"
description: "The Kademlia DHT (go-libp2p-kad-dht 0.20.0 and earlier) used in IPFS
  (0.18.1 and earlier) assigns routing information for content (i.e., information
  about who holds the content) to be stored by peers whose peer IDs have a small DHT
  distance from the content ID. This allows an attacker to censor content by generating
  many Sybil peers whose peer IDs have a small distance from the content ID, thus
  hijacking the content resolution process."
