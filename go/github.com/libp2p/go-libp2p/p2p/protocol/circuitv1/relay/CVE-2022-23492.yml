package_slug: "go/github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/p2p/protocol/circuitv1/relay"
title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "go-libp2p is the offical libp2p implementation in the Go programming
  language. Version `0.18.0` and older of go-libp2p is vulnerable to targeted resource
  exhaustion attacks. These attacks target libp2p’s connection, stream, peer, and
  memory management. An attacker can cause the allocation of large amounts of memory,
  ultimately leading to the process getting killed by the host’s operating system.
  While a connection manager tasked with keeping the number of connections within
  manageable limits has been part of go-libp2p, this component was designed to handle
  the regular churn of peers, not a targeted resource exhaustion attack. Users are
  advised to upgrade their version of go-libp2p to version `0.18.1` or newer. Users
  unable to upgrade may consult the denial of service (dos) mitigation page for more
  information on how to incorporate mitigation strategies, monitor your application,
  and respond to attacks."
