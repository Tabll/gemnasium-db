package_slug: "go/github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p"
title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "libp2p is a networking stack and library modularized out of The IPFS
  Project, and bundled separately for other tools to use. In go-libp2p, by using signed
  peer records a malicious actor can store an arbitrary amount of data in a remote
  nodeâ€™s memory. This memory does not get garbage collected and so the victim can
  run out of memory and crash. If users of go-libp2p in production are not monitoring
  memory consumption over time, it could be a silent attack i.e. the attacker could
  bring down nodes over a period of time (how long depends on the node resources i.e.
  a go-libp2p node on a virtual server with 4 gb of memory takes about 90 sec to bring
  down; on a larger server, it might take a bit longer.) This issue was patched in
  version 0.27.4."
