package_slug: "go/github.com/pomerium/pomerium"
title: "Excessive Iteration"
description: "Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. Envoy, which
  Pomerium is based on, incorrectly handles resetting of HTTP/2 streams with excessive
  complexity. This can lead to high CPU utilization when a large number of streams
  are reset. This can result in a DoS condition. Pomerium versions 0.14.8 and 0.15.1
  contain an upgraded envoy binary with this vulnerability patched."
