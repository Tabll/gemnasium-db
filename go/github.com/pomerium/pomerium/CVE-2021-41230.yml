package_slug: "go/github.com/pomerium/pomerium"
title: "Incorrect Authorization"
description: "Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. In affected
  versions changes to the OIDC claims of a user after initial login are not reflected
  in policy evaluation when using `allowed_idp_claims` as part of policy. If using
  `allowed_idp_claims` and a user's claims are changed, Pomerium can make incorrect
  authorization decisions. This issue has been resolved in v0.15.6. For users unable
  to upgrade clear data on `databroker` service by clearing redis or restarting the
  in-memory databroker to force claims to be updated."
