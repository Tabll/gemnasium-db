package_slug: "go/github.com/pomerium/pomerium"
title: "Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions"
description: "Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. Envoy, which
  Pomerium is based on, can abnormally terminate if an H/2 GOAWAY and SETTINGS frame
  are received in the same IO event. This can lead to a DoS in the presence of untrusted
  *upstream* servers. 0.15.1 contains an upgraded envoy binary with this vulnerability
  patched. If only trusted upstreams are configured, there is not substantial risk
  of this condition being triggered."
