title: "Pomerium exposed OAuth2 access and ID tokens in user info endpoint response"
description: "The Pomerium user info page (at `/.pomerium`) unintentionally included
  serialized OAuth2 access and ID tokens from the logged-in user's session. These
  tokens are not intended to be exposed to end users.\n\nThis issue may be more severe
  in the presence of an XSS vulnerability in an upstream application proxied through
  Pomerium. If an attacker could insert a malicious script onto a web page proxied
  through Pomerium, that script could access these tokens by making a request to the
  `/.pomerium` endpoint.\n\nUpstream applications that authenticate only the ID token
  may be vulnerable to user impersonation using a token obtained in this manner.\n\nNote
  that an OAuth2 access token or ID token by itself is not sufficient to hijack a
  user's Pomerium session. Upstream applications should not be vulnerable to user
  impersonation via these tokens provided:\n- the application verifies the [Pomerium
  JWT](https://www.pomerium.com/docs/capabilities/getting-users-identity) for each
  request,\n- the connection between Pomerium and the application is secured by mTLS,\n-
  or the connection between Pomerium and the application is otherwise secured at the
  network layer."
