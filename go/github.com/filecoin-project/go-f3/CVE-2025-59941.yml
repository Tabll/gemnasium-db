title: "go-f3 Vulnerable to Cached Justification Verification Bypass"
description: "A vulnerability exists in go-f3's justification verification caching
  mechanism where verification results are cached without properly considering the
  context of the message. An attacker can bypass justification verification by:\n1.
  First submitting a valid message with a correct justification\n2. Then reusing the
  same cached justification in contexts where it would normally be invalid\n\nThis
  occurs because the cached verification does not properly validate the relationship
  between the justification and the specific message context it's being used with."
