title: "go-f3 module vulnerable to integer overflow leading to panic"
description: "Filecoin nodes consuming F3 messages are vulnerable.  go-f3 panics when
  it validates a \"poison\" messages.  A \"poison\" message can can cause integer
  overflow in the signer index validation.  In Lotus' case, the whole node will crash.\n\nThere
  is no barrier to entry.  An attacker doesn't need any power to pull off this attack.\n\nThese
  malicious messages aren't self-propagating since the bug is in the validator.  An
  attacker needs to directly send the message to all targets."
