title: "gardenctl is vulnerable to Command Injection when used with non‑POSIX shells"
description: "A security vulnerability was discovered for [gardenctl](https://github.com/gardener/gardenctl-v2)
  when it is used with non‑POSIX shells such as **[Fish](https://fishshell.com/)**
  and **[PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/)**. Such setup
  could allow an attacker with administrative privileges for a Gardener project to
  craft malicious credential values in infrastructure Secret objects that break out
  of the intended string context when evaluated in Fish or PowerShell environments
  used by the Gardener service operators, leading to arbitrary command execution on
  the operator's device.\n\n**Am I vulnerable?**\nThis CVE affects all Gardener operators
  who use  **gardenctl < v2.12.0** with non‑POSIX shells such as **[Fish](https://fishshell.com/)**
  and **[PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/)**."
