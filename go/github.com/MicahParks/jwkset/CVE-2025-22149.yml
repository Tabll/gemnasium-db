title: "JWK Set's HTTP client only overwrites and appends JWK to local cache during
  refresh"
description: "The project's provided HTTP client's local JWK Set cache should do a
  full replacement when the goroutine refreshes the remote JWK Set. The current behavior
  is to overwrite or append. This is a security issue for use cases that utilize the
  provided auto-caching HTTP client and where key removal from a JWK Set is equivalent
  to revocation.\n\nExample attack scenario:\n1. An attacker has stolen the private
  key for a key published in JWK Set.\n2. The publishers of that JWK Set remove that
  key from the JWK Set.\n3. Enough time has passed that the program using the auto-caching
  HTTP client found in `github.com/MicahParks/jwkset` v0.5.0-v0.5.21 has elapsed its
  `HTTPClientStorageOptions.RefreshInterval` duration, causing a refresh of the remote
  JWK Set.\n4. The attacker is signing content (such as JWTs) with the stolen private
  key and the system has no other forms of revocation."
