package_slug: "go/github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "matrix-media-repo is a highly customizable multi-domain media repository
  for the Matrix chat ecosystem. In affected versions an attacker could upload a malicious
  piece of media to the media repo, which would then be served with `Content-Disposition:
  inline` upon download. This vulnerability could be leveraged to execute scripts
  embedded in SVG content. Commits `77ec235` and `bf8abdd` fix the issue and are included
  in the 1.3.0 release. Operators should upgrade to v1.3.0 as soon as possible. Operators
  unable to upgrade should override the `Content-Disposition` header returned by matrix-media-repo
  as a workaround."
