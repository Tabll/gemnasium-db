title: "Goroutine Leak in Abacus SSE Implementation"
description: "A critical goroutine leak vulnerability has been identified in the Abacus
  server's Server-Sent Events (SSE) implementation. The issue occurs when clients
  disconnect from the `/stream` endpoint, as the server fails to properly clean up
  resources and terminate associated goroutines. This leads to resource exhaustion
  where the server continues running but eventually stops accepting new SSE connections
  while maintaining high memory usage. The vulnerability specifically involves improper
  channel cleanup in the event handling mechanism, causing goroutines to remain blocked
  indefinitely."
