title: "github.com/go-resty/resty/v2 HTTP request body disclosure"
description: "A race condition in go-resty can result in HTTP request body disclosure
  across requests. This condition can be triggered by calling sync.Pool.Put with the
  same *bytes.Buffer more than once, when request retries are enabled and a retry
  occurs. The call to sync.Pool.Get will then return a bytes.Buffer that hasn't had
  bytes.Buffer.Reset called on it. This dirty buffer will contain the HTTP request
  body from an unrelated request, and go-resty will append the current HTTP request
  body to it, sending two bodies in one request. The sync.Pool in question is defined
  at package level scope, so a completely unrelated server could receive the request
  body."
