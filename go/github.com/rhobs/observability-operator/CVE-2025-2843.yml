package_slug: "go/github.com/rhobs/observability-operator"
title: "Observability Operator is vulnerable to Incorrect Privilege Assignment through
  its Custom Resource MonitorStack"
description: "A flaw was found in the Observability Operator. The Operator creates
  a ServiceAccount with *ClusterRole* upon deployment of the *Namespace-Scoped* Custom
  Resource MonitorStack. This issue allows an adversarial Kubernetes Account with
  only namespaced-level roles, for example, a tenant controlling a namespace, to create
  a MonitorStack in the authorized namespace and then elevate permission to the cluster
  level by impersonating the ServiceAccount created by the Operator, resulting in
  privilege escalation and other issues."
