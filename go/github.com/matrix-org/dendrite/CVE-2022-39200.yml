package_slug: "go/github.com/matrix-org/dendrite"
title: "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature"
description: "Dendrite is a Matrix homeserver written in Go. In affected versions
  events retrieved from a remote homeserver using the `/get_missing_events` path does
  not have their signatures verified correctly. This could potentially allow a remote
  homeserver to provide invalid/modified events to Dendrite via this endpoint. Note
  that this does not apply to events retrieved through other endpoints (e.g. `/event`,
  `/state`) as they have been correctly verified. Homeservers that have federation
  disabled are not vulnerable. The problem has been fixed in Dendrite 0.9.8. Users
  are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue."
