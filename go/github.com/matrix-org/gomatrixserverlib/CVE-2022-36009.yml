title: "Incorrect Authorization"
description: "gomatrixserverlib is a Go library for matrix protocol federation. Dendrite
  is a Matrix homeserver written in Go, an alternative to Synapse. The power level
  parsing within gomatrixserverlib was failing to parse the `\"events_default\"` key
  of the `m.room.power_levels` event, defaulting the event default power level to
  zero in all cases. Power levels are the matrix terminology for user access level.
  In rooms where the `\"events_default\"` power level had been changed, this could
  result in events either being incorrectly authorised or rejected by Dendrite servers.
  gomatrixserverlib contains a fix as of commit `723fd49` and Dendrite 0.9.3 has been
  updated accordingly. Matrix rooms where the `\"events_default\"` power level has
  not been changed from the default of zero are not vulnerable. Users are advised
  to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue."
