title: "Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel"
description: "Bleve is a text indexing library for go. Bleve includes HTTP utilities
  under bleve/http package, that are used by its sample application. These HTTP methods
  pave way for exploitation of a node’s filesystem where the bleve index resides,
  if the user has used bleve’s own HTTP (bleve/http) handlers for exposing the access
  to the indexes. For instance, the CreateIndexHandler (`http/index_create.go`) and
  DeleteIndexHandler (`http/index_delete.go`) enable an attacker to create a bleve
  index (directory structure) anywhere where the user running the server has the write
  permissions and to delete recursively any directory owned by the same user account.
  Users who have used the bleve/http package for exposing access to bleve index without
  the explicit handling for the Role Based Access Controls(RBAC) of the index assets
  would be impacted by this issue. There is no patch for this issue because the http
  package is purely intended to be used for demonstration purposes. Bleve was never
  designed handle the RBACs, nor it was ever advertised to be used in that way. The
  collaborators of this project have decided to stay away from adding any authentication
  or authorization to bleve project at the moment. The bleve/http package is mainly
  for demonstration purposes and it lacks exhaustive validation of the user inputs
  as well as any authentication and authorization measures. It is recommended to not
  use bleve/http in production use cases."
