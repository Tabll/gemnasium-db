description: "Casdoor is a UI-first Identity and Access Management (IAM) / Single-Sign-On
  (SSO) platform. In Casdoor 1.577.0 and earlier, a logic vulnerability exists in
  the beego filter CorsFilter that allows any website to make cross domain requests
  to Casdoor as the logged in user. Due to the a logic error in checking only for
  a prefix when authenticating the Origin header, any domain can create a valid subdomain
  with a valid subdomain prefix (Ex: localhost.example.com), allowing the website
  to make requests to Casdoor as the current signed-in user."
