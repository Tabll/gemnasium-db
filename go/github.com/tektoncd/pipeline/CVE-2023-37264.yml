title: "Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity"
description: "Tekton Pipelines project provides k8s-style resources for declaring
  CI/CD-style pipelines. Starting in version 0.35.0, pipelines do not validate child
  UIDs, which means that a user that has access to create TaskRuns can create their
  own Tasks that the Pipelines controller will accept as the child Task. While the
  software stores and validates the PipelineRun's (api version, kind, name, uid) in
  the child Run's OwnerReference, it only store (api version, kind, name) in the ChildStatusReference.
  This means that if a client had access to create TaskRuns on a cluster, they could
  create a child TaskRun for a pipeline with the same name + owner reference, and
  the Pipeline controller picks it up as if it was the original TaskRun. This is problematic
  since it can let users modify the config of Pipelines at runtime, which violates
  SLSA L2 Service Generated / Non-falsifiable requirements. This issue can be used
  to trick the Pipeline controller into associating unrelated Runs to the Pipeline,
  feeding its data through the rest of the Pipeline. This requires access to create
  TaskRuns, so impact may vary depending on one Tekton setup. If users already have
  unrestricted access to create any Task/PipelineRun, this does not grant any additional
  capabilities. As of time of publication, there are no known patches for this issue."
