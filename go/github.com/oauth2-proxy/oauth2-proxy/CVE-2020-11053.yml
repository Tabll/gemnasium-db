title: "URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')"
description: "In OAuth2 Proxy before 5.1.1, there is an open redirect vulnerability.
  Users can provide a redirect address for the proxy to send the authenticated user
  to at the end of the authentication flow. This is expected to be the original URL
  that the user was trying to access. This redirect URL is checked within the proxy
  and validated before redirecting the user to prevent malicious actors providing
  redirects to potentially harmful sites. However, by crafting a redirect URL with
  HTML encoded whitespace characters the validation could be bypassed and allow a
  redirect to any URL provided. This has been patched in 5.1.1."
