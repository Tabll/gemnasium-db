package_slug: "go/github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/v7"
title: "OAuth2-Proxy is vulnerable to header smuggling via underscore leading to potential
  privilege escalation"
description: "All deployments of OAuth2 Proxy in front of applications that normalize
  underscores to dashes in HTTP headers (e.g., WSGI-based frameworks such as Django,
  Flask, FastAPI, and PHP applications).\n\nAuthenticated users can inject underscore
  variants of X-Forwarded-* headers that bypass the proxy’s filtering logic, potentially
  escalating privileges in the upstream app. OAuth2 Proxy authentication/authorization
  itself is not compromised."
