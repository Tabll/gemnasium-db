title: "OAuth2-Proxy's `--gitlab-group` GitLab Group Authorization config flag stopped
  working in v7.0.0"
description: "The `--gitlab-group` flag for group-based authorization in the GitLab
  provider stopped working in the v7.0.0 release.\n\nRegardless of the flag settings,
  authorization wasn't restricted. Additionally, any authenticated users had whichever
  groups were set in `--gitlab-group` added to the new `X-Forwarded-Groups` header
  to the upstream application.\n\nWhile adding GitLab project based authorization
  support in #630, a bug was introduced where the user session's groups field was
  populated with the `--gitlab-group` config entries instead of pulling the individual
  user's group membership from the GitLab Userinfo endpoint. When the session groups
  where compared against the allowed groups for authorization, they matched improperly
  (since both lists were populated with the same data) so authorization was allowed."
