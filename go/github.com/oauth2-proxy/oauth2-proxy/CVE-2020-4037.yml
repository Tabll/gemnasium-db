title: "URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')"
description: "In OAuth2 Proxy from version 5.1.1 and less than version 6.0.0, users
  can provide a redirect address for the proxy to send the authenticated user to at
  the end of the authentication flow. This is expected to be the original URL that
  the user was trying to access. This redirect URL is checked within the proxy and
  validated before redirecting the user to prevent malicious actors providing redirects
  to potentially harmful sites. This has been fixed in version 6.0.0."
