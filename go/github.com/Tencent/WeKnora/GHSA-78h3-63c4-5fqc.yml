title: "WeKnora has Command Injection in MCP stdio test"
description: "---\n\n- **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**: Arbitrary command execution
  enables file creation/modification, execution of additional payloads, and service
  disruption\n- **Information Disclosure**: Sensitive data exfiltration through reading
  environment variables, configuration files, keys, tokens, and local files\n- **Privilege Escalation/Lateral Movement
  (Environment-Dependent)**: Impact may escalate based on container mounts, network
  policies, and internal service access permissions\n- **Cross-Tenant Boundary Impact**:
  Execution occurs in a shared backend runtime; depending on deployment configuration,
  impact may extend beyond tenant boundaries (**exact scope is uncertain** and varies
  by deployment setup)"
