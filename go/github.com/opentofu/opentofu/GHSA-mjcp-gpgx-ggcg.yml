title: "OpenTofu incorrectly validates excluded subdomain constraint in conjunction
  with TLS certificates containing wildcard SANs"
description: "When OpenTofu is acting as a TLS client authenticating a certificate
  chain provided by a TLS server, an excluded subdomain constraint in a certificate
  chain does not restrict the usage of wildcard [SANs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate#Subject_Alternative_Name_certificate)
  in the leaf certificate.\n\nFor example a constraint that excludes the subdomain
  test.example.com does not prevent a leaf certificate from claiming the SAN *.example.com."
