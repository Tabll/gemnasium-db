title: "OpenTofu has High CPU usage in \"tofu init\" with maliciously-crafted module
  packages in .zip format"
description: "When installing module packages from attacker-controlled sources, `tofu
  init` may cause high CPU usage when encountering maliciously-crafted `.zip` archives
  for either provider or module distribution packages.\n\nThose who depend on modules
  or providers served from untrusted third-party servers may experience denial of
  service due to `tofu init` failing to complete in a timely manner. Other processes
  running on the same computer as OpenTofu may also have their performance degraded
  due to the high CPU usage.\n\nThese vulnerabilities **do not** permit arbitrary
  code execution or allow disclosure of confidential information."
