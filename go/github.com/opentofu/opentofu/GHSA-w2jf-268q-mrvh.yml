title: "OpenTofu affected denials of service in \"tofu init\" with maliciously-crafted
  module package responses"
description: "When installing module packages from attacker-controlled sources, `tofu
  init` may use unbounded memory, cause high CPU usage, or crash when encountering
  maliciously-crafted TLS certificate chains or tar archives.\n\nThose who depend
  on modules or providers served from untrusted third-party servers may experience
  denial of service due to `tofu init` failing to complete successfully. In the case
  of unbounded memory usage or high CPU usage, other processes running on the same
  computer as OpenTofu may also fail or have their performance degraded due to the
  depletion of shared system resources.\n\nThese vulnerabilities **do not** permit
  arbitrary code execution or allow disclosure of confidential information."
