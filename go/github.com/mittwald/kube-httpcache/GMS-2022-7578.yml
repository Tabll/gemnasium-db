description: "A request forgery attack can be performed on Varnish Cache servers that
  have the HTTP/2 protocol turned on. An attacker may introduce characters through
  the HTTP/2 pseudo-headers that are invalid in the context of an HTTP/1 request line,
  causing the Varnish server to produce invalid HTTP/1 requests to the backend. This
  may in turn be used to successfully exploit vulnerabilities in a server behind the
  Varnish server."
