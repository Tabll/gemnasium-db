package_slug: "go/github.com/drakkan/sftpgo/v2"
title: "Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort"
description: "SFTPGo is configurable SFTP server with optional HTTP/S, FTP/S and WebDAV
  support. SFTPGo WebAdmin and WebClient support login using TOTP (Time-based One
  Time Passwords) as a secondary authentication factor. Because TOTPs are often configured
  on mobile devices that can be lost, stolen or damaged, SFTPGo also supports recovery
  codes. These are a set of one time use codes that can be used instead of the TOTP.
  In SFTPGo versions from version 2.2.0 to 2.3.3 recovery codes can be generated before
  enabling two-factor authentication. An attacker who knows the user's password could
  potentially generate some recovery codes and then bypass two-factor authentication
  after it is enabled on the account at a later time. This issue has been fixed in
  version 2.3.4. Recovery codes can now only be generated after enabling two-factor
  authentication and are deleted after disabling it."
