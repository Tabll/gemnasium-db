title: "sftpgo vulnerable to brute force takeover of OpenID Connect session cookies"
description: "The OpenID Connect implementation, in the affected SFTPGo versions,
  allows authenticated users to brute force session cookies and thereby gain access
  to other users' data, since the cookies are generated predictably using the [xid](https://github.com/rs/xid)
  library and are therefore unique but not cryptographically secure."
