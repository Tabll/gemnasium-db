package_slug: "go/github.com/drakkan/sftpgo/v2"
title: "SFTPGo has insufficient sanitization of user provided rsync command"
description: "SFTPGo supports execution of a defined set of commands via SSH. Besides
  a set of default commands some optional commands can be activated, one of them being
  `rsync`: it is disabled in the default configuration and it is limited to the local
  filesystem, it does not work with cloud/remote storage backends.\n\nDue to missing
  sanitization of the client provided `rsync` command, an authenticated remote user
  can use some options of the rsync command to read or write files with the permissions
  of the SFTPGo server process."
