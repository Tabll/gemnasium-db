title: "Validation of `VoteExtensionsEnableHeight` can cause chain halt in Go package
  github.com/cometbft/cometbft"
description: "## Summary\n\nA vulnerability in CometBFT’s validation logic for `VoteExtensionsEnableHeight`
  can result in a chain halt when triggered through a governance parameter change
  proposal on an ABCI2 Application Chain. If a parameter change proposal including
  a `VoteExtensionsEnableHeight` modification is passed, nodes running the affected
  versions may panic, halting the network.\n\nThe CometBFT team addressed this issue
  by improving validation logic for the `VoteExtensionsEnableHeight` to correctly
  handle governance proposals addressing this parameter.\n\n## Next Steps for Impacted
  Parties\n\nIf you are a chain developer with an active network running on CometBFT
  v. 0.38.x, we recommend updating your chain application to v0.38.3 or later of CometBFT
  to patch this issue. \n\nThis issue can be resolved with a “soft patch” to an active
  network, i.e. nodes can be patched and restarted at different times without the
  need for a coordinated upgrade that halts a chain. If this patching methodology
  is used, the risk of a network halt triggered by this issue is mitigated once more
  than 66.7% of voting power on the network has applied the update, which provides
  protection from exploitation while on-chain governance processes for software upgrades
  take place. Once all validator nodes operating a network have been updated, the
  risk of a network halt due to this issue will be fully resolved. \n\nFor more information
  about CometBFT, see https://docs.cometbft.com/. \n\nThis issue was found by Dongsam
