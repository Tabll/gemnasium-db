title: "Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime"
description: "CometBFT is a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) middleware that takes a
  state transition machine and replicates it on many machines. The mempool maintains
  two data structures to keep track of outstanding transactions: a list and a map.\nThese
  two data structures are supposed to be in sync all the time in the sense that the
  map tracks the index (if any) of the transaction in the list. In `v0.37.0`, and
  `v0.37.1`, as well as in `v0.34.28`, and all previous releases of the CometBFT repo2,
  it is possible to have them out of sync. When this happens, the list may contain
  several copies of the same transaction. Because the map tracks a single index, it
  is then no longer possible to remove all the copies of the transaction from the
  list. This happens even if the duplicated transaction is later committed in a block.
  The only way to remove the transaction is by restarting the node.\n\nThe above problem
  can be repeated on and on until a sizable number of transactions are stuck in the
  mempool, in order to try to bring down the target node. The problem is fixed in
  releases `v0.34.29` and `v0.37.2`. Some workarounds are available. Increasing the
  value of `cache_size` in `config.toml` makes it very difficult to effectively attack
  a full node. Not exposing the transaction submission RPC's would mitigate the probability
  of a successful attack, as the attacker would then have to create a modified (byzantine)
  full node to be able to perform the attack via p2p."
