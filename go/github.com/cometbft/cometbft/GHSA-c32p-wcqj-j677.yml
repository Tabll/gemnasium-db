title: "CometBFT has inconsistencies between how commit signatures are verified and
  how block time is derived"
description: "**Name:** CSA-2026-001: Tachyon\n\n**Criticality:** Critical (Catastrophic
  Impact; Possible Likelihood per [ACMv1.2](https://github.com/interchainio/security/blob/main/resources/CLASSIFICATION_MATRIX.md))\n\n**Affected
  versions:** All versions of CometBFT\n\n**Affected users:** Validators and protocols
  relying on block timestamps\n\n\nA consensus-level vulnerability was discovered
  in CometBFT's \"BFT Time\" implementation due to an inconsistency between how commit
  signatures are verified and how block time is derived.\n\nThis breaks a core BFT
  Time guarantee: \"A faulty process cannot arbitrarily increase the Time value.\""
