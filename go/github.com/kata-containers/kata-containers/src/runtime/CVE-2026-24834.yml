package_slug: "go/github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/src/runtime"
title: "Kata Container to Guest micro VM privilege escalation"
description: "An issue in Kata with Cloud Hypervisor allows a user of the container
  to modify the file system used by the Guest micro VM ultimately achieving arbitrary
  code execution as root in said VM. The current understinding is this doesn’t impact
  the security of the Host or of other containers / VMs running on that Host (note
  that arm64 QEMU lacks NVDIMM read-only support: It is believed that until the upstream
  QEMU gains this capability, a guest write could reach the image file)."
