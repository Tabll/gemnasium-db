description: "### Impact\n\nRapidly creating and cancelling streams (HEADERS frame
  immediately followed by RST_STREAM) without bound cause denial of service.\n\nSee
  https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-44487 for details.\n\n### Patches\n\nnghttp2
  v1.57.0 mitigates this vulnerability by default.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf upgrading
  to nghttp2 v1.57.0 is not possible, implement `nghttp2_on_frame_recv_callback`,
  and check and count RST_STREAM frames. If excessive number of RST_STREAM are received,
  then take action, such as dropping connection silently, or call `nghttp2_submit_goaway`
  and gracefully terminate the connection.\n\n### References\n\nThe following commit
  mitigates this vulnerability:\n\n- https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/commit/72b4af6143681f528f1d237b21a9a7aee1738832\n"
