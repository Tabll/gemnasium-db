package_slug: "go/github.com/greenpau/caddy-security"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "All versions of the package github.com/greenpau/caddy-security is vulnerable
  to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) via the Referer header, due to improper input sanitization.
  Although the Referer header is sanitized by escaping some characters that can allow
  XSS (e.g., [&], [<], [>], [\"], [']), it does not account for the attack based on
  the JavaScript URL scheme (e.g., javascript:alert(document.domain)// payload). Exploiting
  this vulnerability may not be trivial, but it could lead to the execution of malicious
  scripts in the context of the target userâ€™s browser, compromising user sessions."
