package_slug: "go/github.com/greenpau/caddy-security"
title: "Use of Insufficiently Random Values"
description: "Versions of the package github.com/greenpau/caddy-security before 1.0.42
  is vulnerable to Insecure Randomness due to using an insecure random number generation
  library which could possibly be predicted via a brute-force search. Attackers could
  use the potentially predictable nonce value used for authentication purposes in
  the OAuth flow to conduct OAuth replay attacks. In addition, insecure randomness
  is used while generating multifactor authentication (MFA) secrets and creating API
  keys in the database package."
