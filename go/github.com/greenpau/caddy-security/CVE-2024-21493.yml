title: "Improper Validation of Array Index"
description: "All versions of the package github.com/greenpau/caddy-security is vulnerable
  to Improper Validation of Array Index when parsing a Caddyfile. Multiple parsing
  functions in the affected library do not validate whether their input values are
  nil before attempting to access elements, which can lead to a panic (index out of
  range). Panics during the parsing of a configuration file may introduce ambiguity
  and vulnerabilities, hindering the correct interpretation and configuration of the
  web server."
