title: "Gin-vue-admin has arbitrary file upload vulnerability caused by path traversal"
description: "Gin-vue-admin <= v2.8.7 has a path traversal vulnerability in the breakpoint
  resume upload functionality. Attacker can upload any files on any directory.\n\nPath
  traversal vulnerabilities occur when a web application accepts user-supplied file
  paths without proper validation, allowing attackers to access or write files outside
  the intended directory. In the breakpoint_continue.go file, the MakeFile function
  accepts a fileName parameter through the /fileUploadAndDownload/breakpointContinueFinish
  API endpoint and directly concatenates it with the base directory path (./fileDir/)
  using os.OpenFile() without any validation for directory traversal sequences (e.g.,
  ../).\n\nNotably, while the related makeFileContent function in the same file properly
  validates the fileName parameter by checking for .. sequences, the MakeFile function
  lacks this security control, indicating an inconsistent security implementation.\n\nAn
  **attacker with file upload privileges (role ID 888 - super administrator)** could
  exploit this vulnerability by:\n\nFirst uploading file chunks through the /fileUploadAndDownload/breakpointContinue
  endpoint (which has proper validation)\n\nThen calling the /fileUploadAndDownload/breakpointContinueFinish
  endpoint with a malicious fileName parameter containing path traversal sequences
  (e.g., ../../../tmp/malicious.txt)\n\nThis could lead to:\nArbitrary file creation,
  application process, Configuration file overwriting, Potential Remote Code Execution......"
