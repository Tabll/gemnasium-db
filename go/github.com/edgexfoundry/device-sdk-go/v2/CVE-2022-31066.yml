package_slug: "go/github.com/edgexfoundry/device-sdk-go/v2"
title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "EdgeX Foundry is an open source project for building a common open framework
  for Internet of Things edge computing. Prior to version 2.1.1, the /api/v2/config
  endpoint exposes message bus credentials to local unauthenticated users. In security-enabled
  mode, message bus credentials are supposed to be kept in the EdgeX secret store
  and require authentication to access. This vulnerability bypasses the access controls
  on message bus credentials when running in security-enabled mode. (No credentials
  are required when running in security-disabled mode.) As a result, attackers could
  intercept data or inject fake data into the EdgeX message bus. Users should upgrade
  to EdgeXFoundry Kamakura release (2.2.0) or to the June 2022 EdgeXFoundry LTS Jakarta
  release (2.1.1) to receive a patch. More information about which go modules, docker
  containers, and snaps contain patches is available in the GitHub Security Advisory.
  There are currently no known workarounds for this issue."
