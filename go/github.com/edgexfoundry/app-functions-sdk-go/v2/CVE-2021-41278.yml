title: "Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm"
description: "Functions SDK for EdgeX is meant to provide all the plumbing necessary
  for developers to get started in processing/transforming/exporting data out of the
  EdgeX IoT platform. The app-functions-sdk exports an “aes” transform that user scripts
  can optionally call to encrypt data in the processing pipeline. No decrypt function
  is provided. Encryption is not enabled by default, but if used, the level of protection
  may be less than the user may expects due to a broken implementation. Version v2.1.0
  (EdgeX Foundry Jakarta release) of app-functions-sdk-go/v2 deprecates the “aes”
  transform and provides an improved “aes256” transform in its place. The broken implementation
  will remain in a deprecated state until it is removed in the next EdgeX major release
  to avoid breakage of existing software that depends on the broken implementation.
  As the broken transform is a library function that is not invoked by default, users
  who do not use the AES transform in their processing pipelines are unaffected. Those
  that are affected are urged to upgrade to the Jakarta EdgeX release and modify processing
  pipelines to use the new \"aes256\" transform."
