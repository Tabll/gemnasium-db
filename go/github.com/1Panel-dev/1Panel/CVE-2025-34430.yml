title: "1Panel contains a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the panel
  name management functionality"
description: "1Panel versions 1.10.33 through 2.0.15 contain a cross-site request
  forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the panel name management functionality. The affected
  endpoint does not implement CSRF defenses such as anti-CSRF tokens or Origin/Referer
  validation. An attacker can craft a malicious webpage that submits a panel-name
  change request; if a victim visits the page while authenticated, the browser includes
  valid session cookies and the request succeeds. This allows a remote attacker to
  change the victim’s panel name to an arbitrary value without consent."
