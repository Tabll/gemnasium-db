title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "1Panel is an open source Linux server operation and maintenance management
  panel. In version 1.4.3, arbitrary file reads allow an attacker to read arbitrary
  important configuration files on the server. In the `api/v1/file.go` file, there
  is a function called `LoadFromFile`, which directly reads the file by obtaining
  the requested path `parameter[path]`. The request parameters are not filtered, resulting
  in a background arbitrary file reading vulnerability. Version 1.5.0 has a patch
  for this issue."
