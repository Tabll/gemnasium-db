title: "1Panel – CAPTCHA Bypass via Client-Controlled Flag "
description: "A CAPTCHA bypass vulnerability in the 1Panel authentication API allows
  an unauthenticated attacker to disable CAPTCHA verification by abusing a client-controlled
  parameter. Because the server previously trusted this value without proper validation,
  CAPTCHA protections could be bypassed, enabling automated login attempts and significantly
  increasing the risk of account takeover (ATO)."
