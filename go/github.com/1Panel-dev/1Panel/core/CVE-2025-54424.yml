package_slug: "go/github.com/1Panel-dev/1Panel/core"
title: "1Panel agent certificate verification bypass leading to arbitrary command
  execution"
description: "- First, we introduce the concepts of 1panel v2 Core and Agent. After
  the new version is released, 1panel adds the node management function, which allows
  you to control other hosts by adding nodes.\n- The HTTPS protocol used for communication
  between the Core and Agent sides did not fully verify the authenticity of the certificate
  during certificate verification, resulting in unauthorized interfaces. The presence
  of a large number of command execution or high-privilege interfaces in the 1panel
  led to RCE.\n\n![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebd0b388-d6c0-4678-98ee-47646e69ebe9)"
