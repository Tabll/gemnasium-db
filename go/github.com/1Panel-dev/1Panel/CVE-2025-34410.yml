title: "1Panel contains a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the Change
  Username functionality"
description: "1Panel versions 1.10.33 - 2.0.15 contain a cross-site request forgery
  (CSRF) vulnerability in the Change Username functionality available from the settings
  panel (/settings/panel). The endpoint does not implement CSRF protections such as
  anti-CSRF tokens or Origin/Referer validation. An attacker can craft a malicious
  webpage that submits a username-change request; when a victim visits the page while
  authenticated, the browser includes valid session cookies and the request succeeds.
  This allows an attacker to change the victim’s 1Panel username without consent.
  After the change, the victim is logged out and unable to log in with the previous
  username, resulting in account lockout and denial of service."
