title: "Go SDK for CloudEvents's use of WithRoundTripper to create a Client leaks
  credentials"
description: "### Impact\n_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\nUsing
  cloudevents.WithRoundTripper to create a cloudevents.Client with an authenticated
  http.RoundTripper causes the go-sdk to leak credentials to arbitrary endpoints.\n\nThe
  relevant code is [here](https://github.com/cloudevents/sdk-go/blob/67e389964131d55d65cd14b4eb32d57a47312695/v2/protocol/http/protocol.go#L104-L110)
  (also inline, emphasis added):\n\n<pre>if p.Client == nil {\n  p.Client = **http.DefaultClient**\n}\n\nif
  p.roundTripper != nil {\n  p.Client.**Transport = p.roundTripper**\n}\n</pre>\n\nWhen
  the transport is populated with an authenticated transport such as:\n- [oauth2.Transport](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/oauth2#Transport)\n-
  [idtoken.NewClient(...).Transport](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/api/idtoken#NewClient)\n\n...
  then http.DefaultClient is modified with the authenticated transport and will start
  to send Authorization tokens to\n**any endpoint** it is used to contact!\n\nFound
  and patched by: @tcnghia and @mattmoor\n\n### Patches\nv.2.15.2\n"
