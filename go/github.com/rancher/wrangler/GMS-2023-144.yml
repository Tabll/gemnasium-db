title: "Denial of service (DoS) when processing Git credentials"
description: "### Impact\n\nA denial of services (DoS) vulnerability was discovered
  in Wrangler Git package affecting versions up to and including `v1.0.0`.\n\nSpecially
  crafted Git credentials can result in a denial of service (DoS) attack on an application
  that uses Wrangler due to the exhaustion of the available memory and CPU resources.
  This is caused by a lack of input validation of Git credentials before they are
  used, which may lead to a denial of service in some cases. This issue can be triggered
  when accessing both private and public Git repositories. \n\n### Workarounds\n\nA
  workaround is to sanitize input passed to the Git package to remove potential unsafe
  and ambiguous characters. Otherwise, the best course of action is to update to a
  patched Wrangler version.\n\n### Patches\n\nPatched versions include `v1.0.1` and
  later and the backported tags - `v0.7.4-security1`, `v0.8.5-security1` and `v0.8.11`.\n\n###
