package_slug: "go/github.com/rancher/stev"
title: "Steve doesn’t verify a server’s certificate and is susceptible to man-in-the-middle
  (MitM) attacks"
description: "A vulnerability has been identified in Steve where by default it was
  using an insecure option that did not validate the certificate presented by the
  remote server while performing a TLS connection. This could allow the execution
  of a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack against services using Steve.\n\nFor example,
  Rancher relies on Steve as a dependency for its user interface (UI) to proxy requests
  to Kubernetes clusters. Users who have the permission to create a service in Rancher’s
  local cluster can take over Rancher’s UI and display their own UI to gather sensitive
  information. This is only possible when the setting `ui-offline-preferred` is manually
  set to `remote` (by default Rancher sets it to `dynamic`). This enables further
  attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS), or tampering the UI to collect passwords
  from other users etc.\n\nPlease consult the associated  [MITRE ATT&CK - Technique
  - Adversary-in-the-Middle](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/) for further
  information about this category of attack."
