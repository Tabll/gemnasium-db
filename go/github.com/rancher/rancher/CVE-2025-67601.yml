title: "Rancher CLI skips TLS verification on Rancher CLI login command"
description: "A vulnerability has been identified within Rancher Manager, where using
  self-signed CA certificates and passing the `-skip-verify` flag to the Rancher CLI
  login command without also passing the `–cacert` flag results in the CLI attempting
  to fetch CA certificates stored in Rancher’s setting cacerts. This does not apply
  to any other commands and only applies to the login command if the `–cacert` flag
  was not provided.\n\nAn attacker with network-level access between the Rancher CLI
  and Rancher Manager could interfere with the TLS handshake to return a CA they control,
  despite the use of the `--skip-verify` flag. This may be abused to bypass TLS as
  a security control. Attackers can also see basic authentication headers in a Man-in-the-Middle
  due to the lack of TLS enforcement.\n\nPlease consult the associated [MITRE ATT&CK
  - Technique - Man-in-the-Middle](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/) for
  further information about this category of attack."
