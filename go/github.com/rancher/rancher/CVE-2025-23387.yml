title: "Rancher's SAML-based login via CLI can be denied by unauthenticated users"
description: "A vulnerability has been identified within Rancher where it is possible
  for an unauthenticated user to list all CLI authentication tokens and delete them
  before the CLI is able to get the token value. This effectively prevents users from
  logging in via the CLI when using rancher token as the execution command (instead
  of the token directly being in the kubeconfig).\n\nNote that this token is not the
  kubeconfig token and if an attacker is able to intercept it they can't use it to
  impersonate a real user since it is encrypted.\n\nThis happens because for SAML-based
  authentication providers, the login flow from the CLI works by generating a link
  to be pasted in the browser, and then polling every 10 seconds for the `/v3-public/authTokens/<token
  name>` endpoint.  The `<token name>` is randomly generated by the CLI. Once the
  login flow succeeds, Rancher creates an auth token (with an encrypted token value).
  The CLI then deletes the authToken.\n\n\nRancher deployments using only the local
  authentication provider, or non-SAML-based authentication providers, are not impacted
  by this vulnerability. SAML-based users not using the CLI are also not impacted.\n\n\nPlease
  consult the associated  [MITRE ATT&CK - Technique - Account Access Removal](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1531/)
  for further information about this category of attack."
