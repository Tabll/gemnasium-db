title: "Rancher sends sensitive information to external services through the `/meta/proxy`
  endpoint"
description: "A vulnerability has been identified within Rancher Manager whereby `Impersonate-Extra-*`
  headers are being sent to an external entity, for example `amazonaws.com`, via the
  `/meta/proxy` Rancher endpoint. These headers may contain identifiable and/or sensitive
  information e.g. email addresses.\n\nIf the authentication provider is configured
  to have email or other sensitive and/or identifiable information as part of the
  username and principal ID then when a new cloud credential is being created in Rancher
  Manager this information is sent to an external entity such as `amazonaws.com`,
  in case of an AWS cloud credentials, in `Impersonate-Extra-Username` and/or `Impersonate-Extra-Principalid`
  headers. Please note that neither password, password hashes or Rancherâ€™s related
  authentication tokens are leaked in those requests.\n\nThe entities to which such
  information is sent to are limited by the allowlisted domains specified in `nodedrivers.management.cattle.io`
  objects.\n\nFor example, the Amazon EC2 node driver contains the following allowlisted
  domains:\n\n- `iam.amazonaws.com`\n- `iam.us-gov.amazonaws.com`\n- `iam.%.amazonaws.com.cn`\n-
  `iam.global.api.aws`\n- `ec2.%.amazonaws.com`\n- `ec2.%.amazonaws.com.cn`\n- `ec2.%.api.aws`\n-
  `eks.%.amazonaws.com`\n- `eks.%.amazonaws.com.cn`\n- `eks.%.api.aws`\n- `kms.%.amazonaws.com`\n-
  `kms.%.amazonaws.com.cn`\n- `kms.%.api.aws`\n\nWhile the DigitalOcean driver contains
  the following allowlisted domain:\n\n- `api.digitalocean.com`"
