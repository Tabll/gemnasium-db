package_slug: "go/github.com/rancher/rancher"
title: "Rancher permissions on 'namespaces' in any API group grants 'edit' permissions
  on namespaces in 'core'"
description: "### Impact\nA vulnerability has been identified when granting a `create`
  or `*` **global role** for a resource type of \"namespaces\"; no matter the API
  group, the subject will receive `*` permissions for core namespaces. This can lead
  to someone being capable of accessing, creating, updating, or deleting a namespace
  in the project. This includes reading or updating a namespace in the project so
  that it is available in other projects in which the user has the \"manage-namespaces\"
  permission or updating another namespace in which the user has normal \"update\"
  permissions to be moved into the project.\n\nThe expected behavior is to not be
  able to create, update, or delete a namespace in the project or move another namespace
  into the project since the user does not have any permissions on namespaces in the
  core API group.\n\nMoving a namespace to another project could lead to leakage of
  secrets, in case the targeted project has secrets. And also can lead to the namespace
  being able to abuse the resource quotas of the targeted project.\n\n### Patches\nPatched
  versions include releases `2.6.14`, `2.7.10` and `2.8.2`.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere
  is no direct mitigation besides updating Rancher to a patched version.\n\n### References\nIf
  you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n- Reach out to the [SUSE
  Rancher Security team](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/policy) for security-related
  inquiries.\n- Open an issue in the [Rancher](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/new/choose)
  repository.\n- Verify with our [support matrix](https://www.suse.com/suse-rancher/support-matrix/all-supported-versions/)
