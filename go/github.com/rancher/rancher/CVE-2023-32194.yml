title: "Rancher permissions on 'namespaces' in any API group grants 'edit' permissions
  on namespaces in 'core'"
description: "A vulnerability has been identified when granting a `create` or `*`
  **global role** for a resource type of \"namespaces\"; no matter the API group,
  the subject will receive `*` permissions for core namespaces. This can lead to someone
  being capable of accessing, creating, updating, or deleting a namespace in the project.
  This includes reading or updating a namespace in the project so that it is available
  in other projects in which the user has the \"manage-namespaces\" permission or
  updating another namespace in which the user has normal \"update\" permissions to
  be moved into the project.\n\nThe expected behavior is to not be able to create,
  update, or delete a namespace in the project or move another namespace into the
  project since the user doesn't have any permissions on namespaces in the core API
  group.\n\nMoving a namespace to another project could lead to leakage of secrets,
  in case the targeted project has secrets. And also can lead to the namespace being
  able to abuse the resource quotas of the targeted project."
