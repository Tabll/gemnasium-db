title: "Rancher UI has multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issues"
description: "Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities have been identified
  in the Rancher UI.\nCross-Site scripting allows a malicious user to inject code
  that is executed within another user's browser, allowing the attacker to steal sensitive
  information, manipulate web content, or perform other malicious activities on behalf
  of the victims. This could result in a user with write access to the affected areas
  being able to act on behalf of an administrator, once an administrator opens the
  affected web page.\n\nThe affected areas include the Projects/Namespaces and Auth
  Provider sections. The attacker needs to be authenticated and have write access
  to those features in order to exploit the vulnerabilities. Some of the permissions
  (roles) required are:\n\n- Project Owner.\n- Restricted Admin.\n- Configure Authentication.\n-
  Administrator.\n- Custom RBAC Role that provides write access on Projects or External
  Authentication Providers.\n\nFor users that suspect this vulnerability may have
  targeted their Rancher instance, we recommend rotating all API Keys and Kubeconfig
  tokens.\n\nIt's also advised to review logs and possibly rotate credentials stored
  as secrets in Rancher and downstream cluster, if you believe that users' credentials
  to access Rancher and its clusters might have been compromised."
