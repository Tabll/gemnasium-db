title: "Missing Authorization"
description: "In Rancher 1 and 2 through 2.2.3, unprivileged users (if allowed to
  deploy nodes) can gain admin access to the Rancher management plane because node
  driver options intentionally allow posting certain data to the cloud. The problem
  is that a user could choose to post a sensitive file such as /root/.kube/config
  or /var/lib/rancher/management-state/cred/kubeconfig-system.yaml."
