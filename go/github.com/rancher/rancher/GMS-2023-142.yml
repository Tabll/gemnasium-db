title: "Plaintext storage of sensitive data in Rancher API and cluster.management.cattle.io
  objects"
description: "This issue affects Rancher versions from 2.5.0 up to and
  including 2.5.16, from 2.6.0 up to and including 2.6.9 and 2.7.0. It was discovered
  that the security advisory CVE-2021-36782 (GHSA-g7j7-h4q8-8w2f), previously released
  by Rancher, missed addressing some sensitive fields, secret tokens, encryption keys,
  and SSH keys that were still being stored in plaintext directly on Kubernetes objects
  like `Clusters`."
