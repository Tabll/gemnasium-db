package_slug: "go/github.com/rancher/rancher"
title: "Rancher Helm Applications may have sensitive values leaked"
description: "A vulnerability has been identified within Rancher Manager whereby applications
  installed via Rancher Manager Apps Catalog store their Helm values directly into
  the `Apps` Custom Resource Definition, resulting in any users with `GET` access
  to it to be able to read any sensitive information that are contained within the
  Appsâ€™ values. Additionally, the same information leaks into auditing logs when the
  audit level is set to equal or above 2.\n\nApplication charts without sensitive
  data are not affected by this vulnerability.\nThis vulnerability impacts any Helm
  applications installed on a Rancher Manager cluster, regardless of it being installed
  via the Marketplace or using the helm cli.\n\nPlease consult the associated [MITRE
  ATT&CK - Technique - Exploitation for Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1068/)
  for further information about this category of attack."
