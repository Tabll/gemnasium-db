title: "Rancher 'Audit Log' leaks sensitive information"
description: "A vulnerability has been identified which may lead to sensitive data
  being leaked into Rancher's audit logs. [Rancher Audit Logging](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/how-to-guides/advanced-user-guides/enable-api-audit-log)
  is an opt-in feature, only deployments that have it enabled and have [AUDIT_LEVEL](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/how-to-guides/advanced-user-guides/enable-api-audit-log#audit-log-levels)
  set to `1 or above` are impacted by this issue.\n\nThe leaks might be caught in
  the audit logs upon these actions:\n\n- Creating cloud credentials or new authentication
  providers. It is crucial to note that **all** [authentication providers](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/pages-for-subheaders/authentication-config#external-vs-local-authentication)
  (such as AzureAD) and [cloud providers](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/pages-for-subheaders/set-up-cloud-providers)
  (such as Google) are impacted.\n- Downloading a kubeconfig file from a downstream
  or a local cluster.\n- Logging in/out from Rancher.\n\nThe affected data may include
  the following:\n\n- HTTP headers\n\nField | Location\n-- | --\nX-Api-Auth-Header
  | Request header\nX-Api-Set-Cookie-Header | Response header\nX-Amz-Security-Token
  | Request header\ncredentials | Request body\napplicationSecret | Request Body\noauthCredential
  | Request Body\nserviceAccountCredential | Request Body\nspKey | Request Body\nspCert
  | Request body\nspCert | Response body\ncertificate | Request body\nprivateKey |
  Request body\n\n- API Server calls returning `Secret` objects (including sub-types,
  such as `kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson`).\n- Raw command lines used by agents to
  connect to the Rancher server which expose sensitive information (e.g. `register
  ... --token abc`).\n- `Kubeconfig` contents when the 'Download KubeConfig' feature
  is used in the Rancher UI.\n\nThe patched versions will redact the sensitive data,
  replacing it with `[redacted]`, making it safer for consumption. It is recommended
  that static secrets are rotated after the system is patched, to limit the potential
  impact of sensitive data being misused due to this vulnerability.\n\n**Note:**\n1.
  The severity of the vulnerability is intricately tied to the logging strategy employed.
  If logs are kept locally (default configuration), the impact is contained within
  the system, limiting the exposure.\nHowever, when logs are shipped to an external
  endpoint, the vulnerability's severity might increase, as resistance against leaks
  is contingent on the security measures implemented at the external log collector
  level.\n2. The final impact severity for confidentiality, integrity and availability
  is dependent on the permissions that the leaked credentials have on their own services."
