package_slug: "go/github.com/rancher/rancher"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "Rancher 2 through 2.2.4 is vulnerable to a Cross-Site Websocket Hijacking
  attack that allows an exploiter to gain access to clusters managed by Rancher. The
  attack requires a victim to be logged into a Rancher server, and then to access
  a third-party site hosted by the exploiter. Once that is accomplished, the exploiter
  is able to execute commands against the cluster's Kubernetes API with the permissions
  and identity of the victim."
