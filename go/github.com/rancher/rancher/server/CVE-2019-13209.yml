identifier: "CVE-2019-13209"
package_slug: "go/github.com/rancher/rancher/server"
title: "Cross-site Scripting"
description: "Rancher is vulnerable to a Cross-Site Websocket Hijacking attack that
  allows an exploiter to gain access to clusters managed by Rancher. The attack requires
  a victim to be logged into a Rancher server, and then to access a third-party site
  hosted by the exploiter. Once that is accomplished, the exploiter is able to execute
  commands against the cluster's Kubernetes API with the permissions and identity
  of the victim."
