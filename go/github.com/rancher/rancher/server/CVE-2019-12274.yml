package_slug: "go/github.com/rancher/rancher/server"
title: "Improper Access Controls"
description: "In Rancher, unprivileged users (if allowed to deploy nodes) can gain
  admin access to the Rancher management plane because node driver options intentionally
  allow posting certain data to the cloud. The problem is that a user could choose
  to post a sensitive file such as `/root/.kube/config` or `/var/lib/rancher/management-state/cred/kubeconfig-system.yaml`."
