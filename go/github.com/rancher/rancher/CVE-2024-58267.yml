title: "Rancher CLI SAML authentication is vulnerable to phishing attacks"
description: "A vulnerability has been identified within Rancher Manager whereby the
  SAML authentication from the Rancher CLI  tool is vulnerable to phishing attacks.
  The custom authentication protocol for SAML-based providers can be abused to steal
  Rancher’s authentication tokens.\n\nRancher Manager deployments without SAML authentication
  enabled are not affected by this vulnerability.\n\nAn attacker can generate a phishing
  SAML login URL which contains a `publicKey` and `requestId` controlled by the attacker.
  The attacker can then give the link to another user (eg: admin) and if the victim
  goes to the link unsuspectingly, they might not notice the bad parameters in the
  URL. The user will be prompted to login and might believe that its session has ended
  so they need to re-login. By clicking on the link, they will be logged in and an
  encrypted token will be created with the attacker's public key. The attacker can
  then decrypt the victim’s Rancher token, enabling the attack\n\nPlease consult the
  associated [MITRE ATTACK Techniques - Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0004/)
  for further information about this category of attack."
