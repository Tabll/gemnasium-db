title: "Rancher Recreates Default User With Known Password Despite Deletion"
description: "An issue was discovered that affects the following versions of Rancher:
  v2.0.0 through v2.0.13, v2.1.0 through v2.1.8, and v2.2.0 through 2.2.1. When Rancher
  starts for the first time, it creates a default admin user with a well-known password.
  After initial setup, the Rancher administrator may choose to delete this default
  admin user. If Rancher is restarted, the default admin user will be recreated with
  the well-known default password. An attacker could exploit this by logging in with
  the default admin credentials. This can be mitigated by deactivating the default
  admin user rather than completing deleting them."
