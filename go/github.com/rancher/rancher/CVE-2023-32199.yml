title: "Rancher user retains access to clusters despite Global Role removal"
description: "A vulnerability has been identified within Rancher Manager, where after
  removing a custom GlobalRole that gives administrative access or the corresponding
  binding, the user still retains access to clusters.\nThis only affects custom Global
  Roles that:\n- Have a `*` on `*` in `*` rule for resources\n- Have a `*` on `*`
  rule for non-resource URLs\n\nFor example\n```yaml\napiVersion: management.cattle.io/v3\nkind:
  GlobalRole\nmetadata:\nname: custom-admin\nrules:\n- apiGroups:\n- '*'\nresources:\n-
  '*'\nverbs:\n- '*'\n- nonResourceURLs:\n- '*'\nverbs:\n- '*'\n```\n\nSpecifically:\n-
  When a user is bound to a custom admin `GlobalRole`, a corresponding `ClusterRoleBinding`
  is created on all clusters that binds them to the cluster-admin `ClusterRole`.\n-
  When such a `GlobalRole` or the `GlobalRoleBinding` (e.g., when the user is unassigned
  from this role in UI) is deleted, the `ClusterRoleBinding` that binds them to the
  cluster-admin ClusterRole stays behind.\n\nThis issue allows a user to continue
  having access to clusters after they have been unassigned from the custom admin
  global role or the role has been deleted.\n\nPlease consult the associated  [MITRE
  ATT&CK - Technique - Account Access Removal](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1531/)
  for further information about this category of attack."
