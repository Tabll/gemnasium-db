title: "Rancher users who can create Projects can gain access to arbitrary projects"
description: "A vulnerability has been identified within Rancher where a user with
  the ability to create a project, on a certain cluster, can create a project with
  the same name as an existing project in a different cluster. This results in the
  user gaining access to the other project in the different cluster, resulting in
  a privilege escalation. This happens because the namespace used on the local cluster
  to store related resources (PRTBs and secrets) is the name of the project.\n\nPlease
  consult the associated  [MITRE ATT&CK - Technique - Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0004/)
  for further information about this category of attack."
