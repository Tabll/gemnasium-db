title: "Rancher update on users can deny the service to the admin"
description: "A vulnerability has been identified within Rancher Manager where a missing
  server-side validation on the `.username` field in Rancher can allow users with
  update permissions on other User resources to cause denial of access for targeted
  accounts. Specifically:\n\n- Username takeover: A user with permission to update
  another user’s resource can set its `.username` to \"admin\", preventing both the
  legitimate admin and the affected user from logging in, as Rancher enforces uniqueness
  at login time.\n- Account lockout: A user with update permissions on the admin account
  can change the admin’s username, effectively blocking administrative access to the
  Rancher UI.\n\nThis issue enables a malicious or compromised account with elevated
  update privileges on User resources to disrupt platform administration and user
  authentication."
