package_slug: "go/github.com/rancher/rancher"
title: "Rancher's Failure to delete orphaned role bindings does not revoke project
  level access from group based authentication"
description: "This vulnerability only affects customers using group based authentication
  in Rancher versions up to and including 2.4.17, 2.5.11 and 2.6.2.\n\nWhen removing
  a Project Role associated to a group from a project, the bindings that grant access
  to cluster scoped resources for those subjects do not get deleted. This happens
  due to an incomplete authorization logic check. A user who is a member of an affected
  group with authenticated access to Rancher could use this to access resources they
  should no longer have access to. The exposure level will depend on the original
  permission level granted to the affected project role."
