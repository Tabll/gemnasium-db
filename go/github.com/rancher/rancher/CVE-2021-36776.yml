package_slug: "go/github.com/rancher/rancher"
title: "Rancher's Steve API Component Improper authorization check allows privilege
  escalation"
description: "A flaw discovered in Rancher versions from 2.5.0 up to and including
  2.5.9 allows an authenticated user to impersonate any user on a cluster through
  the Steve API proxy, without requiring knowledge of the impersonated user's credentials.
  This is due to the Steve API proxy not dropping the impersonation header before
  sending the request to the Kubernetes API. A malicious user with authenticated access
  to Rancher could use this to impersonate another user with administrator access
  in Rancher, receiving, then, administrator level access in the cluster."
