package_slug: "go/github.com/rancher/fleet"
title: "Fleet doesn’t validate a server’s certificate when connecting through SSH"
description: "A vulnerability has been identified within Fleet where, by default,
  Fleet will automatically trust a remote server’s certificate when connecting through
  SSH if the certificate isn’t set in the `known_hosts` file. This could allow the
  execution of a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack against Fleet. In case the server
  that is being connected to has a trusted entry in the known_hosts file, then Fleet
  will correctly check the authenticity of the presented certificate.\n\nPlease consult
  the associated  [MITRE ATT&CK - Technique - Adversary-in-the-Middle](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/)
  for further information about this category of attack."
