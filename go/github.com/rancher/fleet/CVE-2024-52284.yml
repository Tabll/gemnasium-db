title: "Rancher Fleet Helm Values are stored inside BundleDeployment in plain text"
description: "A vulnerability has been identified when using Fleet to manage Helm
  charts where sensitive information is passed through `BundleDeployment.Spec.Options.Helm.Values`
  may be stored in plain text. This can result in:\n1. Unauthorized disclosure of
  sensitive data: Any user with `GET` or `LIST` permissions on `BundleDeployment`
  resources could retrieve Helm values containing credentials or other secrets.\n2.
  Lack of encryption at rest: `BundleDeployment` is not configured for Kubernetes
  encryption at rest by default, causing sensitive values to remain unencrypted within
  the cluster datastore.\n\nThis behavior differs from Helm v3’s default approach,
  where chart state — including values — is stored in Kubernetes secrets, benefiting
  from built-in protection mechanisms. In affected scenarios, credentials and other
  sensitive information are exposed both at rest and in responses to API calls.\n\nPlease
  consult the associated  [MITRE ATT&CK - Technique - Credentials from Password Stores](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/)
  for further information about this category of attack.\n\nFor the exposure of credentials
  not related to Rancher, the final impact severity for confidentiality, integrity,
  and availability is dependent on the permissions that the leaked credentials have
  on their own services.\nIt is recommended to review the potentially exposed sensitive
  data in this scenario and change secrets, tokens, and passwords as necessary."
