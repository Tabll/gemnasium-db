title: "Import token permissions checking not enforced"
description: "The NATS server provides for Subjects which are namespaced by Account;
  all Subjects are supposed to be private to an account, with an `Export/Import` system
  used to grant cross-account access to some Subjects. Some Exports are public, such
  that anyone can import the relevant subjects, and some Exports are private, such
  that the Import requires a token JWT to prove permission. The JWT library's validation
  of the bindings in the `Import Token` incorrectly warned on mismatches, instead
  of outright rejecting the token. As a result, any account can take an Import token
  used by any other account and re-use it for themselves because the binding to the
  importing account is not rejected, and use it to import any Subject from the Exporting
  account, not just the Subject referenced in the Import Token. The NATS account-server
  system treats account JWTs as semi-public information, such that an attacker can
  easily enumerate all account JWTs and retrieve all Import Tokens from those account
  JWTs."
