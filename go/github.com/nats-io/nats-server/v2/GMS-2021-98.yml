title: "Nil dereference in NATS JWT, DoS of nats-server"
description: "(This advisory is canonically <https://advisories.nats.io/CVE/CVE-2020-26521.txt>)\n\n##
  Problem Description\n\nThe NATS account system has an Operator trusted by the servers,
  which signs Accounts, and each Account can then create and sign Users within their
  account.  The Operator should be able to safely issue Accounts to other entities
  which it does not fully trust.\n\nA malicious Account could create and sign a User
  JWT with a state not created by the normal tooling, such that decoding by the NATS
  JWT library (written in Go) would attempt a nil dereference, aborting execution.\n\nThe
  NATS Server is known to be impacted by this.\n\n\n## Affected versions\n\n#### JWT
  library\n\n * all versions prior to 1.1.0\n\n#### NATS Server\n\n * Version 2 prior
  to 2.1.9\n\n\n## Impact\n\n#### JWT library\n\n * Programs would nil dereference
  and panic, aborting execution by default.\n\n#### NATS server\n\n * Denial of Service
  caused by process termination\n\n\n## Workaround\n\nIf your NATS servers do not
  trust any accounts which are managed by untrusted entities, then malformed User
  credentials are unlikely to be encountered.\n\n\n## Solution\n\nUpgrade the JWT
  dependency in any application using it.\n\nUpgrade the NATS server if using NATS
  Accounts."
