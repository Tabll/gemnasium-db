title: "Incorrect handling of credential expiry by NATS Server"
description: "(This advisory is canonically https://advisories.nats.io/CVE/CVE-2020-26892.txt
  )\n\n## Problem Description\n\nNATS nats-server through 2020-10-07 has Incorrect
  Access Control because of how expired credentials are handled.\n\nThe NATS accounts
  system has expiration timestamps on credentials; the <https://github.com/nats-io/jwt>
  library had an API which encouraged misuse and an `IsRevoked()` method which misused
  its own API.\n\nA new `IsClaimRevoked()` method has correct handling and the nats-server
  has been updated to use this.  The old `IsRevoked()` method now always returns true
  and other client code will have to be updated to avoid calling it.\n\nThe CVE identifier
  should cover any application using the old JWT API, where the nats-server is one
  of those applications.\n\n\n## Affected versions\n\n#### JWT library\n\n * all versions
  prior to 1.1.0\n * fixed after nats-io/jwt PR 103 landed (2020-10-06)\n\n#### NATS
  Server\n\n * Version 2 prior to 2.1.9\n   + 2.0.0 through and including 2.1.8 are
  vulnerable.\n * fixed with nats-io/nats-server PRs 1632, 1635, 1645\n\n\n## Impact\n\nTime-based
  credential expiry did not work.\n\n\n## Workaround\n\nHave credentials which only
  expire after fixes can be deployed.\n\n\n## Solution\n\nUpgrade the JWT dependency
  in any application using it.\n\nUpgrade the NATS server if using NATS Accounts."
