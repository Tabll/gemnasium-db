title: "NATS Server may fail to authorize certain Jetstream admin APIs"
description: "nats-server did not include authorization checks on 4 separate admin-level
  JetStream APIs: account purge, server remove,  account stream move, and  account
  stream cancel-move.\n\nIn all cases, APIs are not properly restricted to system-account
  users. Instead, _any_ authorized user can execute the APIs, including across account
  boundaries, as long as the current user merely has permission to publish on `$JS.>`.\n\nOnly
  the first seems to be of highest severity. All are included in this single report
  as they seem likely to have the same underlying root cause.\n\nReproduction of the
  `ACCOUNT.PURGE` case is below. The others are like it."
