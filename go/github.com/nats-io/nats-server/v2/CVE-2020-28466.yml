package_slug: "go/github.com/nats-io/nats-server/v2"
title: "Denial of service in github.com/nats-io/nats-server/server"
description: "This affects all versions of package github.com/nats-io/nats-server/server.
  Untrusted accounts are able to crash the server using configs that represent a service
  export/import cycles. Disclaimer from the maintainers: Running a NATS service which
  is exposed to untrusted users presents a heightened risk. Any remote execution flaw
  or equivalent seriousness, or denial-of-service by unauthenticated users, will lead
  to prompt releases by the NATS maintainers. Fixes for denial of service issues with
  no threat of remote execution, when limited to account holders, are likely to just
  be committed to the main development branch with no special attention. Those who
  are running such services are encouraged to build regularly from git."
