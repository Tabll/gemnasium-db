title: "github.com/gorilla/csrf improperly validates TrustedOrigins allowing CSRF
  attacks"
description: "Hosts listed in TrustedOrigins implicitly allow requests from the corresponding
  HTTP origins, allowing network MitMs to perform CSRF attacks.\n\nAfter the CVE-2025-24358
  fix, a network attacker that places a form at http://example.com can't get it to
  submit to https://example.com because the Origin header is checked with sameOrigin
  against a synthetic URL.\n\nHowever, if a host is added to TrustedOrigins, both
  its HTTP and HTTPS origins will be allowed, because the schema of the synthetic
  URL is ignored and only the host is checked. For example, if an application is hosted
  on https://example.com and adds example.net to TrustedOrigins, a network attacker
  can serve a form at http://example.net to perform the attack.\n\nApplications should
  migrate to net/http.CrossOriginProtection, introduced in Go 1.25. If that is not
  an option, a backport is available as a module at filippo.io/csrf, and a drop-in
  replacement for the github.com/gorilla/csrf API is available at filippo.io/csrf/gorilla."
