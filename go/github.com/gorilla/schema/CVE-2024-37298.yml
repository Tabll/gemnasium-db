title: "Potential memory exhaustion attack due to sparse slice deserialization"
description: "Any use of `schema.Decoder.Decode()` on a struct with arrays of other
  structs could be vulnerable to this memory exhaustion vulnerability. There seems
  to be no possible solution that a developer using this library can do to disable
  this behaviour without fixing it in this project, so all uses of Decode that fall
  under this umbrella are affected. A fix that doesn't require a major change may
  also be harder to find, since it could break compatibility with some other intended
  use-cases."
