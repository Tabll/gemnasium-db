title: "gosaml2 vulnerable to Denial Of Service Via Deflate Decompression Bomb"
description: "### Impact\nSAML Service Providers using this library for SAML authentication
  support are likely susceptible to Denial of Service attacks. A bug in this library
  enables attackers to craft a `deflate`-compressed request which will consume significantly
  more memory during processing than the size of the original request. This may eventually
  lead to memory exhaustion and the process being killed.\n\n### Mitigation\nThe maximum
  compression ratio achievable with `deflate` is 1032:1, so by limiting the size of
  bodies passed to gosaml2, limiting the rate and concurrency of calls, and ensuring
  that lots of memory is available to the process it _may_ be possible to help Go's
  garbage collector \"keep up\".\n\nImplementors are encouraged not to rely on this.\n\n###
