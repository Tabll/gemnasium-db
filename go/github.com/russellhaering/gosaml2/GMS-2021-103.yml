title: "Signature Validation Bypass"
description: "### Impact\nGiven a valid SAML Response, an attacker can potentially
  modify the document, bypassing signature validation in order to pass off the altered
  document as a signed one.\n\nThis enables a variety of attacks, including users
  accessing accounts other than the one to which they authenticated in the identity
  provider, or full authentication bypass if an external attacker can obtain an expired,
  signed SAML Response.\n\n### Patches\nA patch is available, users of gosaml2 should
  upgrade to v0.5.0 or higher.\n\n### References\nSee the [underlying advisory on
  goxmldsig](https://github.com/russellhaering/goxmldsig/security/advisories/GHSA-q547-gmf8-8jr7)
  for more details."
