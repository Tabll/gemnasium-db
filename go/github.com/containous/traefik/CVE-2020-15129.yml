package_slug: "go/github.com/containous/traefik"
title: "URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')"
description: "In Traefik before versions 1.7.26, 2.2.8, and 2.3.0-rc3, there exists
  a potential open redirect vulnerability in Traefik's handling of the \"X-Forwarded-Prefix\"
  header. The Traefik API dashboard component does not validate that the value of
  the header \"X-Forwarded-Prefix\" is a site relative path and will redirect to any
  header provided URI. Successful exploitation of an open redirect can be used to
  entice victims to disclose sensitive information. Active Exploitation of this issue
  is unlikely as it would require active header injection, however the Traefik team
  addressed this issue nonetheless to prevent abuse in e.g. cache poisoning scenarios."
