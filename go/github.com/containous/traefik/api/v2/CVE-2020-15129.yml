package_slug: "go/github.com/containous/traefik/api/v2"
title: "URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')"
description: "In Traefik , there exists a potential open redirect vulnerability in
  Traefik's handling of the \"X-Forwarded-Prefix\" header. The Traefik API dashboard
  component does not validate that the value of the header \"X-Forwarded-Prefix\"
  is a site relative path and will redirect to any header provided URI. Successful
  exploitation of an open redirect can be used to entice victims to disclose sensitive
  information. Active Exploitation of this issue is unlikely as it would require active
  header injection, however the Traefik team addressed this issue nonetheless to prevent
  abuse in e.g. cache poisoning scenarios."
