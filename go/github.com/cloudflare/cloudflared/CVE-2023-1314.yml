title: "cloudflared's Installer has Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability"
description: "A vulnerability has been discovered in cloudflared's installer (<= 2023.3.0)
  for Windows 32-bits devices that allows a local attacker with no administrative
  permissions to escalate their privileges on the affected device. This vulnerability
  exists because the MSI installer used by cloudflared relied on a world-writable
  directory. An attacker with local access to the device (without Administrator rights)
  can use symbolic links to trick the MSI installer into deleting files in locations
  that the attacker would otherwise have no access to. By creating a symlink from
  the world-writable directory to the target file, the attacker can manipulate the
  MSI installer's repair functionality to delete the target file during the repair
  process. Exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to delete important
  system files or replace them with malicious files, potentially leading to the affected
  device being compromised. The cloudflared client itself is not affected by this
  vulnerability, only the installer for 32-bit Windows devices."
