package_slug: "go/github.com/cloudflare/gokey"
title: "gokey allows secret recovery from a seed file without the master password"
description: "In gokey versions `<0.2.0`, a flaw in the seed decryption logic resulted
  in passwords incorrectly being derived solely from the initial vector and the AES-GCM
  authentication tag of the key seed.\n\nThis issue has been fixed in gokey version
  `0.2.0`. This is a breaking change. The fix has invalidated any passwords/secrets
  that were derived from the seed file (using the `-s` option). Even if the input
  seed file stays the same, version `0.2.0` gokey will generate different secrets."
