title: "CIRCL-Fourq: Missing and wrong validation can lead to incorrect results"
description: "The CIRCL implementation of FourQ fails to validate user-supplied low-order
  points during Diffie-Hellman key exchange, potentially allowing attackers to force
  the identity point and compromise session security.\n\nMoreover, there is an incorrect
  point validation in ScalarMult can lead to incorrect results in the isEqual function
  and if a point is on the curve."
