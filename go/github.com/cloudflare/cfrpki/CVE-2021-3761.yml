identifier: "CVE-2021-3761"
package_slug: "go/github.com/cloudflare/cfrpki"
title: "Out-of-bounds Write"
description: "Any CA issuer in the RPKI can trick OctoRPKI into emitting an invalid
  VRP `MaxLength` value, causing RTR sessions to terminate. An attacker can use this
  to disable RPKI Origin Validation in a victim network (for example AS - Cloudflare)
  prior to launching a BGP hijack which during normal operations would be rejected
  as `RPKI invalid`. Additionally, in certain deployments RTR session flapping in
  and of itself also could cause BGP routing churn, causing availability issues."
