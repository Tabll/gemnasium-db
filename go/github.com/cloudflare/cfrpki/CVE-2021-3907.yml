package_slug: "go/github.com/cloudflare/cfrpki"
title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "OctoRPKI does not escape a URI with a filename containing `\"..\"`,
  this allows a repository to create a file, (ex. `rsync://example.org/repo/../../etc/cron.daily/evil.roa`),
  which would then be written to disk outside the base cache folder. This could allow
  for remote code execution on the host machine OctoRPKI is running on."
