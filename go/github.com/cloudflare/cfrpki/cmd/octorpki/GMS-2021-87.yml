package_slug: "go/github.com/cloudflare/cfrpki/cmd/octorpki"
title: "Improper Preservation of Permissions in github.com/cloudflare/cfrpki/cmd/octorpki"
description: "### Impact\n\nWhen copying files with rsync, octorpki uses the \"-a\"
  flag 0, which forces rsync to copy binaries with the suid bit set as root. Since
  the provided service definition defaults to root (https://github.com/cloudflare/cfrpki/blob/master/package/octorpki.service)
  this could allow for a vector, when combined with another vulnerability that causes
  octorpki to process a malicious TAL file, for a local privilege escalation.  \n\n##
