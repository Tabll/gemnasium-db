title: "Trufflehog vulnerable to Blind SSRF in some Detectors"
description: "_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nThis vulnerability
  allows a malicious actor to craft data in a way that, when scanned by specific detectors,
  could trigger the detector to make an unauthorized request to an endpoint chosen
  by the attacker. For an exploit to be effective, the target endpoint must be an
  unauthenticated GET endpoint that produces side effects. The victim must scan the
  maliciously crafted data and have such an endpoint targeted for the exploit to succeed."
