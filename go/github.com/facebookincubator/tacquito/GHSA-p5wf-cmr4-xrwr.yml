title: "Permissive Regular Expression in tacquito"
description: "The CVE is for a software vulnerability. Network admins who have deployed
  tacquito (or versions of tacquito) in their production environments and use tacquito
  to perform command authorization for network devices should be impacted.\n\nTacquito
  code prior to commit 07b49d1358e6ec0b5aa482fcd284f509191119e2 was performing regex
  matches on authorized commands and arguments in a more permissive than intended
  manner. Configured allowed commands/arguments were intended to require a match on
  the entire string, but instead only enforced a match on a sub-string. This behaviour
  could potentially allowed unauthorized commands to be executed."
