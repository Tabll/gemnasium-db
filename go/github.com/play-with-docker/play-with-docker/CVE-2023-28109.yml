title: "Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key"
description: "Play With Docker is a browser-based Docker playground. Versions 0.0.2
  and prior is vulnerable to domain hijacking. Because CORS configuration was not
  correct, an attacker could use `play-with-docker.com` as an example and set the
  origin header in an http request as `evil-play-with-docker.com`. The domain would
  echo in response header, which successfully bypassed the CORS policy and retrieved
  basic user information. This issue has been fixed in commit ed82247c9ab7990ad76ec2bf1498c2b2830b6f1a.
  There are no known workarounds."
