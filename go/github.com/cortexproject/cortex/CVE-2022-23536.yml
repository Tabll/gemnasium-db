title: "External Control of File Name or Path"
description: "Cortex provides multi-tenant, long term storage for Prometheus. A local
  file inclusion vulnerability exists in Cortex versions 1.13.0, 1.13.1 and 1.14.0,
  where a malicious actor could remotely read local files as a result of parsing maliciously
  crafted Alertmanager configurations when submitted to the Alertmanager Set Configuration
  API. Only users of the Alertmanager service where `-experimental.alertmanager.enable-api`
  or `enable_api: true` is configured are affected. Affected Cortex users are advised
  to upgrade to patched versions 1.13.2 or 1.14.1. However as a workaround, Cortex
  administrators may reject Alertmanager configurations containing the `api_key_file`
  setting in the `opsgenie_configs` section before sending to the Set Alertmanager
  Configuration API."
