title: "cert-manager ha a potential slowdown / DoS when parsing specially crafted
  PEM inputs"
description: "cert-manager packages which call the standard library `pem.Decode()`
  function  can take a long time to process specially crafted invalid PEM data.\n\nIf
  an attacker is able to modify PEM data which cert-manager reads (e.g. in a Secret
  resource), they may be able to use large amounts of CPU in the cert-manager controller
  pod to effectively create a denial-of-service (DoS) vector for cert-manager in the
  cluster.\n\nSecrets are limited in size to [1MiB](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#restriction-data-size),
  which reduces the impact of this issue; it was discovered through an ~856kB fuzz
  test input which causes `pem.Decode` to take roughly 750ms to reject the input on
  an M2 Max Macbook Pro. By way of comparison, a valid PEM-encoded 4096-bit RSA key
  takes roughly 70Âµs to parse on the same machine.\n\nGiven the required size of PEM
  data needed to present a realistic DoS vector, an attacker would need to create
  or insert many different large sized resources in the cluster, and so the best secondary
  defense is to ensure that sensible limits are placed via RBAC.\n\nThis issue affects
  all versions of cert-manager to have been released since at least v0.1.0 (since
  `pem.Decode` is core functionality for cert-manager). All [supported releases](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/)
  are patched."
