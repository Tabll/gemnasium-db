package_slug: "go/github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager"
title: "cert-manager-controller DoS via Specially Crafted DNS Response"
description: "The cert-manager-controller performs DNS lookups during ACME DNS-01
  processing (for zone discovery and propagation self-checks). By default, these lookups
  use standard unencrypted DNS.\n\nAn attacker who can intercept and modify DNS traffic
  from the cert-manager-controller pod can insert a crafted entry into cert-manager's
  DNS cache. Accessing this entry will trigger a panic, resulting in Denial of Service
  (DoS) of the cert-manager controller.\n\nThe issue can also be exploited if the
  authoritative DNS server for the domain being validated is controlled by a malicious
  actor."
