title: "Duplicate Advisory: cert-manager ha a potential slowdown / DoS when parsing
  specially crafted PEM inputs"
description: "# Duplicate Advisory\n\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it
  is a duplicate of GHSA-r4pg-vg54-wxx4. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n# Original Description\n\nA flaw was found in the cert-manager package.
  This flaw allows an attacker who can modify PEM data that the cert-manager reads,
  for example, in a Secret resource, to use large amounts of CPU in the cert-manager
  controller pod to effectively create a denial-of-service (DoS) vector for the cert-manager
  in the cluster."
