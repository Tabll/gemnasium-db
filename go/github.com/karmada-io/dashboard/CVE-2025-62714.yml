package_slug: "go/github.com/karmada-io/dashboard"
title: "Karmada Dashboard API Unauthorized Access Vulnerability "
description: "This is an authentication bypass vulnerability in the Karmada Dashboard
  API. The backend API endpoints (e.g., /api/v1/secret, /api/v1/service) did not enforce
  authentication, allowing unauthenticated users to access sensitive cluster information
  such as Secrets and Services directly. Although the web UI required a valid JWT
  for access, the API itself remained exposed to direct requests without any authentication
  checks. Any user or entity with network access to the Karmada Dashboard service
  could exploit this vulnerability to retrieve sensitive data."
