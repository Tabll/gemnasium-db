title: "Karmada Tar Slips in CRDs archive extraction"
description: "_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nBoth in karmadactl
  and karmada-operator, it is possible to supply a filesystem path, or an HTTP(s)
  URL to retrieve the custom resource definitions(CRDs) needed by karmada. The CRDs
  are downloaded as a gzipped tarfile and are vulnerable to a TarSlip vulnerability.
  An attacker able to supply a malicious CRD file into a karmada initialization could
  write arbitrary files in arbitrary paths of the filesystem."
