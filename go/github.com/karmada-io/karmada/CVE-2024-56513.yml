title: "Karmada PULL Mode Cluster Privilege Escalation"
description: "_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nThe [PULL](https://karmada.io/docs/next/userguide/clustermanager/cluster-registration#pull-mode)
  mode clusters registered with the `karmadactl register` command have excessive privileges
  to access control plane resources. By abusing these permissions, an attacker able
  to authenticate as the karmada-agent to a karmada cluster would be able to obtain
  administrative privileges over the entire federation system including all registered
  member clusters."
