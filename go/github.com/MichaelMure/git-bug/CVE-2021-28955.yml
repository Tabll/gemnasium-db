package_slug: "go/github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug"
title: "Arbitrary code execution due to an uncontrolled search path for the git binary"
description: "The go language recently addressed a security issue in the way that
  binaries are found before being executed. Some operating systems like Windows persist
  to have the current directory being part of the default search path, and having
  priority over the system-wide path.\n\nThis means that it's possible for a malicious
  user to craft for example a `git.bat` command, commit it and push it in a repository.
  Later when git-bug search for the git binary, this malicious executable can take
  priority  and be executed."
