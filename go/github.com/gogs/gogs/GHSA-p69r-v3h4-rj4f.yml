description: "# Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-vm62-9jw3-c8w3. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n# Original Description\nThe built-in SSH server of Gogs through 0.13.0
  allows argument injection in internal/ssh/ssh.go, leading to remote code execution.
  Authenticated attackers can exploit this by opening an SSH connection and sending
  a malicious --split-string env request if the built-in SSH server is activated.
  Windows installations are unaffected."
