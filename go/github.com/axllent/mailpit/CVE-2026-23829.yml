title: "Mailpit has an SMTP Header Injection via Regex Bypass"
description: "Mailpit's SMTP server is vulnerable to **Header Injection** due to an
  insufficient Regular Expression used to validate `RCPT TO` and `MAIL FROM` addresses.
  An attacker can inject arbitrary SMTP headers (or corrupt existing ones) by including
  carriage return characters (`\\r`) in the email address. This header injection occurs
  because the regex intended to filter control characters fails to exclude `\\r` and
  `\\n` when used inside a character class."
