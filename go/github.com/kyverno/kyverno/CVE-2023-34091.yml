title: "Kyverno resource with a deletionTimestamp may allow policy circumvention"
description: "Kyverno is a policy engine designed for Kubernetes. In versions of Kyverno
  prior to 1.10.0, resources which have the `deletionTimestamp` field defined can
  bypass validate, generate, or mutate-existing policies, even in cases where the
  `validationFailureAction` field is set to `Enforce`. This situation occurs as resources
  pending deletion were being consciously exempted by Kyverno, as a way to reduce
  processing load as policies are typically not applied to objects which are being
  deleted. However, this could potentially result in allowing a malicious user to
  leverage the Kubernetes finalizers feature by setting a finalizer which causes the
  Kubernetes API server to set the `deletionTimestamp` and then not completing the
  delete operation as a way to explicitly to bypass a Kyverno policy. Note that this
  is not applicable to Kubernetes Pods but, as an example, a Kubernetes Service resource
  can be manipulated using an indefinite finalizer to bypass policies. This is resolved
  in Kyverno 1.10.0. There is no known workaround."
