title: "Kyverno Cross-Namespace Privilege Escalation via Policy apiCall"
description: "A critical authorization boundary bypass in namespaced Kyverno Policy
  [apiCall](https://kyverno.io/docs/policy-types/cluster-policy/external-data-sources/#url-paths).
  The resolved `urlPath` is executed using the Kyverno admission controller ServiceAccount,
  with no enforcement that the request is limited to the policy’s namespace.\n\nAs
  a result, any authenticated user with permission to create a namespaced Policy can
  cause Kyverno to perform Kubernetes API requests using Kyverno’s admission controller
  identity, targeting any API path allowed by that ServiceAccount’s RBAC. This breaks
  namespace isolation by enabling cross-namespace reads (for example, ConfigMaps and,
  where permitted, Secrets) and allows cluster-scoped or cross-namespace writes (for
  example, creating ClusterPolicies) by controlling the urlPath through context variable
  substitution."
