title: "Kyverno vulnerable to bypass of policy rules that use namespace selectors
  in match statements"
description: "Due to a missing error propagation in function `GetNamespaceSelectorsFromNamespaceLister`
  in `pkg/utils/engine/labels.go` it may happen that policy rules using namespace
  selector(s) in their `match` statements are mistakenly not applied during admission
  review request processing. As a consequence, security-critical mutations and validations
  are bypassed, potentially allowing attackers with K8s API access to perform malicious
  operations."
