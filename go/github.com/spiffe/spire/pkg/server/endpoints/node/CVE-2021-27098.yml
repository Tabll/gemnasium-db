package_slug: "go/github.com/spiffe/spire/pkg/server/endpoints/node"
title: "Improper Certificate Validation"
description: "In SPIRE 0.8.1 through 0.8.4 and before versions 0.9.4, 0.10.2, 0.11.3
  and 0.12.1, specially crafted requests to the FetchX509SVID RPC of SPIRE Serverâ€™s
  Legacy Node API can result in the possible issuance of an X.509 certificate with
  a URI SAN for a SPIFFE ID that the agent is not authorized to distribute. Proper
  controls are in place to require that the caller presents a valid agent certificate
  that is already authorized to issue at least one SPIFFE ID, and the requested SPIFFE
  ID belongs to the same trust domain, prior to being able to trigger this vulnerability.
  This issue has been fixed in SPIRE versions 0.8.5, 0.9.4, 0.10.2, 0.11.3 and 0.12.1."
