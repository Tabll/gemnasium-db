title: "Unbounded memory usage on exposed HTTP/2 (non-gRPC) endpoints"
description: "### Impact\nThe net/http Go package has a reported vulnerability tracked
  under CVE-2021-44716 which allows attacker controlled HTTP/2 requests to trigger
  unbounded memory usage in HTTP/2 endpoints. gRPC endpoints are not vulnerable as
  they rely on their own HTTP/2 implementation instead of the net/http package. HTTP/2
  endpoints consuming the net/http package within SPIRE server and agent (or other
  components in this repository) that are _on by default_ include the following:\n-
  OIDC Discovery Provider\n- K8s Workload Registrar in webhook mode\n\nThe following
  endpoints are vulnerable _when enabled_:\n- SPIRE server bundle endpoint (i.e. Federation
  API)\n\nThe following endpoints are _NOT_ vulnerable, since HTTP/2 support in go
  is not enabled on non-TLS protected endpoints:\n- SPIRE server/agent metrics endpoint
  when configured for Prometheus\n- SPIRE server/agent health endpoints\n- SPIRE server/agent
  profiling endpoints\n\n### Patches\nSPIRE 1.0.3 and 1.1.3 have been released with
  an upgraded Go toolchain which patches the vulnerability\n\n### Workarounds\nThe
  vulnerability can be worked around entirely by including the `http2server=0` value
  in the `GODEBUG` environment variable (see https://github.com/golang/go/issues/50058).
  This turns off HTTP/2 support on all non-gRPC endpoints. They will still function
  with HTTP/1.1.\n\nThe risk associated with this vulnerability can be somewhat mitigated
  by limiting the exposure of the endpoints in question. If necessary, vulnerable
  components or endpoints that are optionally configured can be disabled temporarily.\n\n###
