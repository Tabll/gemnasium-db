identifier: "CVE-2020-8558"
package_slug: "go/github.com/kubernetes/kube-proxy"
title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "kube-proxy was found to contain a security issue which allows adjacent
  hosts to reach TCP and UDP services bound to localhost running on the node or in
  the node's network namespace. Such a service is generally thought to be reachable
  only by other processes on the same host, but due to this defeect, could be reachable
  by other hosts on the same LAN as the node, or by containers running on the same
  node as the service."
