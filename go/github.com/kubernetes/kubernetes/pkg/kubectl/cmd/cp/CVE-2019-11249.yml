identifier: "CVE-2019-11249"
package_slug: "go/github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pkg/kubectl/cmd/cp"
title: "Code Injection"
description: "The kubectl cp command allows copying files between containers and the
  user machine. To copy files from a container, Kubernetes runs tar inside the container
  to create a tar archive, copies it over the network, and kubectl unpacks it on the
  user's machine. If the tar binary in the container is malicious, it could run any
  code and output unexpected, malicious results. An attacker could use this to write
  files to any path on the user's machine when kubectl cp is called, limited only
  by the system permissions of the local user."
