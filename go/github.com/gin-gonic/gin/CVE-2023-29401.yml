package_slug: "go/github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
title: "Gin Web Framework does not properly sanitize filename parameter of Context.FileAttachment
  function"
description: "The filename parameter of the Context.FileAttachment function is not
  properly sanitized. A maliciously crafted filename can cause the Content-Disposition
  header to be sent with an unexpected filename value or otherwise modify the Content-Disposition
  header. For example, a filename of \"setup.bat&quot;;x=.txt\" will be sent as a
  file named \"setup.bat\".\n\nIf the FileAttachment function is called with names
  provided by an untrusted source, this may permit an attacker to cause a file to
  be served with a name different than provided. Maliciously crafted attachment file
  name can modify the Content-Disposition header."
