title: "Improper input validation in github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
description: "Versions of the package github.com/gin-gonic/gin before 1.9.0 is vulnerable
  to Improper Input Validation by allowing an attacker to use a specially crafted
  request via the X-Forwarded-Prefix header, potentially leading to cache poisoning.\r\r**Note:**
  Although this issue does not pose a significant threat on its own it can serve as
  an input vector for other more impactful vulnerabilities. However, successful exploitation
  may depend on the server configuration and whether the header is used in the application
  logic."
