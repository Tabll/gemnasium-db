title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "teler-waf is a Go HTTP middleware that provides teler IDS functionality
  to protect against web-based attacks. In teler-waf prior to version v0.2.0 is vulnerable
  to a bypass attack when a specific case-sensitive hex entities payload with special
  characters such as CR/LF and horizontal tab is used. This vulnerability allows an
  attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the victim's browser and compromise
  the security of the web application. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability
  to bypass common web attack threat rules in teler-waf and launch cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attacks. The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the victim's
  browser and steal sensitive information, such as login credentials and session tokens,
  or take control of the victim's browser and perform malicious actions. This issue
  has been patched in version 0.2.0."
