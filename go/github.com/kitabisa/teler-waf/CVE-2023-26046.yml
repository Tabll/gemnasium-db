title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "teler-waf is a Go HTTP middleware that provides teler IDS functionality
  to protect against web-based attacks. In teler-waf prior to version 0.1.1 is vulnerable
  to bypassing common web attack rules when a specific HTML entities payload is used.
  This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the
  victim's browser and compromise the security of the web application. The vulnerability
  exists due to teler-waf failure to properly sanitize and filter HTML entities in
  user input. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to bypass common web attack
  threat rules in teler-waf and launch cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The attacker
  can execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the victim's browser and steal sensitive
  information, such as login credentials and session tokens, or take control of the
  victim's browser and perform malicious actions. This issue has been fixed in version
  0.1.1."
