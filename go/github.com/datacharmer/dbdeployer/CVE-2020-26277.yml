package_slug: "go/github.com/datacharmer/dbdeployer"
title: "Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')"
description: "DBdeployer is a tool that deploys MySQL database servers easily. In
  DBdeployer, users unpacking a tarball may use a maliciously packaged tarball that
  contains symlinks to files external to the target. In such scenario, an attacker
  could induce dbdeployer to write into a system file, thus altering the computer
  defenses. For the attack to succeed, the following factors need to contribute: 1)
  The user is logged in as root. While dbdeployer is usable as root, it was designed
  to run as unprivileged user. 2) The user has taken a tarball from a non secure source,
  without testing the checksum. When the tarball is retrieved through dbdeployer,
  the checksum is compared before attempting to unpack."
