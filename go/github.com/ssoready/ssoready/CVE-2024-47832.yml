title: "SSOReady has an XML Signature Bypass via differential XML parsing"
description: "Affected versions are vulnerable to XML signature bypass attacks. An
  attacker can carry out signature bypass if you have access to certain IDP-signed
  messages. The underlying mechanism exploits differential behavior between XML parsers.\n\nUsers
  of https://ssoready.com, the public hosted instance of SSOReady, are unaffected.
  We advise folks who self-host SSOReady to upgrade to 7f92a06 or later. Do so by
  updating your SSOReady Docker images from `sha-...` to `sha-7f92a06`. The documentation
  for self-hosting SSOReady is available [here](https://ssoready.com/docs/self-hosting/self-hosting-sso-ready).\n\nVulnerability
  was discovered by @ahacker1-securesaml. It's likely the precise mechanism of attack
  affects other SAML implementations, so the reporter and I (@ucarion) have agreed
  to not disclose it in detail publicly at this time."
