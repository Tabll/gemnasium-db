package_slug: "go/github.com/openkruise/kruise"
title: "Improper Privilege Management"
description: "Kruise provides automated management of large-scale applications on
  Kubernetes. Starting in version 0.8.0 and prior to versions 1.3.1, 1.4.1, and 1.5.2,
  an attacker who has gained root privilege of the node that kruise-daemon run can
  leverage the kruise-daemon pod to list all secrets in the entire cluster. After
  that, the attacker can leverage the \"captured\" secrets (e.g. the kruise-manager
  service account token) to gain extra privileges such as pod modification. Versions
  1.3.1, 1.4.1, and 1.5.2 fix this issue. A workaround is available. For users that
  do not require imagepulljob functions, they can modify kruise-daemon-role to drop
  the cluster level secret get/list privilege."
