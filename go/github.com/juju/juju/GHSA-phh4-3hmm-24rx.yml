title: "Duplicate Advisory: Juju makes Use of Weak Credentials"
description: "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-mh98-763h-m9v4. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n## Original Description\nJUJU_CONTEXT_ID is a predictable authentication
  secret. On a Juju machine (non-Kubernetes) or Juju charm container (on Kubernetes),
  an unprivileged user in the same network namespace can connect to an abstract domain
  socket and guess the JUJU_CONTEXT_ID value. This gives the unprivileged user access
  to the same information and tools as the Juju charm."
