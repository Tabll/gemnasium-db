package_slug: "go/github.com/anchore/stereoscope"
title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "stereoscope is a go library for processing container images and simulating
  a squash filesystem. Prior to version 0.0.1, it is possible to craft an OCI tar
  archive that, when stereoscope attempts to unarchive the contents, will result in
  writing to paths outside of the unarchive temporary directory. Specifically, use
  of `github.com/anchore/stereoscope/pkg/file.UntarToDirectory()` function, the `github.com/anchore/stereoscope/pkg/image/oci.TarballImageProvider`
  struct, or the higher level `github.com/anchore/stereoscope/pkg/image.Image.Read()`
  function express this vulnerability. As a workaround, if you are using the OCI archive
  as input into stereoscope then you can switch to using an OCI layout by unarchiving
  the tar archive and provide the unarchived directory to stereoscope."
