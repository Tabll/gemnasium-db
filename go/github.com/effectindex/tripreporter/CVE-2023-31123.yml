package_slug: "go/github.com/effectindex/tripreporter"
title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "`effectindex/tripreporter` is a community-powered, universal platform
  for submitting and analyzing trip reports. Prior to commit bd80ba833b9023d39ca22e29874296c8729dd53b,
  any user with an account on an instance of `effectindex/tripreporter`, e.g. `subjective.report`,
  may be affected by an improper password verification vulnerability. The vulnerability
  allows any user with a password matching the password requirements to log in as
  any user. This allows access to accounts / data loss of the user. This issue is
  patched in commit bd80ba833b9023d39ca22e29874296c8729dd53b. No action necessary
  for users of `subjective.report`, and anyone running their own instance should update
  to this commit or newer as soon as possible. As a workaround, someone running their
  own instance may apply the patch manually."
