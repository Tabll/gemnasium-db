title: "Weaviate OSS has a Path Traversal Vulnerability via Backup ZipSlip"
description: "An issue was discovered in Weaviate OSS before 1.33.4. An attacker with
  access to insert data into the database can craft an entry name with an absolute
  path (e.g., /etc/...) or use parent directory traversal (../../..) to escape the
  restore root when a backup is restored, potentially creating or overwriting files
  in arbitrary locations within the application's privilege scope."
