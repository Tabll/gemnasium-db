title: "Weaviate OSS has path traversal vulnerability via the Shard Movement API"
description: "An issue was discovered in Weaviate OSS before 1.33.4. Due to a lack
  of validation of the fileName field in the transfer logic, an attacker who can call
  the GetFile method while a shard is in the \"Pause file activity\" state and the
  FileReplicationService is reachable can read arbitrary files accessible to the service
  process."
