title: " Devtron Attributes API Unauthorized Access Leading to API Token Signing Key
  Leakage"
description: "This vulnerability exists in Devtron's Attributes API interface, allowing
  any authenticated user (including low-privileged CI/CD Developers) to obtain the
  global API Token signing key by accessing the `/orchestrator/attributes?key=apiTokenSecret`
  endpoint. After obtaining the key, attackers can forge JWT tokens for arbitrary
  user identities offline, thereby gaining complete control over the Devtron platform
  and laterally moving to the underlying Kubernetes cluster.\n\n**CWE Classification**:
