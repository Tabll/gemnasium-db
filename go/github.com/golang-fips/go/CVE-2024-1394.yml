title: "Memory leaks in code encrypting and verifying RSA payloads"
description: "Using crafted public RSA keys which are not compliant with SP 800-56B
  can cause a small memory leak when encrypting and verifying payloads.\n\nAn attacker
  can leverage this flaw to gradually erode available memory to the point where the
  host crashes for lack of resources. Upon restart the attacker would have to begin
  again, but nevertheless there is the potential to deny service."
