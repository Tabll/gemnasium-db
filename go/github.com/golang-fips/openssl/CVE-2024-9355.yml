title: "Golang FIPS OpenSSL has a Use of Uninitialized Variable vulnerability"
description: "A vulnerability was found in Golang FIPS OpenSSL. This flaw allows a
  malicious user to randomly cause an uninitialized buffer length variable with a
  zeroed buffer to be returned in FIPS mode. It may also be possible to force a false
  positive match between non-equal hashes when comparing a trusted computed hmac sum
  to an untrusted input sum if an attacker can send a zeroed buffer in place of a
  pre-computed sum.  It is also possible to force a derived key to be all zeros instead
  of an unpredictable value.  This may have follow-on implications for the Go TLS
  stack."
