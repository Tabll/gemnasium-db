title: "mx-chain-go does not treat invalid transaction with wrong username correctly"
description: "mx-chain-go is an implementation of the MultiversX blockchain protocol
  written in the Go language. Metachain cannot process a cross-shard miniblock. Prior
  to version 1.4.16, an invalid transaction with the wrong username on metachain is
  not treated correctly on the metachain transaction processor. This is strictly a
  processing issue that could have happened on MultiversX chain. If an error like
  this had occurred, the metachain would have stopped notarizing blocks from the shard
  chains. The resuming of notarization is possible only after applying a patched binary
  version. A patch in version 1.4.16 introduces `processIfTxErrorCrossShard` for the
  metachain transaction processor. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n"
