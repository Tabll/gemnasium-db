package_slug: "go/github.com/multiversx/mx-chain-go"
title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "mx-chain-go is the official implementation of the MultiversX blockchain
  protocol, written in golang. When executing a relayed transaction, if the inner
  transaction failed, it would have increased the inner transaction's sender account
  nonce. This could have contributed to a limited DoS attack on a targeted account.
  The fix is a breaking change so a new flag `RelayedNonceFixEnableEpoch` was needed.
  This was a strict processing issue while validating blocks on a chain. This vulnerability
  has been patched in version 1.4.17."
