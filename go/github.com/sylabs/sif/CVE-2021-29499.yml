title: "Use of Insufficiently Random Values"
description: "SIF is an open source implementation of the Singularity Container Image
  Format. The `siftool new` command and func siftool.New() produce predictable UUID
  identifiers due to insecure randomness in the version of the `github.com/satori/go.uuid`

  Users are encouraged to upgrade."
