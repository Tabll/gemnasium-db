title: "Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints"
description: "Singularity is an open source container platform. In verions 3.7.2 and
  3.7.3, Dde to incorrect use of a default URL, `singularity` action commands (`run`/`shell`/`exec`)
  specifying a container using a `library://` URI will always attempt to retrieve
  the container from the default remote endpoint (`cloud.sylabs.io`) rather than the
  configured remote endpoint. An attacker may be able to push a malicious container
  to the default remote endpoint with a URI that is identical to the URI used by a
  victim with a non-default remote endpoint, thus executing the malicious container.
  Only action commands (`run`/`shell`/`exec`) against `library://` URIs are affected.
  Other commands such as `pull` / `push` respect the configured remote endpoint. The
  vulnerability is patched in Singularity version 3.7.4. Two possible workarounds
  exist: Users can only interact with the default remote endpoint, or an installation
  can have an execution control list configured to restrict execution to containers
  signed with specific secure keys."
