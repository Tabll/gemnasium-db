identifier: "CVE-2019-11328"
package_slug: "go/github.com/sylabs/singularity"
title: "Improper Access Control"
description: "An issue was discovered in Singularity, a malicious user with local/network
  access to the host system (e.g. ssh) could exploit this vulnerability due to insecure
  permissions allowing a user to edit files within `/run/singularity/instances/sing/<user>/<instance>`.
  The manipulation of those files can change the behavior of the starter-suid program
  when instances are joined resulting in potential privilege escalation on the host."
