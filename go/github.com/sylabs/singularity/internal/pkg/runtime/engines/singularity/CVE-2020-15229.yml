identifier: "CVE-2020-15229"
package_slug: "go/github.com/sylabs/singularity/internal/pkg/runtime/engines/singularity"
title: "Path Traversal"
description: "Singularity (an open source container platform) from has a vulnerability.
  Due to insecure handling of path traversal and the lack of path sanitization within
  `unsquashfs`, it is possible to `overwrite/create` any files on the host filesystem
  during the extraction with a crafted squashfs filesystem. The extraction occurs
  automatically for unprivileged (either installation or with `allow setuid = no`)
  run of Singularity when a user attempt to run an image which is a local SIF image
  or a single file containing a squashfs filesystem and is coming from remote sources
  `library:`//` or `shub:`//`.` Image build is also impacted in a more serious way
  as it can be used by a root user, allowing an attacker to `overwrite/create` files
  leading to a system compromise, so far bootstrap methods `library`, `shub` and `localimage`
  are triggering the squashfs extraction. This issue is addressed in Singularity All
  users are advised to upgrade to especially if they use Singularity mainly for building
  image as root user."
