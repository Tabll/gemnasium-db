description: "# CWA-2024-008\n\n**Severity**\n\nMedium (Moderate + Likely)[^1]\n\n**Affected
  versions:**\n\n- wasmvm >= 2.1.0, < 2.1.3\n- wasmvm >= 2.0.0, < 2.0.4\n- wasmvm
  < 1.5.5\n- cosmwasm-vm >= 2.1.0, < 2.1.4\n- cosmwasm-vm >= 2.0.0, < 2.0.7\n- cosmwasm-vm
  < 1.5.8\n\n**Patched versions:**\n\n- wasmvm 1.5.5, 2.0.4, 2.1.3\n- cosmwasm-vm
  1.5.8, 2.0.7, 2.1.4\n\n## Description of the bug\n\n(Blank for now. We'll add more
  detail once chains had a chance to upgrade.)\n\n## Patch\n\n- 1.5: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/commit/edcdbc520d4f5521eed42de6e2869658278e91fd\n-
  2.0: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/commit/f63429ca59eb44dd5d780c1572016581337091e4\n-
  2.1: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/commit/108e7dcbf9c21df0fa83f355ad3a7355d7f220cb\n\n##
  Applying the patch\n\nThe patch will be shipped in releases of wasmvm. You can update
  more or less as follows:\n\n1. Check the current wasmvm version: `go list -m github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm`\n2.
  Bump the `github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm` dependency in your go.mod to 1.5.5, 2.0.4,
  2.1.3 depending on which minor version you are; `go mod tidy`; commit.\n3. If you
  use the static libraries `libwasmvm_muslc.aarch64.a`/`libwasmvm_muslc.x86_64.a`,
  update them accordingly.\n4. Check the updated wasmvm version: `go list -m github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm`
  and ensure you see 1.5.5, 2.0.4, 2.1.3.\n5. Follow your regular practices to deploy
  chain upgrades.\n\nTo double check if the correct library version is loaded at runtime,
  use this query:\n`<appd> query wasm libwasmvm-version`. It must show 1.5.5, 2.0.4
  or 2.1.3.\n\nThe patch is consensus breaking and requires a coordinated upgrade.\n\n##
