description: "# CWA-2025-006: Improper error handling may lead to IBC channel opening
  despite error\n\n**Severity**\n\nHigh (Considerable + Likely)[^1]\n\n**Affected
  versions:**\n\n- wasmd 0.60.0\n- wasmd >= 0.51.0 < 0.55.1\n\n**Patched versions:**\n\n-
  wasmd 0.60.1, 0.55.1, 0.54.1, 0.53.3\n\n## Description of the bug\n\nA contract
  erroring during IBC channel opening does not prevent the channel from opening.\n\n##
  Applying the patch\n\nThe patch will be shipped in a wasmd release. You will also
  have to update `libwasmvm` if you build statically.\nIf you already use the latest
  / close to latest wasmd, you can update more or less as follows:\n\n1. Check the
  current wasmd version: `go list -m github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd`\n2. Bump the `github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd`
  dependency in your go.mod to 0.60.1 (Cosmos SDK 0.53 compatible), 0.55.1 (Cosmos
  SDK 0.50 compatible), 0.54.1 or 0.53.3; `go mod tidy`; commit.\n3. If you use the
  static libraries `libwasmvm_muslc.aarch64.a`/`libwasmvm_muslc.x86_64.a`, make sure
  that you use the same version as your wasmvm version.\n4. Check the updated wasmd
  version: `go list -m github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd` and ensure you see 0.60.1, 0.55.1,
  0.54.1 or 0.53.3.\n5. Follow your regular practices to deploy chain upgrades.\n\nThe
  patch is consensus breaking.\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis problem was discovered
  during an audit of the CosmWasm stack performed by Sherlock and funded by ICF/ICL
  in Q1 2025. Thank you for that work!\n\nIf you believe you have found a bug in the
  Interchain Stack or would like to contribute to the\nprogram by reporting a bug,
  please see <https://hackerone.com/cosmos>.\n\n## Timeline\n\n- 2025-03-03: Auditor
  informs Confio about this issue.\n- 2025-04-10: Confio developed the patch internally.\n-
  2025-06-05: Upcoming patch is announced.\n- 2025-06-10: Patch is released."
