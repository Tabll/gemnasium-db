title: "Octo STS Unauthenticated SSRF by abusing fields in OpenID Connect tokens"
description: "Octo-STS versions before v0.5.3 are vulnerable to unauthenticated SSRF
  by abusing fields in OpenID Connect tokens. Malicious tokens were shown to trigger
  internal network requests which could reflect error logs with sensitive information.\n\nPlease
  upgrade to v0.5.3 to resolve this issue. This version includes patch sets to [sanitize
  input](https://github.com/octo-sts/app/commit/b3976e39bd8c8c217c0670747d34a4499043da92)
  and [redact logging](https://github.com/octo-sts/app/commit/0f177fde54f9318e33f0bba6abaea9463a7c3afd).\n\nMany
  thanks to @vicevirus for reporting this issue and for assisting with remediation
