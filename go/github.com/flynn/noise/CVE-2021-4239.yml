package_slug: "go/github.com/flynn/noise"
title: "Noise vulnerable to uncontrolled resource consumption"
description: "The Noise protocol implementation suffers from weakened cryptographic
  security after encrypting 2^64 messages, and a potential denial of service attack.
  After 2^64 (~18.4 quintillion) messages are encrypted with the Encrypt function,
  the nonce counter will wrap around, causing multiple messages to be encrypted with
  the same key and nonce. In a separate issue, the Decrypt function increments the
  nonce state even when it fails to decrypt a message. If an attacker can provide
  an invalid input to the Decrypt function, this will cause the nonce state to desynchronize
  between the peers, resulting in a failure to encrypt all subsequent messages."
