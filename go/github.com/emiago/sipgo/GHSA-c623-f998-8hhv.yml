title: "SIPGO is Vulnerable to Response DoS via Nil Pointer Dereference"
description: "A nil pointer dereference vulnerability was discovered in the SIPGO
  library's `NewResponseFromRequest` function that affects all normal SIP operations.
  The vulnerability allows remote attackers to crash any SIP application by sending
  a single malformed SIP request without a To header.\n\nThe vulnerability occurs
  when SIP message parsing succeeds for a request missing the To header, but the response
  creation code assumes the To header exists without proper nil checks. This affects
  routine operations like call setup, authentication, and message handling - not just
  error cases.\n\n> Note: This vulnerability affects all SIP applications using the
  sipgo library, not just specific configurations or edge cases, as long as they make
  use of the `NewResponseFromRequest` function."
