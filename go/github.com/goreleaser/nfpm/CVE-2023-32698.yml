title: "nfpm has incorrect default permissions"
description: "### Summary\nWhen building packages directly from source control, file
  permissions on the checked-in files are not maintained. \n\n### Details\nWhen building
  packages directly from source control, file permissions on the checked-in files
  are not maintained. When nfpm packaged the files (without extra config for enforcing
  its own permissions) files could go out with bad permissions (chmod 666 or 777).\n\n###
  PoC\nCreate a default nfpm structure. \n\nWithin the test folder, create 3 files
  named `chmod-XXX.sh`. Each script has file \npermissions set corresponding with
  their file names (`chmod-777.sh` = `chmod 777`). Below each \nfile and permissions
  can be seen.\n\n```console\n$ ls -lart test \ntotal 24\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 user group
  11 May 19 13:15 chmod-777.sh\n-rw-rw-rw- 1 user group 11 May 19 13:16 chmod-666.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x
  5 user group 160 May 19 13:19 .\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 user group 11 May 19 13:19 chmod-664.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x
  10 user group 320 May 19 13:29 ..\n```\n\nBelow is the snippet nfpm configuration
  file of the contents of the package. The test folder \nand files has no extra config
  for enforcing permissions. \n\n```yaml\ncontents:\n- src: foo-binary\n dst: /usr/bin/bar\n-
  src: bar-config.conf\n dst: /etc/foo-binary/bar-config.conf\n type: config\n- src:
  test\n dst: /etc/test/scripts\n```\n\nThe next step is to create a deb package.\n\n```console\n$
  nfpm package -p deb # Create dep package\nusing deb packager...\ncreated package:
  foo_1.0.0_arm64.deb\n```\n\nWhen on a Ubuntu VM, install the foo package which was
  created\n\n```console\n$ sudo dpkg -i foo_1.0.0_arm64.deb # Installing deb package
  within Ubuntu\nSelecting previously unselected package foo.\n(Reading database ...
  67540 files and directories currently installed.)\nPreparing to unpack foo_1.0.0_arm64.deb
  ...\nUnpacking foo (1.0.0) ...\nSetting up foo (1.0.0) ...\n```\n\nLooking at `/etc/test/scripts`
  and viewing the permissions. Permissions are passed exactly the same as the source.\n\n```console\n$
  ls -lart /etc/test/scripts\ntotal 20\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 11 May 22 12:15 chmod-777.sh\n-rw-rw-rw-
  1 root root 11 May 22 12:16 chmod-666.sh\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 root root 11 May 22 12:19
  chmod-664.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 May 22 13:00 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root
  4096 May 22 13:00 .\n```\n\n\n## Solution\nTo prevent world-writable files from
  making it into the packages, add the ability to override the default permissions
  of packaged files using a umask config option in the packaging spec file. This feature
  in nfpm would allow applying a global umask across any files being packaged, therefore,
  with the correct configuration, preventing world-writable files without needing
  to list permissions on each and every file in the package\n\n\n### Impact\n\nVulnerability
  is https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/276.html\nhttps://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\n\nAnyone
  using nfpm for creating packages and not checking/setting file permissions before
  packaging could result in bad permissions for files/folders."
