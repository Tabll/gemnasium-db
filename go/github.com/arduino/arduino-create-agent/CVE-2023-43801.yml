title: "Arduino Create Agent path traversal - arbitrary file deletion vulnerability"
description: "Arduino Create Agent is a package to help manage Arduino development.
  This vulnerability affects the endpoint `/v2/pkgs/tools/installed` and the way it
  handles plugin names supplied as user input. A user who has the ability to perform
  HTTP requests to the localhost interface, or is able to bypass the CORS configuration,
  can delete arbitrary files or folders belonging to the user that runs the Arduino
  Create Agent via a crafted HTTP DELETE request. This issue has been addressed in
  version `1.3.3`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for
  this issue.\n"
