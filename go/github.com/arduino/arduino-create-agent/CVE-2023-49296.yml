package_slug: "go/github.com/arduino/arduino-create-agent"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "The Arduino Create Agent allows users to use the Arduino Create applications
  to upload code to any USB connected Arduino board directly from the browser. A vulnerability
  in versions prior to 1.3.6 affects the endpoint `/certificate.crt` and the way the
  web interface of the ArduinoCreateAgent handles custom error messages. An attacker
  that is able to persuade a victim into clicking on a malicious link can perform
  a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting attack on the web interface of the create agent,
  which would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary browser client side code. Version
  1.3.6 contains a fix for the issue.\n"
