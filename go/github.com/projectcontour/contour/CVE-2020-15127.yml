identifier: "CVE-2020-15127"
package_slug: "go/github.com/projectcontour/contour"
title: "Missing Authentication for Critical Function"
description: "In Contour (Ingress controller for Kubernetes), a bad actor can shut
  down all instances of Envoy, essentially killing the entire ingress data plane.
  GET requests to /shutdown on port of the Envoy pod initiate Envoy's shutdown procedure.
  The shutdown procedure includes flipping the readiness endpoint to `false`, which
  removes Envoy from the routing pool. When running Envoy (For example on the host
  network, pod spec `hostNetwork=true`), the shutdown manager's endpoint is accessible
  to anyone on the network that can reach the Kubernetes node that's running Envoy.
  There is no authentication in place that prevents a rogue actor on the network from
  shutting down Envoy via the shutdown manager endpoint. Successful exploitation of
  this issue will lead to bad actors shutting down all instances of Envoy, essentially
  killing the entire ingress data plane."
