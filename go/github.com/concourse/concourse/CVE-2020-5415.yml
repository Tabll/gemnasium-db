title: "GitLab auth uses full name instead of username as user ID, allowing impersonation"
description: "Installations which use the GitLab auth connector are vulnerable to
  identity spoofing by way of configuring a GitLab account with the same full name
  as another GitLab user who is granted access to a Concourse team by having their
  full name listed under `users` in the team configuration or given to the `--gitlab-user`
  flag.\n\nSee the [GitLab auth docs](https://concourse-ci.org/gitlab-auth.html) for
  details.\n\nConcourse installations which do not configure the GitLab auth connector
  are not affected."
