package_slug: "go/github.com/concourse/concourse"
title: "Authentication Bypass by Spoofing"
description: "Concourse, in installations which use the GitLab auth connector, is
  vulnerable to identity spoofing by way of configuring a GitLab account with the
  same full name as another user who is granted access to a Concourse team. GitLab
  groups do not have this vulnerability, so GitLab users may be moved into groups
  which are then configured in the Concourse team."
