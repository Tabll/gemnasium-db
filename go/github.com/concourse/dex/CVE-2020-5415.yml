title: "Authentication Bypass by Spoofing"
description: "Concourse, versions prior to 6.3.1 and 6.4.1, in installations which
  use the GitLab auth connector, is vulnerable to identity spoofing by way of configuring
  a GitLab account with the same full name as another user who is granted access to
  a Concourse team. GitLab groups do not have this vulnerability, so GitLab users
  may be moved into groups which are then configured in the Concourse team."
