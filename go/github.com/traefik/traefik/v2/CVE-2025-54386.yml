title: "Traefik Client Plugin's Path Traversal Vulnerability Allows Arbitrary File
  Overwrite and Remote Code Execution"
description: "A path traversal vulnerability was discovered in WASM Traefik’s plugin
  installation mechanism. By supplying a maliciously crafted ZIP archive containing
  file paths with `../` sequences, an attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on the
  system outside of the intended plugin directory. This can lead to remote code execution
  (RCE), privilege escalation, persistence, or denial of service.\n**✅ After investigation,
  it is confirmed that no plugins on the [Catalog](https://plugins.traefik.io/plugins)
  were affected. There is no known impact.**"
