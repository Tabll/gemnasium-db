package_slug: "go/github.com/traefik/traefik/v2"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "Traefik is an open source HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer. When
  a request is sent to Traefik with a URL fragment, Traefik automatically URL encodes
  and forwards the fragment to the backend server. This violates RFC 7230 because
  in the origin-form the URL should only contain the absolute path and the query.
  When this is combined with another frontend proxy like Nginx, it can be used to
  bypass frontend proxy URI-based access control restrictions. This vulnerability
  has been addressed in versions 2.10.6 and 3.0.0-beta5. Users are advised to upgrade.
  There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
