title: "Path Normalization Bypass in Traefik Router + Middleware Rules"
description: "There is a potential vulnerability in Traefik managing the requests
  using a `PathPrefix`, `Path` or `PathRegex` matcher.\n\nWhen Traefik is configured
  to route the requests to a backend using a matcher based on the path; if the request
  path contains an encoded restricted character from the following set **('/', '\\',
  'Null', ';', '?', '#')**, it’s possible to target a backend, exposed using another
  router, by-passing the middlewares chain.\n\nAccess Control Bypass:\nAny endpoint
  intended to be blocked (e.g., admin/debug/beta APIs) can be accessed by URL-encoding
  slashes or other characters.\n\nThis could lead to:\n\n- Unauthorized access to
  restricted endpoints\n- Execution of protected internal functionality\n- Potential
  privilege escalation\n- Bypass of security policies enforced via Traefik routing
  rules\n</details>"
