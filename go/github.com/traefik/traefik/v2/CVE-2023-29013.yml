title: "Traefik HTTP header parsing could cause a denial of service "
description: "### Impact\n\nThere is a vulnerability in [Go when parsing the HTTP
  headers](https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/Xdv6JL9ENs8/m/OV40vnafAwAJ),
  which impacts Traefik.\nHTTP header parsing could allocate substantially more memory
  than required to hold the parsed headers. This behavior could be exploited to cause
  a denial of service.\n\n### References\n\n- [CVE-2023-24534](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-24534)\n\n###
