title: "URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')"
description: "In Traefik before versions 1.7.26, 2.2.8, and 2.3.0-rc3, there exists
  a potential open redirect vulnerability in Traefik's handling of the \"X-Forwarded-Prefix\"
  header. The Traefik API dashboard component doesn't validate that the value of the
  header \"X-Forwarded-Prefix\" is a site relative path and will redirect to any header
  provided URI. Successful exploitation of an open redirect can be used to entice
  victims to disclose sensitive information. Active Exploitation of this issue is
  unlikely as it would require active header injection, however the Traefik team addressed
  this issue nonetheless to prevent abuse in e.g. cache poisoning scenarios."
