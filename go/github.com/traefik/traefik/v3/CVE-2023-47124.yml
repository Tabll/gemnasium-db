title: "Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime"
description: "Traefik is an open source HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer. When
  Traefik is configured to use the `HTTPChallenge` to generate and renew the Let's
  Encrypt TLS certificates, the delay authorized to solve the challenge (50 seconds)
  can be exploited by attackers to achieve a `slowloris attack`. This vulnerability
  has been patch in version 2.10.6 and 3.0.0-beta5. Users are advised to upgrade.
  Users unable to upgrade should replace the `HTTPChallenge` with the `TLSChallenge`
  or the `DNSChallenge`."
