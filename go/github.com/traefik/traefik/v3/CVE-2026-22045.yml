title: "Traefik's ACME TLS-ALPN fast path lacks timeouts and close on handshake stall"
description: "- Affected code: `pkg/server/router/tcp/router.go` (ACME TLS-ALPN handling).\n-
  When a ClientHello advertises `acme-tls/1`, Traefik intercepts it and calls `tls.Server(...).Handshake()`
  without any read/write deadlines and without closing the connection afterward.\n-
  Immediately before this branch, existing deadlines set by the entrypoint are cleared.\n-
  A client that sends the ALPN marker and then stops responding can keep the goroutine
  and socket open indefinitely, potentially exhausting the entrypoint under load.\n-
  Exposure is limited to entrypoints where the ACME TLS-ALPN challenge is enabled
  and ACME bypass is not allowed."
