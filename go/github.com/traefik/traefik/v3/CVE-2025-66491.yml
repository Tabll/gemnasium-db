title: "Traefik Inverted TLS Verification Logic in ingress-nginx Provider"
description: "A logic error in Traefik's experimental ingress-nginx provider inverts
  the semantics of the `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-ssl-verify` annotation.
  Setting the annotation to `\"on\"` (intending to enable backend TLS certificate
  verification) actually disables verification, allowing man-in-the-middle attacks
  against HTTPS backends when operators believe they are protected."
