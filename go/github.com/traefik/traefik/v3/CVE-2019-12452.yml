description: "types/types.go in Containous Traefik 1.7.x through 1.7.11, when the
  --api flag is used and the API is publicly reachable and exposed without sufficient
  access control (which is contrary to the API documentation), allows remote authenticated
  users to discover password hashes by reading the Basic HTTP Authentication or Digest
  HTTP Authentication section, or discover a key by reading the ClientTLS section.
  These can be found in the JSON response to a /api request."
