title: "Traefik: TCP readTimeout bypass via STARTTLS on Postgres"
description: "A remote, unauthenticated client can bypass Traefik entrypoint `respondingTimeouts.readTimeout`
  by sending the 8-byte Postgres SSLRequest (STARTTLS) prelude and then stalling,
  causing connections to remain open indefinitely and enabling file-descriptor and
  goroutine exhaustion denial of service.\n\nThis triggers during protocol detection
  **before routing**, so it is reachable on an entrypoint even when **no Postgres/TCP
  routers are configured** (the PoC uses only an HTTP router)."
