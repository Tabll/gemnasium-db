title: "Traefik has a possible vulnerability with the path matchers"
description: "There is a potential vulnerability in Traefik managing the requests
  using a `PathPrefix`, `Path` or `PathRegex` matcher.\n\nWhen Traefik is configured
  to route the requests to a backend using a matcher based on the path, if the URL
  contains a `/../` in its path, it’s possible to target a backend, exposed using
  another router, by-passing the middlewares chain."
