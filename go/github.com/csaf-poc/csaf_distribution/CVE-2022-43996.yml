description: "The csaf_provider package before 0.8.2 allows XSS via a crafted CSAF
  document uploaded as text/html. The endpoint upload allows valid CSAF advisories
  (JSON format) to be uploaded with Content-Type text/html and filenames ending in
  .html. When subsequently accessed via web browser, these advisories are served and
  interpreted as HTML pages. Such uploaded advisories can contain JavaScript code
  that will execute within the browser context of users inspecting the advisory."
