title: "Unauthenticated Admission Webhook Endpoints in Yoke ATC"
description: "Yoke ATC implements multiple Admission Webhook endpoints (`/validations/{airway}`,
  `/validations/resources`, `/validations/flights.yoke.cd`, `/validations/airways.yoke.cd`,
  etc.) that process AdmissionReview requests. These endpoints do not implement TLS
  client certificate authentication or request source validation. Any client that
  can reach the ATC service within the cluster can send requests directly to these
  endpoints, bypassing the Kubernetes API Server's authentication and authorization
  mechanisms."
