title: "Arbitrary WASM Code Execution via AnnotationOverrideFlight Injection in Yoke
  ATC"
description: "Yoke ATC allows users to override the Flight WASM module URL via the
  `overrides.yoke.cd/flight` annotation on Custom Resources. The controller only checks
  if the user has `update` permission on `airways` resources but does not validate
  the WASM URL source. An attacker with CR create/update permissions can inject a
  malicious WASM URL, causing the ATC controller to download and execute arbitrary
  code."
