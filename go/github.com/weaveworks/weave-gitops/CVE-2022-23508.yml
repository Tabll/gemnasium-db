title: "Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory"
description: "Weave GitOps is a simple open source developer platform for people who
  want cloud native applications, without needing Kubernetes expertise. A vulnerability
  in GitOps run could allow a local user or process to alter a Kubernetes cluster's
  resources. GitOps run has a local S3 bucket which it uses for synchronizing files
  that are later applied against a Kubernetes cluster. Its endpoint had no security
  controls to block unauthorized access, therefore allowing local users (and processes)
  on the same machine to see and alter the bucket content. By leveraging this vulnerability,
  an attacker could pick a workload of their choosing and inject it into the S3 bucket,
  which resulted in the successful deployment in the target cluster, without the need
  to provide any credentials to either the S3 bucket nor the target Kubernetes cluster.
  There are no known workarounds for this issue, please upgrade. This vulnerability
  has been fixed by commits 75268c4 and 966823b. Users should upgrade to Weave GitOps
  version >= v0.12.0 released on 08/12/2022. ### Workarounds There is no workaround
  for this vulnerability. ### References Disclosed by Paulo Gomes, Senior Software
