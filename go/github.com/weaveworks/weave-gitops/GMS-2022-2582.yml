package_slug: "go/github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops"
title: "Weave GitOps leaked cluster credentials into logs on connection errors"
description: "### Impact\nA vulnerability in the logging of Weave GitOps could allow
  an authenticated remote attacker to view sensitive cluster configurations, aka KubeConfg,
  of registered Kubernetes clusters, including the service account tokens in plain
  text from Weave GitOps's pod logs on the management cluster. An unauthorized remote
  attacker can also view these sensitive configurations from external log storage
  if enabled by the management cluster.\n\nThis vulnerability is due to the client
  factory dumping cluster configurations and their service account tokens when the
  cluster manager tries to connect to an API server of a registered cluster, and a
  connection error occurs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by either
  accessing logs of a pod of Weave GitOps, or from external log storage and obtaining
  all cluster configurations of registered clusters.\n\nA successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to use those cluster configurations to manage the registered
  Kubernetes clusters.\n\n### Patches\nThis vulnerability has been fixed by commit
  567356f471353fb5c676c77f5abc2a04631d50ca. Users should upgrade to Weave GitOps core
  version >= v0.8.1-rc.6 released on 31/05/2022.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere is no workaround
  for this vulnerability.\n\n### References\nDisclosed by Stefan Prodan, Principal
  Engineer, Weaveworks.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or
  comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Weave GitOps repository](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops)\n*
