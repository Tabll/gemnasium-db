package_slug: "go/github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops"
title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "Weave GitOps is a simple open source developer platform for people who
  want cloud native applications, without needing Kubernetes expertise. GitOps run
  has a local S3 bucket which it uses for synchronizing files that are later applied
  against a Kubernetes cluster. The communication between GitOps Run and the local
  S3 bucket is not encrypted. This allows privileged users or process to tap the local
  traffic to gain information permitting access to the s3 bucket. From that point,
  it would be possible to alter the bucket content, resulting in changes in the Kubernetes
  cluster's resources. There are no known workaround(s) for this vulnerability. This
  vulnerability has been fixed by commits ce2bbff and babd915. Users should upgrade
  to Weave GitOps version >= v0.12.0 released on 08/12/2022."
