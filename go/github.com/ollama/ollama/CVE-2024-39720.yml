description: "An issue was discovered in Ollama before 0.1.46. An attacker can use
  two HTTP requests to upload a malformed GGUF file containing just 4 bytes starting
  with the GGUF custom magic header. By leveraging a custom Modelfile that includes
  a FROM statement pointing to the attacker-controlled blob file, the attacker can
  crash the application through the CreateModel route, leading to a segmentation fault
  (signal SIGSEGV: segmentation violation)."
