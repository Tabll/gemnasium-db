package_slug: "go/github.com/bblfsh/bblfshd"
title: "Path Traversal"
description: "bblfshd is an open source self-hosted server for source code parsing.
  In bblfshd there is a zipslip
  vulnerability. The unsafe handling of symbolic links in an unpacking routine may
  enable attackers to read and/or write to arbitrary locations outside the designated
  target folder. This issue may lead to arbitrary file write (with same permissions
  as the program running the unpack operation) if the attacker can control the archive
  file."
