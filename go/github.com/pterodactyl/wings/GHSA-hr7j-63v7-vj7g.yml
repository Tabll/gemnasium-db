title: "Pterodactyl Panel's SFTP sessions remain active after user account deletion
  or password change"
description: "Deleting a user account with SFTP access or changing the user's password
  does not immediately terminate existing SFTP sessions, allowing continued filesystem
  access after credentials are revoked.\nThis can result in unintended and unauthorized
  access to server files even after administrators believe access has been fully invalidated."
