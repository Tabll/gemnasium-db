description: "An authenticated user who has access to a game server is able to bypass
  the previously implemented access control (https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings/security/advisories/GHSA-6rg3-8h8x-5xfv)
  that prevents accessing internal endpoints of the node hosting Wings in the pull
  endpoint. This would allow malicious users to potentially access resources on local
  networks that would otherwise be inaccessible."
