title: "Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')"
description: "Wings is Pterodactyl's server control plane. This vulnerability can
  be used to delete files and directories recursively on the host system. This vulnerability
  can be combined with `GHSA-p8r3-83r8-jwj5` to overwrite files on the host system.
  In order to use this exploit, an attacker must have an existing \"server\" allocated
  and controlled by Wings. This vulnerability has been resolved in version `v1.11.4`
  of Wings, and has been back-ported to the 1.7 release series in `v1.7.4`. Anyone
  running `v1.11.x` should upgrade to `v1.11.4` and anyone running `v1.7.x` should
  upgrade to `v1.7.4`. There are no known workarounds for this issue."
