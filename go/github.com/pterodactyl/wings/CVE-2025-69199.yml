identifiers:

- "GHSA-8w7m-w749-rx98"
package_slug: "go/github.com/pterodactyl/wings"
title: "Pterodactyl websocket endpoints have no visible rate limits or monitoring,
  allowing for DOS attacks"
description: "Websockets within wings lack proper rate limiting and throttling. As
  a result a malicious user can open a large number of connections and then request
  data through these sockets, causing an excessive volume of data over the network
  and overloading the host system memory and cpu.\n\nAdditionally, there is not a
  limit applied to the total size of messages being sent or received, allowing a malicious
  user to open thousands of websocket connections and then send massive volumes of
  information over the socket, overloading the host network, and causing increased
  CPU and memory load within Wings."
