title: "Unchecked hostname resolution could allow access to local network resources
  by users outside the local network"
description: "### Impact\nA newly implemented route allowing users to download files
  from remote endpoints was not properly verifying the destination hostname for user
  provided URLs. This would allow malicious users to potentially access resources
  on local networks that would otherwise be inaccessible.\n\nThis vulnerability requires
  valid authentication credentials and is therefore **not exploitable by unauthenticated
  users**. If you are running an instance for yourself or other trusted individuals
  this impact is unlikely to be of major concern to you. However, you should still
  upgrade for security sake.\n\n### Patches\nUsers should upgrade to the latest version
  of Wings.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere is no workaround available that does not involve
  modifying Panel or Wings code.\n"
