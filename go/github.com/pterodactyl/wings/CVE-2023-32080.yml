title: "Execution with Unnecessary Privileges"
description: "Wings is the server control plane for Pterodactyl Panel. A vulnerability
  affecting versions prior to 1.7.5 and versions 1.11.0 prior to 1.11.6 impacts anyone
  running the affected versions of Wings. This vulnerability can be used to gain access
  to the host system running Wings if a user is able to modify an server's install
  script or the install script executes code supplied by the user (either through
  environment variables, or commands that execute commands based off of user data).
  This vulnerability has been resolved in version `v1.11.6` of Wings, and has been
  back-ported to the 1.7 release series in `v1.7.5`. Anyone running `v1.11.x` should
  upgrade to `v1.11.6` and anyone running `v1.7.x` should upgrade to `v1.7.5`.\n\nThere
  are no workarounds aside from upgrading. Running Wings with a rootless container
  runtime may mitigate the severity of any attacks, however the majority of users
  are using container runtimes that run as root as per the Wings documentation. SELinux
  may prevent attackers from performing certain operations against the host system,
  however privileged containers have a lot of freedom even on systems with SELinux
  enabled.\n\nIt should be noted that this was a known attack vector, for attackers
  to easily exploit this attack it would require compromising an administrator account
  on a Panel. However, certain eggs (the data structure that holds the install scripts
  that get passed to Wings) have an issue where they are unknowingly executing shell
  commands with escalated privileges provided by untrusted user data."
