title: "NeuVector admin account has insecure default password"
description: "A vulnerability exists in NeuVector versions up to and including **5.4.5**,
  where a fixed string is used as the default password for the built-in `admin` account.
  If this password is not changed immediately after deployment, any workload with
  network access within the cluster could use the default credentials to obtain an
  authentication token. This token can then be used to perform any operation via NeuVector
  APIs.\n\nIn earlier versions, NeuVector supports setting the default (bootstrap)
  password for the `admin` account using a Kubernetes Secret named `neuvector-bootstrap-secret`.
  This Secret must contain a key named `bootstrapPassword`. However, if NeuVector
  fails to retrieve this value, it falls back to the fixed default password."
