title: "NeuVector OpenID Connect is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM)"
description: "NeuVector supports login authentication through OpenID Connect. However,
  the TLS verification (which verifies the remote server's authenticity and integrity)
  for OpenID Connect is not enforced by default. As a result this may expose the system
  to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.\nStarting from version 5.4.0, NeuVector supports
  TLS verification for following connection types:\n\n- Registry Connections\n- Auth
  Server Connections (SAML, LDAP and OIDC)\n- Webhook Connections\n\nBy default, TLS
  verification remains disabled, and its configuration is located under **Settings
  > Configuration in the NeuVector UI**.\n\nIn the patched version, the new NeuVector
  deployment enables TLS verification by default.\nFor rolling upgrades, NeuVector
  does not automatically change this setting to prevent disruptions.\n\n**Note:**
  When \"TLS verification\" is enabled, it affects all connections to:\n\n- Registry
  servers\n- Auth servers (SAML, LDAP and OIDC)\n- Webhook servers"
