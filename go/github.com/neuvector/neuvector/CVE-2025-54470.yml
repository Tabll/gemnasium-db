title: "NeuVector telemetry sender is vulnerable to MITM and DoS"
description: "This vulnerability affects NeuVector deployments only when the `Report
  anonymous cluster data option` is enabled. When this option is enabled, NeuVector
  sends anonymous telemetry data to the telemetry server at `https://upgrades.neuvector-upgrade-responder.livestock.rancher.io`.\n\nIn
  affected versions, NeuVector does not enforce TLS certificate verification when
  transmitting anonymous cluster data to the telemetry server. As a result, the communication
  channel is susceptible to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where an attacker could
  intercept or modify the transmitted data. Additionally, NeuVector loads the response
  of the telemetry server is loaded into memory without size limitation, which makes
  \ it vulnerable to a Denial of Service(DoS) attack.\n\nThe patched version includes
  the following security improvements:\n- NeuVector now verifies the telemetry server’s
  `TLS certificate chain` and `hostname` during the handshake process. This ensures
  that all telemetry communications occur over a trusted and verified channel.\n-
  NeuVector limits the telemetry server’s response to `256 bytes`, mitigating the
  risk of memory exhaustion and DoS attacks.\n\nThese security enhancements are enabled
  by default and require no user action."
