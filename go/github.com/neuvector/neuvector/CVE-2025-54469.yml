title: "NeuVector Enforcer is vulnerable to Command Injection and Buffer overflow"
description: "A vulnerability was identified in NeuVector, where the enforcer used
  environment variables `CLUSTER_RPC_PORT` and `CLUSTER_LAN_PORT` to generate a command
  to be executed via `popen`, without first sanitising their values.\n\nThe entry
  process of the enforcer container is the monitor process. When the enforcer container
  stops, the monitor process checks whether the consul subprocess has exited. To perform
  this check, the monitor process uses the `popen` function to execute a shell command
  that determines whether the ports used by the consul subprocess are still active.\n\nThe
  values of environment variables `CLUSTER_RPC_PORT` and `CLUSTER_LAN_PORT` are used
  directly to compose shell commands via popen without validation or sanitization.
  \ This behavior could allow a malicious user to inject malicious commands through
  these variables within the enforcer container.\n\nIn the patched version, the monitor
  process validates the values of `CLUSTER_RPC_PORT` and `CLUSTER_LAN_PORT` to ensure
  they contain only valid port numbers before invoking the `popen` command.\n\nIf
  validation fails, the monitor process exits immediately, causing the enforcer container
  to terminate. This prevents the execution of any injected or malicious commands."
