title: "NeuVector is shipping cryptographic material into its binary"
description: "NeuVector used a hard-coded cryptographic key embedded in the source
  code. At compilation time, the key value was replaced with the secret key value
  and used to encrypt sensitive configurations  when NeuVector stores the data.\n\nIn
  the patched version, NeuVector leverages the Kubernetes secret `neuvector-store-secret`
  in `neuvector` namespace to dynamically generate cryptographically secure random
  keys. This approach removes the reliance on static key values and ensures that encryption
  keys are managed securely within Kubernetes.\n\nDuring rolling upgrade or restoring
  from persistent storage, the NeuVector controller checks each encrypted configured
  field. If a sensitive field in the configuration is found to be encrypted by the
  default encryption key, it’s decrypted with the default encryption key and then
  re-encrypted with the new dynamic encryption key.\n\nIf the NeuVector controller
  does not have the correct RBAC for accessing the new secret, it writes this error
  log :\n`Required Kubernetes RBAC for secrets are not found` and exits.\n\nThe device
  encryption key is rotated every 3 months. For details, please refer to this [Rotating
  Self-Signed Certificate](https://open-docs.neuvector.com/configuration/console/certrotate)
  documentation."
