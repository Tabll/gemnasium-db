title: "NeuVector process with sensitive arguments lead to leakage"
description: "When a Java command with password parameters is executed and terminated
  by NeuVector for Process rule violation. For example,\n\n```\njava -cp /app ...
  Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=<Password>\n```\n\nThe command with the password
  appears in the NeuVector security event. To prevent this, NeuVector uses the following
  default regular expression to detect and redact sensitive data from process commands:\n\n```\n(?i)(password|passwd|token)\n```\n\nAlso,
  you can define custom patterns to redact by creating a Kubernetes ConfigMap. For
  example:\n\n```\nkubectl create configmap neuvector-custom-rules --from-file=secret-patterns.yaml
  -n neuvector\n```\n\nSample `secret-patterns.yaml` content:\n\n```\nPattern_list:\n-
  (?i)(pawd|pword)\n- (?i)(secret)\n```\n\nNeuVector uses the default and custom regex
  to decide whether the process command in a security event should be redacted.\n\n**Note:**
  If numerous regular expression (regex) patterns are configured in the Kubernetes
  ConfigMap for extended coverage of sensitive data matching, it can significantly
  impact performance of NeuVector enforcer, particularly in scenarios involving large
  inputs or frequent execution. The primary factor contributing to performance issues
  in regex is backtracking, where the regex engine attempts various matching paths
  when a pattern doesn't immediately find a match."
