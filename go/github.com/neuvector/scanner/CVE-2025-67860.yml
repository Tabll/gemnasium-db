identifiers:
- "CVE-2025-67860"
- "GHSA-3c9m-gq32-g4jx"
package_slug: "go/github.com/neuvector/scanner"
title: "NeuVector scanner insecurely handles passwords as command arguments"
description: "A vulnerability has been identified in the NeuVector scanner where the
  scanner process accepts registry and controller credentials as command-line arguments,
  potentially exposing sensitive credentials to local users. This may allow unauthorized
  access to registries or the NeuVector controller, potentially enabling image manipulation,
  information disclosure, or further lateral movement within the environment.\n\n**Important:**\n-
  For the exposure of credentials not related to Rancher NeuVector, the final impact
  severity for confidentiality, integrity and availability is dependent on the permissions
  the leaked credentials have on their services.\n- It is recommended to review for
  potentially leaked credentials in this scenario and to change them if deemed necessary.\n\nPlease
  consult the associated [MITRE ATT&CK – Technique – Credential Access and Unsecured
  Credentials](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/) for further information
  about this category of attack."
