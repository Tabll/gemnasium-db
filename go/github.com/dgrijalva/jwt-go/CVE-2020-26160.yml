package_slug: "go/github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go"
title: "Missing Authorization"
description: "jwt-go allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions in situations
  with `[]string{}` for `m[\"aud\"]` (which is allowed by the specification). Because
  the type assertion fails, \"\" is the value of `aud`. This is a security problem
  if the JWT token is presented to a service that lacks its own audience check."
