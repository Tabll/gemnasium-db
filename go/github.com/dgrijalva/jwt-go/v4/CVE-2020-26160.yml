package_slug: "go/github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go/v4"
title: "Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions"
description: "jwt-go before 4.0.0-preview1 allows attackers to bypass intended access
  restrictions in situations with []string{} for m[\"aud\"] (which is allowed by the
  specification). Because the type assertion fails, \"\" is the value of aud. This
  is a security problem if the JWT token is presented to a service that lacks its
  own audience check."
