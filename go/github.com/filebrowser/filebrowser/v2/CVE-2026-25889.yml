title: "File Browser has an Authentication Bypass in User Password Update"
description: "A case-sensitivity flaw in the password validation logic allows any
  authenticated user to change their password (or an admin to change any user's password)
  **without providing the current password**. By using Title Case field name `\"Password\"`
  instead of lowercase `\"password\"` in the API request, the `current_password` verification
  is completely bypassed. This enables account takeover if an attacker obtains a valid
  JWT token through XSS, session hijacking, or other means.\n\n**CVSS Score**: 7.5
  (High)\n**CWE**: CWE-178 (Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity)\n\n---"
