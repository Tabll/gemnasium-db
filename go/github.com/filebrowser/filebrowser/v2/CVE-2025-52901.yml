title: "File Browser allows sensitive data to be transferred in URL"
description: "URLs that are accessed by a user are commonly logged in many locations,
  both server- and client-side. It is thus good practice to never transmit any secret
  information as part of a URL. The *Filebrowser* violates this practice, since access
  tokens are used as GET parameters."
