title: "File Browser has risk of HTTP Request/Response smuggling through vulnerable
  dependency"
description: "The standard library `net/http` package dependency used by File Browser
  improperly accepts a bare LF as a line terminator in chunked data chunk-size lines.
  I can permit request smuggling if a net/http server is used in conjunction with
  a server that incorrectly accepts a bare LF as part of a chunk-ext.\n\nSee https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-22871
