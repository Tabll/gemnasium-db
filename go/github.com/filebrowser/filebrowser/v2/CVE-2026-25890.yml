title: "File Browser has a Path-Based Access Control Bypass via Multiple Leading Slashes
  in URL"
description: "An authenticated user can bypass the application's \"Disallow\" file
  path rules by modifying the request URL. By adding multiple slashes (e.g., //private/)
  to the path, the authorization check fails to match the rule, while the underlying
  filesystem resolves the path correctly, granting unauthorized access to restricted
  files."
