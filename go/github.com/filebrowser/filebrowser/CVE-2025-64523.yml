title: "File Browser is Vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in Share
  Deletion Function"
description: "It has been found an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability
  in the FileBrowser application's share deletion functionality. This vulnerability
  allows any authenticated user with share permissions to delete other users' shared
  links without authorization checks.\n\nThe impact is significant as malicious actors
  can disrupt business operations by systematically removing shared files and links.
  This leads to denial of service for legitimate users, potential data loss in collaborative
  environments, and breach of data confidentiality agreements. In organizational settings,
  this could affect critical file sharing for projects, presentations, or document
  collaboration."
