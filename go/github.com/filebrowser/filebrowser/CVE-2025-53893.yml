title: "File Browser's Uncontrolled Memory Consumption vulnerability can enable DoS
  attack due to oversized file processing"
description: "A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the file processing
  logic when reading a file on endpoint  `Filebrowser-Server-IP:PORT/files/{file-name}`
  . While the server correctly handles and stores uploaded files, it attempts to load
  the entire content into memory during read operations without size checks or resource
  limits. This allows an authenticated user to upload a large file and trigger uncontrolled
  memory consumption on read, potentially crashing the server and making it unresponsive."
