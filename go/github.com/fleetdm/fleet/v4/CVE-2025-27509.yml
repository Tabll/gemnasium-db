title: "Fleet has SAML authentication vulnerability due to improper SAML response
  validation"
description: "In vulnerable versions of Fleet, an attacker could craft a specially-formed
  SAML response to:\n\n- Forge authentication assertions, potentially impersonating
  legitimate users.\n- If Just-In-Time (JIT) provisioning is enabled, the attacker
  could provision a new administrative user account.\n- If MDM enrollment is enabled,
  certain endpoints could be used to create new accounts tied to forged assertions.\n\nThis
  could allow unauthorized access to Fleet, including administrative access, visibility
  into device data, and modification of configuration."
