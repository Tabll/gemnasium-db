title: "Fleet Windows MDM endpoint has a Cross-site Scripting vulnerability"
description: "If Windows MDM is enabled, an attacker could exploit a cross-site scripting
  (XSS) vulnerability by convincing an authenticated Fleet user to visit a malicious
  link. Successful exploitation could allow retrieval of the user’s Fleet authentication
  token from their browser.\n\nA compromised authentication token may grant administrative
  access to the Fleet API, allowing an attacker to perform privileged actions such
  as deploying scripts to managed hosts.\n\nThis issue does not allow unauthenticated
  access and does not affect instances where Windows MDM is disabled."
