package_slug: "go/github.com/flyteorg/flyteadmin/auth/authzserver"
title: "Insufficient Session Expiration"
description: "FlyteAdmin is the control plane for Flyte responsible for managing entities
  and administering workflow executions. In versions 1.1.30 and prior, authenticated
  users using an external identity provider can continue to use Access Tokens and
  ID Tokens even after they expire. Users who use FlyteAdmin as the OAuth2 Authorization
  Server are unaffected by this issue. A patch is available on the `master` branch
  of the repository. As a workaround, rotating signing keys immediately will invalidate
  all open sessions and force all users to attempt to obtain new tokens. Those who
  use this workaround should continue to rotate keys until FlyteAdmin has been upgraded
  and hide FlyteAdmin deployment ingress URL from the internet."
