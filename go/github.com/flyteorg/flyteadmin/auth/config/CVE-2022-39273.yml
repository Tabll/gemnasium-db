package_slug: "go/github.com/flyteorg/flyteadmin/auth/config"
title: "Use of Hard-coded Credentials"
description: "FlyteAdmin is the control plane for the data processing platform Flyte.
  Users who enable the default Flyte’s authorization server without changing the default
  clientid hashes will be exposed to the public internet. In an effort to make enabling
  authentication easier for Flyte administrators, the default configuration for Flyte
  Admin allows access for Flyte Propeller even after turning on authentication via
  a hardcoded hashed password. This password is also set on the default Flyte Propeller
  configmap in the various Flyte Helm charts. Users who enable auth but do not override
  this setting in Flyte Admin’s configuration may unbeknownst to them be allowing
  public traffic in by way of this default password with attackers effectively impersonating
  propeller. This only applies to users who have not specified the ExternalAuthorizationServer
  setting. Usage of an external auth server automatically turns off this default configuration
  and are not susceptible to this vulnerability. This issue has been addressed in
  version 1.1.44. Users should manually set the staticClients in the selfAuthServer
  section of their configuration if they intend to rely on Admin’s internal auth server.
  Again, users who use an external auth server are automatically protected from this
  vulnerability."
