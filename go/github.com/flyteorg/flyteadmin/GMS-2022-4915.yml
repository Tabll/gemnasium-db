package_slug: "go/github.com/flyteorg/flyteadmin"
title: "FlyteAdmin's Default OAuth Authorization Server secret must be rotated"
description: "Users who enable the default Flyte’s authorization server without changing 
  the default clientid hashes will be exposed to the public internet. In an effort to 
  make enabling authentication easier for Flyte administrators, the default
  configuration for Flyte Admin allows access for Flyte Propeller even after turning
  on authentication via a hardcoded hashed password. This password is also set on
  the default Flyte Propeller configmap in the various Flyte Helm charts. Users who
  enable auth but do not override this setting in Flyte Admin’s configuration may
  unknowingly allow public traffic in by way of this default password with attackers
  effectively impersonating propeller. This only applies to users who have not specified
  the ExternalAuthorizationServer setting. Using an external auth server automatically
  turns off this default configuration is not susceptible to this vulnerability."
