title: "Evmos vulnerable to unauthorized account creation with vesting module"
description: "_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nUsing the vesting
  module, a malicious attacker can create a new vesting account at a given\naddress,
  before a contract is created on that address.\n\nAddresses of smart contracts deployed
  to the EVM are deterministic. Therefore, it would be possible for an attacker to
  front-run a contract creation and create a vesting account at that address.\nWhen
  an address has been initialized without any contract code deployed to it, it will
  not be possible to upload any afterwards. In the described attack, this would mean
  that a malicious actor could prevent smart contracts from being deployed correctly.\n\nIn
  order to remediate this, an alternative user flow is being implemented for the vesting
  module:\n- only the account receiving the vesting funds will be able to create such
  an account by calling the `CreateClawbackVestingAccount` method and defining a funder
  address\n- vesting and lockup periods can then be created by that funder address
  using `FundClawbackAccount`"
