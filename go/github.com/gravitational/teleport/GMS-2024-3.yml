title: "Teleport Proxy and Teleport Agents: SSRF to arbitrary hosts is possible from
  low privileged users"
description: "### Impact\nAn authenticated attacker with valid credentials (user or
  host) can make non-blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) through the proxy and/or
  agents to arbitrary hosts.\n\nDuring investigation of this functionality, it was
  discovered that there are several permutations where this SSRF is possible. This
  release addresses all but one: a root proxy administrator with access to the root
  proxy credentials can make requests through leaf proxies in Trusted Clusters. This
  behavior will be restricted in future releases. For customers using Teleport in
  a Trusted Cluster configuration, we encourage leaf clusters to have network restrictions
  in place to mitigate SSRF. For example, we recommend restricting outbound network
  connections to only the Auth Service, your SSO provider, and any agents, databases
  or applications needed to be accessed from the proxy. If running in a cloud environment
  pay careful attention to what cloud resources are accessible from the proxy.\n\n###
  Patches\nFixed in versions 14.2.4, 13.4.13 and 12.4.31.\n\n### Workarounds\nStrict
  network controls from the Teleport Proxy and Teleport Agents reduce the potential
  exposure from this issue.\n\n### References\n* Fixed in PR: https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/36127\n*
