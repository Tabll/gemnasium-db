title: "Withdrawn Advisory: Teleport Proxy and Teleport Agents: SSRF to arbitrary
  hosts is possible from low privileged users"
description: "An authenticated attacker with valid credentials (user or host) can
  make non-blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) through the proxy and/or agents
  to arbitrary hosts.\n\nDuring investigation of this functionality, it was discovered
  that there are several permutations where this SSRF is possible. This release addresses
  all but one: a root proxy administrator with access to the root proxy credentials
  can make requests through leaf proxies in Trusted Clusters. This behavior will be
  restricted in future releases. For customers using Teleport in a Trusted Cluster
  configuration, we encourage leaf clusters to have network restrictions in place
  to mitigate SSRF. For example, we recommend restricting outbound network connections
  to only the Auth Service, your SSO provider, and any agents, databases or applications
  needed to be accessed from the proxy. If running in a cloud environment pay careful
  attention to what cloud resources are accessible from the proxy."
