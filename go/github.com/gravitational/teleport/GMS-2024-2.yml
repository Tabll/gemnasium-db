title: "SFTP is possible on the Proxy server for any user with SFTP access"
description: "### Impact\nAn attacker that has access to nodes within the cluster
  may be able to SFTP to the Proxy Service. The user's permissions on the Proxy server
  are still respected, so files can only be read or modified on the Proxy if the user
  has system access to read or write to them.\n\n### Patches\nFixed in versions 14.2.4,
  13.4.13 and 12.4.31.\n\n### Workarounds\nThis issue can be mitigated by ensuring
  that regular users do not have a valid principal on the proxy server. To be exploitable,
  the user's login must exist on a proxy server and the Teleport binary must have
  permissions to start a session with this user.\n\n### References\n* Fix PR: https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/36136\n"
