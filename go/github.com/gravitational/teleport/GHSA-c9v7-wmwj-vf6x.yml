title: "Withdrawn Advisory: SFTP is possible on the Proxy server for any user with
  SFTP access"
description: "An attacker that has access to nodes within the cluster may be able
  to SFTP to the Proxy Service. The user's permissions on the Proxy server are still
  respected, so files can only be read or modified on the Proxy if the user has system
  access to read or write to them."
