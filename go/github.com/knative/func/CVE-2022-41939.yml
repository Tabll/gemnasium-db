title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "knative.dev/func is is a client library and CLI enabling the development
  and deployment of Kubernetes functions. Developers using a malicious or compromised
  third-party buildpack could expose their registry credentials or local docker socket
  to a malicious `lifecycle` container. This issues has been patched in PR #1442,
  and is part of release 1.8.1. This issue only affects users who are using function
  buildpacks from third-parties; pinning the builder image to a specific content-hash
  with a valid `lifecycle` image will also mitigate the attack."
