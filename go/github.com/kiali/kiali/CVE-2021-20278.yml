package_slug: "go/github.com/kiali/kiali"
title: "Authentication Bypass by Spoofing"
description: "An authentication bypass vulnerability was found in Kiali in versions
  before 1.31.0 when the authentication strategy `OpenID` is used. When RBAC is enabled,
  Kiali assumes that some of the token validation is handled by the underlying cluster.
  When OpenID `implicit flow` is used with RBAC turned off, this token validation
  doesn't occur, and this allows a malicious user to bypass the authentication."
