title: "Calico privilege escalation vulnerability"
description: "In vulnerable versions of Calico (v3.27.2 and below), Calico Enterprise
  (v3.19.0-1, v3.18.1, v3.17.3 and below), and Calico Cloud (v19.2.0 and below), an
  attacker who has local access to the Kubernetes node, can escalate their privileges
  by exploiting a vulnerability in the Calico CNI install binary. The issue arises
  from an incorrect SUID (Set User ID) bit configuration in the binary, combined with
  the ability to control the input binary, allowing an attacker to execute an arbitrary
  binary with elevated privileges."
