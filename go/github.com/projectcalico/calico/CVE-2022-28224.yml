title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "Clusters using Calico (version 3.22.1 and below), Calico Enterprise
  (version 3.12.0 and below), may be vulnerable to route hijacking with the floating
  IP feature. Due to insufficient validation, a privileged attacker may be able to
  set a floating IP annotation to a pod even if the feature is not enabled. This may
  allow the attacker to intercept and reroute traffic to their compromised pod."
