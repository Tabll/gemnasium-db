title: "ydb-go-sdk token in custom credentials object can leak through logs"
description: "ydb-go-sdk is a pure Go native and database/sql driver for the YDB platform.
  Since ydb-go-sdk v3.48.6 if you use a custom credentials object (implementation
  of interface Credentials it may leak into logs. This happens because this object
  could be serialized into an error message using `fmt.Errorf(\"something went wrong
  (credentials: %q)\", credentials)` during connection to the YDB server. If such
  logging occurred, a malicious user with access to logs could read sensitive information
  (i.e. credentials) information and use it to get access to the database. ydb-go-sdk
  contains this problem in versions from v3.48.6 to v3.53.2. The fix for this problem
  has been released in version v3.53.3. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable
  to upgrade should implement the `fmt.Stringer` interface in your custom credentials
  type with explicit stringify of object state."
