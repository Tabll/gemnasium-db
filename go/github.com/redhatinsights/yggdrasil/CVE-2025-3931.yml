title: "Yggdrasil Vulnerable to Local Privilege Escalation"
description: "A flaw was found in Yggdrasil, which acts as a system broker, allowing
  the processes to communicate to other children's \"worker\" processes through the
  DBus component. Yggdrasil creates a DBus method to dispatch messages to workers.
  However, it misses authentication and authorization checks, allowing every system
  user to call it. One available Yggdrasil worker acts as a package manager with capabilities
  to create and enable new repositories and install or remove packages.\n\nThis flaw
  allows an attacker with access to the system to leverage the lack of authentication
  on the dispatch message to force the Yggdrasil worker to install arbitrary RPM packages.
  This issue results in local privilege escalation, enabling the attacker to access
  and modify sensitive system data."
