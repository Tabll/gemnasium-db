title: "Infinite loop in github.com/gomarkdown/markdown"
description: "The package `github.com/gomarkdown/markdown` is a Go library for parsing
  Markdown text and rendering as HTML. Prior to pseudoversion `v0.0.0-20240729232818-a2a9c4f`,
  which corresponds with commit `a2a9c4f76ef5a5c32108e36f7c47f8d310322252`, there
  was a logical problem in the paragraph function of the parser/block.go file, which
  allowed a remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition by providing
  a tailor-made input that caused an infinite loop, causing the program to hang and
  consume resources indefinitely. Submit `a2a9c4f76ef5a5c32108e36f7c47f8d310322252`
  contains fixes to this problem."
