package_slug: "go/github.com/gomarkdown/markdown"
title: "Out-of-bounds Read"
description: "The package `github.com/gomarkdown/markdown` is a Go library for parsing
  Markdown text and rendering as HTML. Prior to pseudoversion `0.0.0-20230922105210-14b16010c2ee`,
  which corresponds with commit `14b16010c2ee7ff33a940a541d993bd043a88940`, parsing
  malformed markdown input with parser that uses parser.Mmark extension could result
  in out-of-bounds read vulnerability. To exploit the vulnerability, parser needs
  to have `parser.Mmark` extension set. The panic occurs inside the `citation.go`
  file on the line 69 when the parser tries to access the element past its length.
  This can result in a denial of service. Commit `14b16010c2ee7ff33a940a541d993bd043a88940`/pseudoversion
  `0.0.0-20230922105210-14b16010c2ee` contains a patch for this issue."
