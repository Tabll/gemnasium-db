title: "External Secrets Operator's Missing Namespace Restriction Allows Unauthorized
  Secret Access"
description: "A vulnerability was discovered in the External Secrets Operator where
  the `List()` calls for Kubernetes Secret and SecretStore resources performed by
  the `PushSecret` controller did not apply a namespace selector.\nThis flaw allowed
  an attacker to use label selectors to list and read secrets/secret-stores across
  the cluster, bypassing intended namespace restrictions.\n\n---"
