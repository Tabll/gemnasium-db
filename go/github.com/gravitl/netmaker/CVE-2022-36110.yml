title: "Incorrect Authorization"
description: "Netmaker makes networks with WireGuard. Prior to version 0.15.1, Improper
  Authorization functions lead to non-privileged users running privileged API calls.
  If someone adds users to the Netmaker platform who do not have admin privileges,

  has been patched in v0.15.1."
