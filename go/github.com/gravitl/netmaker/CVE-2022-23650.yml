title: "Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key in Netmaker"
description: "Netmaker is a platform for creating and managing virtual overlay networks
  using WireGuard. Prior to versions 0.8.5, 0.9.4, and 010.0, there is a hard-coded
  cryptographic key in the code base which can be exploited to run admin commands
  on a remote server if the exploiter know the address and username of the admin.
  This effects the server (netmaker) component, and not clients. This has been patched
  in Netmaker v0.8.5, v0.9.4, and v0.10.0. There are currently no known workarounds."
