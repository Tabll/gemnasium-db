title: "Denial of Service in github.com/graph-gophers/graphql-go"
description: "graphql-go is a GraphQL server with a focus on ease of use. there exists
  a DoS vulnerability that is possible due to a bug in the library that would allow
  an attacker with specifically designed queries to cause stack overflow panics. Any
  user with access to the GraphQL handler can send these queries and cause stack overflows.
  This in turn could potentially compromise the ability of the server to serve data
  to its users. The issue has been patched in version `v1.3.0`. The only known workaround
  for this issue is to disable the `graphql.MaxDepth` option from your schema which
  is not recommended."
