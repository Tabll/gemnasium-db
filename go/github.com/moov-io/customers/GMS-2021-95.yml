title: "accounts: Hash account number using Salt"
description: "@alovak found that currently when we build hash of account number we
  do not \"salt\" it. Which makes it vulnerable to rainbow table attack.\n\n**What
  did you expect to see?**\nI expected salt (some random number from configuration)
  to be used in [hash.AccountNumber](https://github.com/moov-io/customers/blob/master/pkg/secrets/hash/account_number.go#L13)\n\nI
  would generate salt per tenant at least (maybe per organization)."
