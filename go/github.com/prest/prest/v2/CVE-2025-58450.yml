title: "pREST has a Systemic SQL Injection Vulnerability"
description: "pREST provides a simple way for users to expose access their database
  via a REST-full API. The project is implemented using the Go programming language
  and is designed to expose access to Postgres database tables.\n\nDuring an independent
  review of the project, Doyensec engineers found that SQL injection is a systemic
  problem in the current implementation (version `v2.0.0-rc2`). Even though there
  are several instances of attempts to sanitize user input and mitigate injection
  attempts, we have found that on most code-paths, the protection is faulty or non-existent."
