title: "Blocklist Bypass possible via ECDSA Signature Malleability"
description: "When using P256 certificates (which is not the default configuration),
  it is possible to evade a blocklist entry created against the fingerprint of a certificate
  by using ECDSA Signature Malleability to use a copy of the certificate with a different
  fingerprint.\n\nIn order for this to affect a user or network, all of the following
  must be true:\n* `CURVE_P256` certificates are being used\n* There are one or more
  entries on the blocklist\n* The certificates for those entries are signed by a trusted
  CA and not expired\n* An attacker has a copy of the private key, and corresponding
  certificate, for one of those blocklist entries"
