package_slug: "go/github.com/opencontainers/runc"
title: "Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere"
description: "runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux according
  to the OCI specification. In runc 1.1.11 and earlier, due to an internal file descriptor
  leak, an attacker could cause a newly-spawned container process (from runc exec)
  to have a working directory in the host filesystem namespace, allowing for a container
  escape by giving access to the host filesystem (\"attack 2\"). The same attack could
  be used by a malicious image to allow a container process to gain access to the
  host filesystem through runc run (\"attack 1\"). Variants of attacks 1 and 2 could
  be also be used to overwrite semi-arbitrary host binaries, allowing for complete
  container escapes (\"attack 3a\" and \"attack 3b\"). runc 1.1.12 includes patches
  for this issue. "
