title: "Improper Preservation of Permissions"
description: "runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to
  the OCI specification. In affected versions it was found that rootless runc makes
  `/sys/fs/cgroup` writable in following conditons: 1. when runc is executed inside
  the user namespace, and the `config.json` does not specify the cgroup namespace
  to be unshared (e.g.., `(docker|podman|nerdctl) run --cgroupns=host`, with Rootless
  Docker/Podman/nerdctl) or 2. when runc is executed outside the user namespace, and
  `/sys` is mounted with `rbind, ro` (e.g., `runc spec --rootless`; this condition
  is very rare). A container may gain the write access to user-owned cgroup hierarchy
  `/sys/fs/cgroup/user.slice/...` on the host . Other user's cgroup hierarchies are
  not affected. Users are advised to upgrade to version 1.1.5. Users unable to upgrade
  may unshare the cgroup namespace (`(docker|podman|nerdctl) run --cgroupns=private)`.
  This is the default behavior of Docker/Podman/nerdctl on cgroup v2 hosts. or add
  `/sys/fs/cgroup` to `maskedPaths`."
