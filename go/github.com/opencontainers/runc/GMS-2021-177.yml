title: "Devices resource list treated as a denylist by default"
description: "Contrary to the 
  OCI runtime specification
  `runc`'s implementation of the `linux.resources.devices` list was a black-list by
  default. This means that users who created their own `config.json` objects and didn't
  prefix a deny-all rule (`{\"allow\": false, \"permissions\": \"rwm\"}` or equivalent)
  were not provided protection by the `devices` cgroup."
