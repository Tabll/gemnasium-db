title: "Incorrect Default Permissions"
description: "runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux according
  to the OCI specification. A bug was found in runc prior to version 1.1.2 where `runc
  exec --cap` created processes with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities,
  creating an atypical Linux environment and enabling programs with inheritable file
  capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during execve(2).
  This bug does not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never
  contained more capabilities than were included in the container's bounding set.
  This bug has been fixed in runc 1.1.2. This fix changes `runc exec --cap` behavior
  such that the additional capabilities granted to the process being executed (as
  specified via `--cap` arguments) do not include inheritable capabilities. In addition,
  `runc spec` is changed to not set any inheritable capabilities in the created example
  OCI spec (`config.json`) file."
