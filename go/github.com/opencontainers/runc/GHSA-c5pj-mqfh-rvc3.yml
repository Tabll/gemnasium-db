description: "## Withdrawn Advisory\n\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it
  was incorrectly attributed to runc. Please see the issue [here](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/4263)
  for more information.\n\n## Original Description\n\nA flaw was found in cri-o, where
  an arbitrary systemd property can be injected via a Pod annotation. Any user who
  can create a pod with an arbitrary annotation may perform an arbitrary action on
  the host system. This issue has its root in how runc handles Config Annotations
  lists."
