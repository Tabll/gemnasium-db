title: "Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')"
description: "The OCI Distribution Spec project defines an API protocol to facilitate
  and standardize the distribution of content. In the OCI Distribution Specification
  version 1.0.0 and prior, the Content-Type header alone was used to determine the
  type of document during push and pull operations. Documents that contain both “manifests”
  and “layers” fields could be interpreted as either a manifest or an index in the
  absence of an accompanying Content-Type header. If a Content-Type header changed
  between two pulls of the same digest, a client may interpret the resulting content
  differently. The OCI Distribution Specification has been updated to require that
  a mediaType value present in a manifest or index match the Content-Type header used
  during the push and pull operations. Clients pulling from a registry may distrust
  the Content-Type header and reject an ambiguous document that contains both “manifests”
  and “layers” fields or “manifests” and “config” fields if they are unable to update
  to version 1.0.1 of the spec."
