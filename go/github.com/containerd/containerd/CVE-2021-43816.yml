package_slug: "go/github.com/containerd/containerd"
title: "Improper Preservation of Permissions"
description: "containerd is an open source container runtime. On installations using
  SELinux, such as EL8 (CentOS, RHEL), Fedora, or SUSE MicroOS, with containerd as
  the backing container runtime interface (CRI), an unprivileged pod scheduled to
  the node may bind mount, via `hostPath` volume, any privileged, regular file on
  disk for complete read/write access (sans delete). Such is achieved by placing the
  in-container location of the `hostPath` volume mount at either `/etc/hosts`, `/etc/hostname`,
  or `/etc/resolv.conf`. These locations are being relabeled indiscriminately to match
  the container process-label which effectively elevates permissions for savvy containers
  that would not normally be able to access privileged host files. This issue has
  been resolved Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible."
