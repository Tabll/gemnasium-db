title: "Insufficiently Protected Credentials"
description: "Containerd (an industry-standard container runtime) suffers from a credential
  leaking vulnerability. If a container image manifest in the `OCI Image` format or
  `Docker Image V2 Schema 2` format includes a URL for the location of a specific
  image layer (otherwise known as a “foreign layer”), the default containerd resolver
  will follow that URL to attempt to download it. The default containerd resolver
  will provide its authentication credentials if the server where the URL is located
  presents an HTTP status code along with registry-specific HTTP headers. If an attacker
  publishes a public image with a manifest that directs one of the layers to be fetched
  from a web server they control, and they trick a user or system into pulling the
  image, they could obtain the credentials used for pulling that image. In some cases,
  this may be the user's username and password for the registry. In other cases, this
  may be the credentials attached to the cloud virtual instance which can grant access
  to other cloud resources in the account. The default containerd resolver is used
  by the `cri-containerd` plugin (which can be used by Kubernetes), the `ctr` development
  tool, and other client programs that have explicitly linked against it. Other container
  runtimes built on top of containerd but not using the default resolver (such as
  Docker) are not affected."
