package_slug: "go/github.com/containerd/containerd"
title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "containerd is an open source container runtime with an emphasis on simplicity,
  robustness and portability. A bug was found in containerd where container root directories
  and some plugins had insufficiently restricted permissions, allowing otherwise unprivileged
  Linux users to traverse directory contents and execute programs. When containers
  included executable programs with extended permission bits (such as setuid), unprivileged
  Linux users could discover and execute those programs. When the UID of an unprivileged
  Linux user on the host collided with the file owner or group inside a container,
  the unprivileged Linux user on the host could discover, read, and modify those files."
