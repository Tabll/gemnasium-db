title: "OCI image importer memory exhaustion in github.com/containerd/containerd"
description: "containerd is an open source container runtime. Before versions 1.6.18
  and 1.5.18, when importing an OCI image, there was no limit on the number of bytes
  read for certain files. A maliciously crafted image with a large file where a limit
  was not applied could cause a denial of service. This bug has been fixed in containerd
  1.6.18 and 1.5.18. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue. As
  a workaround, ensure that only trusted images are used and that only trusted users
  have permissions to import images."
