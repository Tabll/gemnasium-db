title: "containerd has an integer overflow in User ID handling"
description: "A bug was found in containerd where containers launched with a User
  set as a `UID:GID` larger than the maximum 32-bit signed integer can cause an overflow
  condition where the container ultimately runs as root (UID 0). This could cause
  unexpected behavior for environments that require containers to run as a non-root
  user."
