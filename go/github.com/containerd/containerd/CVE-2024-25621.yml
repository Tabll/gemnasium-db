title: "containerd affected by a local privilege escalation via wide permissions on
  CRI directory"
description: "An overly broad default permission vulnerability was found in containerd.\n\n-
  `/var/lib/containerd` was created with the permission bits 0o711, while it should
  be created with 0o700\n- Allowed local users on the host to potentially access the
  metadata store and the content store\n- `/run/containerd/io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri`
  was created with 0o755, while it should be created with 0o700\n- Allowed local users
  on the host to potentially access the contents of Kubernetes local volumes. The
  contents of volumes might include setuid binaries, which could allow a local user
  on the host to elevate privileges on the host.\n- `/run/containerd/io.containerd.sandbox.controller.v1.shim`
  was created with 0o711, while it should be created with 0o700\n\nThe directory paths
  may differ depending on the daemon configuration.\nWhen the `temp` directory path
  is specified in the daemon configuration, that directory was also created with 0o711,
  while it should be created with 0o700."
