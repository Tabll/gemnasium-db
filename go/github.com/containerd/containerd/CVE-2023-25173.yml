title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command
  Injection')"
description: "containerd is an open source container runtime. A bug was found in containerd
  prior to versions 1.6.18 and 1.5.18 where supplementary groups are not set up properly
  inside a container. If an attacker has direct access to a container and manipulates
  their supplementary group access, they may be able to use supplementary group access
  to bypass primary group restrictions in some cases, potentially gaining access to
  sensitive information or gaining the ability to execute code in that container.
  Downstream applications that use the containerd client library may be affected as
  well. This bug has been fixed in containerd v1.6.18 and v.1.5.18. Users should update
  to these versions and recreate containers to resolve this issue. Users who rely
  on a downstream application that uses containerd's client library should check that
  application for a separate advisory and instructions. As a workaround, ensure that
  the `\"USER $USERNAME\"` Dockerfile instruction is not used. Instead, set the container
  entrypoint to a value similar to `ENTRYPOINT [\"su\", \"-\", \"user\"]` to allow
  `su` to properly set up supplementary groups."
