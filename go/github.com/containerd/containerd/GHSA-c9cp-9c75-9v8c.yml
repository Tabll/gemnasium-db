title: "containerd started with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities"
description: "A bug was found in containerd where containers were incorrectly started
  with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux
  environment and enabling programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate
  those capabilities to the permitted set during `execve(2)`.  Normally, when executable
  programs have specified permitted file capabilities, otherwise unprivileged users
  and processes can execute those programs and gain the specified file capabilities
  up to the bounding set.  Due to this bug, containers which included executable programs
  with inheritable file capabilities allowed otherwise unprivileged users and processes
  to additionally gain these inheritable file capabilities up to the container's bounding
  set.  Containers which use Linux users and groups to perform privilege separation
  inside the container are most directly impacted.\n\nThis bug did not affect the
  container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities
  than were included in the container's bounding set."
