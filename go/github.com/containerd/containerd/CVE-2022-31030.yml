package_slug: "go/github.com/containerd/containerd"
title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "containerd is an open source container runtime. A bug was found in the
  containerd's CRI implementation where programs inside a container can cause the
  containerd daemon to consume memory without bound during invocation of the `ExecSync`
  API. This can cause containerd to consume all available memory on the computer,
  denying service to other legitimate workloads. Kubernetes and crictl can both be
  configured to use containerd's CRI implementation; `ExecSync` may be used when running
  probes or when executing processes via an \"exec\" facility. This bug has been fixed
  in containerd 1.6.6 and 1.5.13. Users should update to these versions to resolve
  the issue. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that only trusted images and commands
  are used."
