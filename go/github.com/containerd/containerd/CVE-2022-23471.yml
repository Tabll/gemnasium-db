title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "containerd is an open source container runtime. A bug was found in containerd's
  CRI implementation where a user can exhaust memory on the host. In the CRI stream
  server, a goroutine is launched to handle terminal resize events if a TTY is requested.
  If the user's process fails to launch due to, for example, a faulty command, the
  goroutine will be stuck waiting to send without a receiver, resulting in a memory
  leak. Kubernetes and crictl can both be configured to use containerd's CRI implementation
  and the stream server is used for handling container IO. This bug has been fixed
  in containerd 1.6.12 and 1.5.16. Users should update to these versions to resolve
  the issue. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that only trusted images and commands
  are used and that only trusted users have permissions to execute commands in running
  containers."
