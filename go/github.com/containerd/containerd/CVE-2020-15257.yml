identifier: "CVE-2020-15257"
package_slug: "go/github.com/containerd/containerd"
title: "Incorrect Resource Transfer Between Spheres"
description: "The containerd-shim API is improperly exposed to host network containers.
  Access controls for the shimâ€™s API socket verified that the connecting process had
  an effective `UID` of `0`, but did not otherwise restrict access to the abstract
  Unix domain socket. This would allow malicious containers running in the same network
  namespace as the shim, with an effective `UID` of `0` but otherwise reduced privileges,
  to cause new processes to be run with elevated privileges."
