package_slug: "go/github.com/containerd/containerd"
title: "Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere"
description: "containerd is a container runtime. A bug was found in containerd where
  pulling and extracting a specially-crafted container image can result in Unix file
  permission changes for existing files in the host’s filesystem. Changes to file
  permissions can deny access to the expected owner of the file, widen access to others,
  or set extended bits like setuid, setgid, and sticky. This bug does not directly
  allow files to be read, modified, or executed without an additional cooperating
  process. As a workaround, ensure that users only pull images from trusted sources.
  Linux security modules (LSMs) like SELinux and AppArmor can limit the files potentially
  affected by this bug through policies and profiles that prevent containerd from
  interacting with specific files."
