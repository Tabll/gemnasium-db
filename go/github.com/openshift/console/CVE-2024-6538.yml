title: "OpenShift Console Server Side Request Forgery vulnerability"
description: "A flaw was found in OpenShift Console. A Server Side Request Forgery
  (SSRF) attack can happen if an attacker supplies all or part of a URL to the server
  to query. The server is considered to be in a privileged network position and can
  often reach exposed services that aren't readily available to clients due to network
  filtering. Leveraging such an attack vector, the attacker can have an impact on
  other services and potentially disclose information or have other nefarious effects
  on the system.\nThe /api/dev-console/proxy/internet endpoint on the OpenShit Console
  allows authenticated users to have the console's pod perform arbitrary and fully
  controlled HTTP(s) requests. The full response to these requests is returned by
  the endpoint.\nWhile the name of this endpoint suggests the requests are only bound
  to the internet, no such checks are in place. An authenticated user can therefore
  ask the console to perform arbitrary HTTP requests from outside the cluster to a
  service inside the cluster."
