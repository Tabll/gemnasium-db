title: "OpenShift Console Has a Path Traversal Vulnerability"
description: "A flaw was found in the OpenShift Console, an endpoint for plugins to
  serve resources in multiple languages: /locales/resources.json. This endpoint's
  lng and ns parameters are used to construct a filepath in pkg/plugins/handlers unsafely.go#L112
  Because of this unsafe filepath construction, an authenticated user can manipulate
  the path to retrieve any JSON files on the console's pod by using sequences of ../
  and valid directory paths."
