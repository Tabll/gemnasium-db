title: "OpenShift Must Gather Operator Improper Input Validation vulnerability"
description: "A flaw was found in the MustGather.managed.openshift.io Custom Defined
  Resource (CRD) of OpenShift Dedicated. A non-privileged user on the cluster can

  service account to run the job. This can allow a standard developer user to escalate
  their privileges to a cluster administrator and pivot to the AWS environment."
