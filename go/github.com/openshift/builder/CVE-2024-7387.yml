title: "OpenShift Builder has a path traversal, allows command injection in privileged
  BuildContainer"
description: "A flaw was found in openshift/builder. This vulnerability allows command
  injection via path traversal, where a malicious user can execute arbitrary commands
  on the OpenShift node running the builder container. When using the \"Docker\" strategy,
  executable files inside the privileged build container can be overridden using the
  `spec.source.secrets.secret.destinationDir` attribute of the `BuildConfig` definition.
  An attacker running code in a privileged container could escalate their permissions
  on the node running the container."
