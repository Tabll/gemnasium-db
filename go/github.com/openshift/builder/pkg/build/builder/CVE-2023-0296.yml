description: "The Birthday attack against 64-bit block ciphers flaw (CVE-2016-2183)
  was reported for the health checks port (9979) on etcd grpc-proxy component. Even
  though the CVE-2016-2183 has been fixed in the etcd components, to enable periodic
  health checks from kubelet, it was necessary to open up a new port (9979) on etcd
  grpc-proxy, hence this port might be considered as still vulnerable to the same
  type of vulnerability. The health checks on etcd grpc-proxy do not contain sensitive
  data (only metrics data), therefore the potential impact related to this vulnerability
  is minimal. The CVE-2023-0296 has been assigned to this issue to track the permanent
  fix in the etcd component."
