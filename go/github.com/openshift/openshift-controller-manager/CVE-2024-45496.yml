title: "OpenShift Controller Manager Improper Privilege Management"
description: "A flaw was found in OpenShift. This issue occurs due to the misuse of
  elevated privileges in the OpenShift Container Platform's build process. During
  the build initialization step, the git-clone container is run with a privileged
  security context, allowing unrestricted access to the node. An attacker with developer-level
  access can provide a crafted .gitconfig file containing commands executed during
  the cloning process, leading to arbitrary command execution on the worker node.
  An attacker running code in a privileged container could escalate their permissions
  on the node running the container."
