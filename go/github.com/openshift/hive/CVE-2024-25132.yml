package_slug: "go/github.com/openshift/hive"
title: "OpenShift Hive Has an Uncontrolled Resource Consumption Vulnerability"
description: "A flaw was found in the Hive hibernation controller component of OpenShift
  Dedicated. The ClusterDeployment.hive.openshift.io/v1 resource can be created with
  the spec.installed field set to true, regardless of the installation status, and
  a positive timespan for the spec.hibernateAfter value. If a ClusterSync.hiveinternal.openshift.io/v1alpha1
  resource is also created, the hive hibernation controller will enter the reconciliation
  loop leading to a panic when accessing a non-existing field in the ClusterDeploymentâ€™s
  status section, resulting in a denial of service."
