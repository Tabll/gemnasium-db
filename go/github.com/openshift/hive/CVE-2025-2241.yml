title: "Openshift Hive Exposes VCenter Credentials via ClusterProvision"
description: "A flaw was found in Hive, a component of Multicluster Engine (MCE) and
  Advanced Cluster Management (ACM). This vulnerability causes VCenter credentials
  to be exposed in the ClusterProvision object after provisioning a VSphere cluster.

  to unauthorized VCenter access, cluster management, and privilege escalation."
