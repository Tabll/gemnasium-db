title: "kube-apiserver authentication bypass vulnerability"
description: "An authentication bypass vulnerability was discovered in kube-apiserver.
  This issue could allow a remote, authenticated attacker who has been given permissions
  \"update, patch\" the \"pods/ephemeralcontainers\" subresource beyond what the default
  is. They would then need to create a new pod or patch one that they already have
  access to. This might allow evasion of SCC admission restrictions, thereby gaining
  control of a privileged pod."
