title: "Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness"
description: "A vulnerability was found in all versions of Keycloak Gatekeeper, where
  on using lower case HTTP headers (via cURL) an attacker can bypass our Gatekeeper.
  Lower case headers are also accepted by some webservers (e.g. Jetty). This means
  there is no protection when we put a Gatekeeper in front of a Jetty server and use
  lowercase headers."
