package_slug: "go/github.com/minio/minio"
title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "Minio is a Multi-Cloud Object Storage framework. Affected versions do
  not correctly honor a `Deny` policy on ByPassGoverance. Ideally, minio should return
  \"Access Denied\" to all users attempting to DELETE a versionId with the special
  header `X-Amz-Bypass-Governance-Retention: true`. However, this was not honored
  instead the request will be honored and an object under governance would be incorrectly
  deleted. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
  issue."
