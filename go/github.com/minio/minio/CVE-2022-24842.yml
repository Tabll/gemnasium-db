package_slug: "go/github.com/minio/minio"
title: "Improper Privilege Management"
description: "MinIO is a High Performance Object Storage released under GNU Affero
  General Public License v3.0. A security issue was found where an non-admin user
  is able to create service accounts for root or other admin users and then is able
  to assume their access policies via the generated credentials. This in turn allows
  the user to escalate privilege to that of the root user. This vulnerability has
  been resolved in `RELEASE.2022-04-12T06-55-35Z`. Users unable to upgrade may workaround
  this issue by explicitly adding a `admin:CreateServiceAccount` deny policy, however,
  this, in turn, denies the user the ability to create their own service accounts
  as well."
