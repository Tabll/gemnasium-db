package_slug: "go/github.com/minio/minio"
title: "Improper Access Control"
description: "Minio is a Multi-Cloud Object Storage framework. Starting with RELEASE.2020-12-23T02-24-12Z
  and prior to RELEASE.2023-03-13T19-46-17Z, a user with `consoleAdmin` permissions
  can potentially create a user that matches the root credential `accessKey`. Once
  this user is created successfully, the root credential ceases to work appropriately.
  The issue is patched in RELEASE.2023-03-13T19-46-17Z. There are ways to work around
  this via adding higher privileges to the disabled root user via `mc admin policy
  set`."
