description: "Minio is a Kubernetes native application for cloud storage. All users
  are affected by a vulnerability that involves bypassing policy restrictions on regular
  users. Normally, `checkKeyValid()` should return owner true for `rootCreds`. In
  the affected version, policy restriction does not work properly for users who does
  not have service (svc) or security token service (STS) accounts."
