package_slug: "go/github.com/minio/minio"
title: "Privilege Escalation on Windows via Path separator manipulation"
description: "Minio is a Multi-Cloud Object Storage framework. All users on Windows
  prior to version RELEASE.2023-03-20T20-16-18Z are impacted. MinIO fails to filter
  the `\\` character, which allows for arbitrary object placement across buckets.
  As a result, a user with low privileges, such as an access key, service account,
  or STS credential, which only has permission to `PutObject` in a specific bucket,
  can create an admin user. This issue is patched in RELEASE.2023-03-20T20-16-18Z.
  There are no known workarounds."
