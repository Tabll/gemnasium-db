title: "MinIO performs incomplete signature validation for unsigned-trailer uploads"
description: "This is a high priority vulnerability and users must upgrade ASAP.\n\nThe
  signature component of the authorization may be invalid, which would mean that as
  a client you can use any arbitrary secret to upload objects given the user already
  has prior WRITE permissions on the bucket,\n\nPrior knowledge of access-key, and
  bucket name this user might have access to - and an access-key with a WRITE permissions
  is necessary.\n\nHowever with relevant information in place, uploading random objects
  to buckets is trivial and easy via `curl`"
