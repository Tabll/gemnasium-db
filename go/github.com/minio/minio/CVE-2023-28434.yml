title: "Privilege Escalation on Linux/MacOS"
description: "Minio is a Multi-Cloud Object Storage framework. Prior to RELEASE.2023-03-20T20-16-18Z,
  an attacker can use crafted requests to bypass metadata bucket name checking and
  put an object into any bucket while processing `PostPolicyBucket`. To carry out
  this attack, the attacker requires credentials with `arn:aws:s3:::*` permission,
  as well as enabled Console API access. This issue has been patched in RELEASE.2023-03-20T20-16-18Z.
  As a workaround, enable browser API access and turn off `MINIO_BROWSER=off`."
