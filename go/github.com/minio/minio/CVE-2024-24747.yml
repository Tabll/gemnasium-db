package_slug: "go/github.com/minio/minio"
title: "Improper Privilege Management"
description: "MinIO is a High Performance Object Storage. When someone creates an
  access key, it inherits the permissions of the parent key. Not only for `s3:*` actions,
  but also `admin:*` actions. Which means unless somewhere above in the access-key
  hierarchy, the `admin` rights are denied, access keys will be able to simply override
  their own `s3` permissions to something more permissive. The vulnerability is fixed
  in RELEASE.2024-01-31T20-20-33Z."
