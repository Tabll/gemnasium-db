title: "go-grpc-compression has a zstd decompression bombing vulnerability"
description: "A malicious user could cause a denial of service (DoS) when using a
  specially crafted gRPC request. The decompression mechanism for zstd did not respect
  the limits imposed by gRPC, allowing rapid memory usage increases.\n\nVersions v1.1.4
  through to v1.2.2 made use of the Decoder.DecodeAll function in github.com/klauspost/compress/zstd
  to decompress data provided by the peer. The vulnerability is exploitable only by
  attackers who can send gRPC payloads to users of github.com/mostynb/go-grpc-compression/zstd
  or github.com/mostynb/go-grpc-compression/nonclobbering/zstd."
