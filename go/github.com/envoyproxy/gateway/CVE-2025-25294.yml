title: "Envoy Gateway Log Injection Vulnerability"
description: "In all Envoy Gateway versions prior to 1.2.7 and 1.3.1 a default Envoy
  Proxy access log configuration is used. This format is vulnerable to log injection
  attacks.\n\nIf the attacker uses a specially crafted user-agent which performs json
  injection, then he could add and overwrite fields to the access log.\n\nExamples
  of attacks include:\n\n-  Using following string as user agent : `HELLO-WORLD\",
  \"evil-ip\": \"1.1.1.1\", \"x-forwarded-for\": \"1.1.1.1` would lead to setting
  of new access log properties and overwrite of existing properties. Existing properties
  such as the value of the X-Forwarded-For header may have importance for security
  analysis of access logs, and their overwrite can be used to hide malicious activity.\n\n-
  Using the following string as user-agent : `\"` which renders an invalid json document.
  The invalid document may fail to be processed by observability solutions, which
  would allow attacker to hide malicious activity."
