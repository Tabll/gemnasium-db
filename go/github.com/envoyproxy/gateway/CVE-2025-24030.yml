title: "Envoy Admin Interface Exposed through prometheus metrics endpoint"
description: "A user with access to a Kubernetes cluster where Envoy Gateway is installed
  can use a path traversal attack to execute Envoy Admin interface commands on proxies
  managed by Envoy Gateway. The admin interface can be used to terminate the Envoy
  process and extract the Envoy configuration (possibly containing confidential data).\n\nFor
  example, the following command, if run from within the Kubernetes cluster, can be
  used to get the configuration dump of the proxy:\n```\ncurl --path-as-is http://<Proxy-Service-ClusterIP>:19001/stats/prometheus/../../config_dump\n```"
