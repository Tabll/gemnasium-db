package_slug: "go/github.com/envoyproxy/envoy"
title: "Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference"
description: "Envoy 1.9.0 and before does not normalize HTTP URL paths. A remote attacker
  may craft a relative path, e.g., something/../admin, to bypass access control, e.g.,
  a block on /admin. A backend server could then interpret the non-normalized path
  and provide an attacker access beyond the scope provided for by the access control
  policy."
