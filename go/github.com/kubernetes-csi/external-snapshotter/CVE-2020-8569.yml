identifier: "CVE-2020-8569"
package_slug: "go/github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-snapshotter"
title: "NULL Pointer Dereference"
description: "Kubernetes CSI snapshot-controller prior to v2.1.3 and v3.0.2 could
  panic when processing a `VolumeSnapshot` custom resource when either the
  `VolumeSnapshot` referenced a non-existing `PersistentVolumeClaim` and the
  `VolumeSnapshot` did not reference any `VolumeSnapshotClass` or when the
  snapshot-controller crashes, is automatically restarted by Kubernetes, and
  processes the same `VolumeSnapshot` custom resource after the restart,
  entering an endless crashloop. Only the volume snapshot feature is affected by
  this vulnerability. When exploited, users canâ€™t take snapshots of their volumes
  or delete the snapshots. All other Kubernetes functionality is not affected."
