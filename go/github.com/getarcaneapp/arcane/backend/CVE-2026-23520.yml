title: "Arcane Has a Command Injection in Arcane Updater Lifecycle Labels That Enables
  RCE"
description: "Arcane’s updater service supported lifecycle labels `com.getarcaneapp.arcane.lifecycle.pre-update`
  and `com.getarcaneapp.arcane.lifecycle.post-update` that allowed defining a command
  to run before or after a container update. The label value is passed directly to
  /bin/sh -c without sanitization or validation.\n\nBecause any authenticated user
  (not limited to administrators) can create projects through the API, an attacker
  can create a project that specifies one of these lifecycle labels with a malicious
  command. When an administrator later triggers a container update (either manually
  or via scheduled update checks), Arcane reads the lifecycle label and executes its
  value as a shell command inside the container.\n\nIf the container is configured
  with host volume mounts in its Compose definition, the executed command may be able
  to read from or write to the host filesystem through the mounted paths. This can
  enable data theft and, in some configurations, escalation to full host compromise
  (for example, if /var/run/docker.sock is mounted)."
