title: "Ineffective privileges drop when requesting container network"
description: "Apptainer is an open source container platform. Version 1.2.0-rc.2 introduced
  an ineffective privilege drop when requesting container network setup, therefore
  subsequent functions are called with root privileges, the attack surface is rather
  limited for users but an attacker could possibly craft a starter config to delete
  any directory on the host filesystems. A security fix has been included in Apptainer
  1.2.1. There is no known workaround outside of upgrading to Apptainer 1.2.1."
