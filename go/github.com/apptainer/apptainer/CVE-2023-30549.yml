title: "Use After Free"
description: "Apptainer is an open source container platform for Linux. There is an
  ext4 use-after-free flaw that is exploitable through versions of Apptainer < 1.1.0,
  installations that include apptainer-suid < 1.1.8, and all versions of Singularity
  in their default configurations on older operating systems where that CVE has not
  been patched. That includes Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, Debian 10 buster (unless
  the linux-5.10 package is installed), Ubuntu 18.04 bionic and Ubuntu 20.04 focal.
  Use-after-free flaws in the kernel can be used to attack the kernel for denial of
  service and potentially for privilege escalation.\n\nApptainer 1.1.8 includes a
  patch that by default disables mounting of extfs filesystem types in setuid-root
  mode, while continuing to allow mounting of extfs filesystems in non-setuid \"rootless\"
  mode using fuse2fs.\n\nSome workarounds are possible. Either do not install apptainer-suid
  (for versions 1.1.0 through 1.1.7) or set `allow setuid = no` in apptainer.conf
  (or singularity.conf for singularity versions). This requires having unprivileged
  user namespaces enabled and except for apptainer 1.1.x versions will disallow mounting
  of sif files, extfs files, and squashfs files in addition to other, less significant
  impacts. (Encrypted sif files are also not supported unprivileged in apptainer 1.1.x.).
  Alternatively, use the `limit containers` options in apptainer.conf/singularity.conf
  to limit sif files to trusted users, groups, and/or paths, and set `allow container
  extfs = no` to disallow mounting of extfs overlay files. The latter option by itself
  does not disallow mounting of extfs overlay partitions inside SIF files, so that's
  why the former options are also needed."
