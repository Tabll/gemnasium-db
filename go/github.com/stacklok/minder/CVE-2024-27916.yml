title: "`GetRepositoryByName`, `DeleteRepositoryByName` and `GetArtifactByName` allow
  access of arbitrary repositories in Minder by any authenticated user"
description: "### Summary\nA Minder user can use the endpoints listed in the issue
  title to access any repository in the DB, irrespective of who owns the repo and
  any permissions that user may have.\n\n### Details\n\n
  The DB query used here checks by repo owner, repo name and provider name (which is always
  \"github\"). These query values are not distinct for the particular user - as long
  as the user has valid credentials and a provider, they can set the repo owner/name
  to any value they want and the server will return information on this repo.\n\n`DeleteRepositoryByName`
  uses the same query and I have been able to delete another user's repo using this
  technique.\n\nThe `GetArtifactByName` endpoint also uses this DB query. I have not
  reproduced the behaviour with this endpoint due to a lack of a suitable test case,
  but I do not see anything in the implementation of the endpoint to prevent it being
  exploited."
