title: "Minder's GitHub Webhook Handler vulnerable to DoS from un-validated requests"
description: "Minder's `HandleGithubWebhook` is susceptible to a denial of service
  attack from an untrusted HTTP request. The vulnerability exists before the request
  has been validated, and as such the request is still untrusted at the point of failure.
  This allows an attacker with the ability to send requests to `HandleGithubWebhook`
  to crash the Minder controlplane and deny other users from using it.\n\nOne of the
  first things that `HandleGithubWebhook` does is to validate the payload signature.
  This is done by way of the internal helper `validatePayloadSignature`:"
