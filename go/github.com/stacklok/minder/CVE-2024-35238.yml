title: "Denial of service of Minder Server from maliciously crafted GitHub attestations"
description: "Minder is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack which could
  allow an attacker to crash the Minder server and deny other users access to it.\n\nThe
  root cause of the vulnerability is that Minders sigstore verifier reads an untrusted
  response entirely into memory without enforcing a limit on the response body. An
  attacker can exploit this by making Minder make a request to an attacker-controlled
  endpoint which returns a response with a large body which will crash the Minder
  server.\n\nSpecifically, the point of failure is where Minder parses the response
  from the GitHub attestations endpoint in `getAttestationReply`. Here, Minder makes
  a request to the `orgs/$owner/attestations/$checksumref` GitHub endpoint (line 285)
  and then parses the response into the `AttestationReply` (line 295):"
