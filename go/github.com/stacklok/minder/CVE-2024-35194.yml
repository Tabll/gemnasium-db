description: "Minder engine is susceptible to a denial of service from memory exhaustion
  that can be triggered from maliciously created templates.\n\nMinder engine uses

  pull requests, descriptions for advisories. In some cases can the user control both
  the template and the params for it, and in a subset of these cases, Minder reads

  Minder will exhaust memory and crash.\n\nOne of these places is the REST ingester:"
