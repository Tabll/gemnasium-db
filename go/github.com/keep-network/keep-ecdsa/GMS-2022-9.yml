title: "Incorrect validation of parties IDs leaks secret keys in Secret-sharing scheme"
description: "In the threshold signature scheme, participants start by
  dividing secrets into shares using a secret sharing scheme. The Verifiable Secret
  Sharing scheme generates shares from the userâ€™s IDs but does not properly validate
  them. Using a malicious ID will make other users reveal their secrets during the
  secret-sharing procedure. In addition, a second issue resulting from lack of validation
  could cause nodes to crash when sent maliciously formed user IDs."
