title: "Navidrome affected by Denial of Service and disk exhaustion via oversized
  `size` parameter in `/rest/getCoverArt` and `/share/img/<token>` endpoints"
description: "Authenticated users can crash the Navidrome server by supplying an excessively
  large `size` parameter to `/rest/getCoverArt` or to a shared-image URL (`/share/img/<token>`).
  When processing such requests, the server attempts to create an extremely large
  resized image, causing uncontrolled memory growth. This triggers the Linux OOM killer,
  terminates the Navidrome process, and results in a full service outage.\n\nIf the
  system has sufficient memory and survives the allocation, Navidrome then writes
  these extremely large resized images into its cache directory, allowing an attacker
  to rapidly exhaust server disk space as well."
