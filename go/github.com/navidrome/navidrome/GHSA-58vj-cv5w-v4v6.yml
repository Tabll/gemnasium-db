title: "Navidrome has Multiple SQL Injections and ORM Leak"
description: "Navidrome automatically adds parameters in the URL to SQL queries. This
  can be exploited to access information by adding parameters like `password=...`
  in the URL (ORM Leak).\n\nFurthermore, the names of the parameters are not properly
  escaped, leading to SQL Injections.\n\nFinally, the username is used in a `LIKE`
  statement, allowing people to log in with `%` instead of their username."
