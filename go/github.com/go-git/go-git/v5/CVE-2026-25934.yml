package_slug: "go/github.com/go-git/go-git/v5"
title: "go-git improperly verifies data integrity values for .idx and .pack files"
description: "A vulnerability was discovered in `go-git` whereby data integrity values
  for `.pack` and `.idx` files were not properly verified. This resulted in `go-git`
  potentially consuming corrupted files, which would likely result in unexpected errors
  such as `object not found`.\n\nFor context, clients fetch [`packfiles`](https://git-scm.com/docs/pack-protocol#_packfile_data)
  from upstream Git servers. Those files contain a checksum of their contents, so
  that clients can perform integrity checks before consuming it. The pack indexes
  (`.idx`) are [generated](https://git-scm.com/docs/pack-format) locally by `go-git`,
  or the `git` cli, when new `.pack` files are received and processed. The integrity
  checks for both files were not being verified correctly.\n\nNote that the lack of
  verification of the packfile checksum has no impact on the trust relationship between
  the client and server, which is enforced based on the protocol being used (e.g.
  TLS in the case of `https://` or known hosts for `ssh://`). In other words, the
  packfile checksum verification does not provide any security benefits when connecting
  to a malicious or compromised Git server."
