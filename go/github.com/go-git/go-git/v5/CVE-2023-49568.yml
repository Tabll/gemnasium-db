title: "Maliciously crafted Git server replies can cause DoS on go-git clients"
description: "A denial of service (DoS) vulnerability was discovered in go-git versions
  prior to `v5.11`. This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform denial of service
  attacks by providing specially crafted responses from a Git server which triggers
  resource exhaustion in `go-git` clients.\n\nApplications using only the in-memory
  filesystem supported by `go-git` are not affected by this vulnerability.\nThis is
  a `go-git` implementation issue and does not affect the upstream `git` cli."
