package_slug: "go/github.com/contribsys/faktory"
title: "Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value"
description: "Faktory is a language-agnostic persistent background job server. Prior
  to version 1.8.0, the Faktory web dashboard can suffer from denial of service by
  a crafted malicious url query param `days`. The vulnerability is related to how
  the backend reads the `days` URL query parameter in the Faktory web dashboard. The
  value is used directly without any checks to create a string slice. If a very large
  value is provided, the backend server ends up using a significant amount of memory
  and causing it to crash. Version 1.8.0 fixes this issue."
