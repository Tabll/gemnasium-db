title: "quic-go Has Panic in Path Probe Loss Recovery Handling"
description: "The loss recovery logic for path probe packets that was added in the
  v0.50.0 release can be used to trigger a nil-pointer dereference by a malicious
  QUIC client.\n\nIn order to do so, the attacker first sends valid QUIC packets from
  different remote addresses (thereby triggering the newly added path validation logic:
  the server sends path probe packets), and then sending ACKs for packets received
  from the server specifically crafted to trigger the nil-pointer dereference."
