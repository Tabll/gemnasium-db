title: "quic-go vulnerable to pointer dereference that can lead to panic"
description: "quic-go is an implementation of the [QUIC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000)
  transport protocol in Go. By serializing an ACK frame after the CRYTPO that allows
  a node to complete the handshake, a remote node could trigger a nil pointer dereference
  (leading to a panic) when the node attempted to drop the Handshake packet number
  space.\n\n**Impact**\n\nAn attacker can bring down a quic-go node with very minimal
  effort. Completing the QUIC handshake only requires sending and receiving a few
  packets.\n\n**Patches**\n\n[v0.37.3](https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/releases/tag/v0.37.3)
  contains a patch. Versions before v0.37.0 are not affected."
