title: "quic-go HTTP/3 QPACK Header Expansion DoS"
description: "An attacker can cause excessive memory allocation in quic-go's HTTP/3
  client and server implementations by sending a QPACK-encoded HEADERS frame that
  decodes into a large header field section (many unique header names and/or large
  values). The implementation builds an `http.Header` (used on the `http.Request`
  and `http.Response`, respectively), while only enforcing limits on the size of the
  (QPACK-compressed) HEADERS frame, but not on the decoded header, leading to memory
  exhaustion."
