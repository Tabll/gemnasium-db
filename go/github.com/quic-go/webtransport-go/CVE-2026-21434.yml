title: "webtransport-go: Memory Exhaustion Attack due to Missing Length Check in WT_CLOSE_SESSION
  Capsule"
description: "An attacker can cause excessive memory consumption in webtransport-go's
  session implementation by sending a WT_CLOSE_SESSION capsule containing an excessively
  large Application Error Message. The implementation does not enforce the draft-mandated
  limit of 1024 bytes on this field, allowing a peer to send an arbitrarily large
  message payload that is fully read and stored in memory.\n\nThis allows an attacker
  to consume an arbitrary amount of memory. The attacker must transmit the full payload
  to achieve the memory consumption, but the lack of any upper bound makes large-scale
  attacks feasible given sufficient bandwidth."
