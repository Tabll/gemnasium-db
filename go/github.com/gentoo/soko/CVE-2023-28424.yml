title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')"
description: "Soko if the code that powers packages.gentoo.org. Prior to version 1.0.2,
  the two package search handlers, `Search` and `SearchFeed`, implemented in `pkg/app/handler/packages/search.go`,
  are affected by a SQL injection via the `q` parameter. As a result, unauthenticated
  attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries on `https://packages.gentoo.org/`. It
  was also demonstrated that primitive was enough to gain code execution in the context
  of the PostgreSQL container. The issue was addressed in commit `4fa6e4b619c0362728955b6ec56eab0e0cbf1e23y`
  of version 1.0.2 using prepared statements to interpolate user-controlled data in
  SQL queries."
