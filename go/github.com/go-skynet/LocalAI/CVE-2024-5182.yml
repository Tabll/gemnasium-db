title: "LocalAI path traversal vulnerability"
description: "A path traversal vulnerability exists in mudler/localai version 2.14.0,
  where an attacker can exploit the `model` parameter during the model deletion process
  to delete arbitrary files. Specifically, by crafting a request with a manipulated
  `model` parameter, an attacker can traverse the directory structure and target files
  outside of the intended directory, leading to the deletion of sensitive data. This
  vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation and sanitization of the `model`
  parameter."
