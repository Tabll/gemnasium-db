title: "Use After Free"
description: "Wasmtime is an open source runtime for WebAssembly & WASI. In Wasmtime
  from version 0.19.0 and before version 0.30.0 there was a use-after-free bug when
  passing `externref`s from the host to guest Wasm content. To trigger the bug, you
  have to explicitly pass multiple `externref`s from the host to a Wasm instance at
  the same time, either by passing multiple `externref`s as arguments from host code
  to a Wasm function, or returning multiple `externref`s to Wasm from a multi-value
  return function defined in the host. If you do not have host code that matches one
  of these shapes, then you are not impacted. If Wasmtime's `VMExternRefActivationsTable`
  became filled to capacity after passing the first `externref` in, then passing in
  the second `externref` could trigger a garbage collection. However the first `externref`
  is not rooted until we pass control to Wasm, and therefore could be reclaimed by
  the collector if nothing else was holding a reference to it or otherwise keeping
  it alive. Then, when control was passed to Wasm after the garbage collection, Wasm
  could use the first `externref`, which at this point has already been freed. We
  have reason to believe that the effective impact of this bug is relatively small
  because usage of `externref` is currently quite rare. The bug has been fixed, and
  users should upgrade to Wasmtime 0.30.0. If you cannot upgrade Wasmtime yet, you
  can avoid the bug by disabling reference types support in Wasmtime by passing `false`
  to `wasmtime::Config::wasm_reference_types`."
