title: "Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer"
description: "Wasmtime is a standalone runtime for WebAssembly. Prior to version 2.0.2,
  there is a bug in Wasmtime's implementation of its pooling instance allocator where
  when a linear memory is reused for another instance the initial heap snapshot of
  the prior instance can be visible, erroneously to the next instance. This bug has
  been patched and users should upgrade to Wasmtime 2.0.2. Other mitigations include
  disabling the pooling allocator and disabling the `memory-init-cow`."
