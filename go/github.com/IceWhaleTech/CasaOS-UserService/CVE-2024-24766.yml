title: "CasaOS Username Enumeration"
description: "### Summary\n\nThe Casa OS Login page has disclosed the username enumeration
  vulnerability in the login page.\n\n### Details\n\nIt is observed that the attacker
  can enumerate the CasaOS username using the application response. If the username
  is incorrect application gives the error \"**User does not exist**\",  If the password
  is incorrect application gives the error \"**Invalid password**\". \n\n### PoC\n\nCapture
  the login request in a tool like Burp Suit and use the intruder tab for trying multiple
  usernames. \nKeep checking the response of each request if the response says **Invalid
  password** then the username is right.\n\n### Impact\n\nUsing this error attacker
  can enumerate the username of CasaOS. \n\n### The logic behind the issue\n\nIf the
  username is incorrect, then throw an error \"User does not exist\" else throw an
  error \"Invalid password\".\n\nThis condition can be vice versa like:\n\nIf the
  password is incorrect, then throw an error \"Invalid password\" else throw an error
  \"User does not exist\".\n\n### Mitigation\n\nSince this is the condition we have
  to implement a single error which can be \"Username/Password is Incorrect!!!\"\n\n\n\n"
