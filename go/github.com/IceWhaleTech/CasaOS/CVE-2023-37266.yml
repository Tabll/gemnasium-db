package_slug: "go/github.com/IceWhaleTech/CasaOS"
title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "CasaOS is an open-source Personal Cloud system. Unauthenticated attackers
  can craft arbitrary JWTs and access features that usually require authentication
  and execute arbitrary commands as `root` on CasaOS instances. This problem was addressed
  by improving the validation of JWTs in commit `705bf1f`. This patch is part of CasaOS
  0.4.4. Users should upgrade to CasaOS 0.4.4. If they can't, they should temporarily
  restrict access to CasaOS to untrusted users, for instance by not exposing it publicly."
