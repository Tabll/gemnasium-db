package_slug: "go/github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "Woodpecker is a community fork of the Drone CI system. In affected versions
  an attacker can post malformed webhook data witch lead to an update of the repository
  data that can e.g. allow the takeover of an repo. This is only critical if the CI
  is configured for public usage and connected to a forge witch is also in public
  usage. This issue has been addressed in version 1.0.2. Users are advised to upgrade.
  Users unable to upgrade should secure the CI system by making it inaccessible to
  untrusted entities, for example, by placing it behind a firewall."
