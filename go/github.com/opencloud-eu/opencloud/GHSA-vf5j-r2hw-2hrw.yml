title: "OpenCloud Affected by Public Link Exploit"
description: "A security issue was discovered in [Reva](https://github.com/opencloud-eu/reva)
  that enables a malicious user to bypass the scope validation of a public link. That
  allows it to access resources outside the scope of a public link.\n\nOpenCloud uses
  Reva as one of its core components and thus it is affected."
