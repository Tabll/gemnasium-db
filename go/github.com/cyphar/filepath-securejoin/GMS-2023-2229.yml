title: "SecureJoin: on windows, paths outside of the rootfs could be inadvertently
  produced"
description: "### Impact\nFor Windows users of `github.com/cyphar/filepath-securejoin`,
  until v0.2.4 it was possible for certain rootfs and path combinations (in particular,
  where a malicious Unix-style `/`-separated unsafe path was used with a Windows-style
  rootfs path) to result in generated paths that were outside of the provided rootfs.\n\nIt
  is unclear to what extent this has a practical impact on real users, but given the
  possible severity of the issue we have released an emergency patch release that
  resolves this issue.\n\nThanks to @pjbgf for discovering, debugging, and fixing
  this issue (as well as writing some tests for it).\n\n### Patches\nc121231e1276e11049547bee5ce68d5a2cfe2d9b
  is the patch fixing this issue. v0.2.4 contains the fix.\n\n### Workarounds\nUsers
  could use `filepath.FromSlash()` on all unsafe paths before passing them to `filepath-securejoin`.\n\n###
  References\nSee #9."
