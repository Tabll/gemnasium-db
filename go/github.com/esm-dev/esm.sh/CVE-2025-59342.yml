title: "esm.sh has arbitrary file write via path traversal in `X-Zone-Id` header"
description: "A path-traversal flaw in the handling of the `X-Zone-Id` HTTP header
  allows an attacker to cause the application to write files outside the intended
  storage location. The header value is used to build a filesystem path but is not
  properly canonicalized or restricted to the application’s storage base directory.
  As a result, supplying `../` sequences in `X-Zone-Id` causes files to be written
  to arbitrary directories (example observed: `~/.esmd/modules/transform/<id>/` instead
  of `~/.esmd/storage/modules/transform`).\n\n**Severity:** Medium\n\n**Component
  / Endpoint:**\n\n`POST /transform` — handling of `X-Zone-Id` header\n\nThe vulnerable
  code is in https://github.com/esm-dev/esm.sh/blob/main/server/router.go#L116 and
  https://github.com/esm-dev/esm.sh/blob/main/server/router.go#L411\n\n**Impact:**
  Arbitrary file creation / overwrite outside intended storage directory (file write
  to attacker-controlled path). Possible remote code execution, persistence, tampering
  with application files, or facilitating further path-traversal attacks.\n\n---"
