title: "esm.sh CDN service has arbitrary file write via tarslip"
description: "The esm.sh CDN service is vulnerable to a Path Traversal (CWE-22) vulnerability
  during NPM package tarball extraction.\nAn attacker can craft a malicious NPM package
  containing specially crafted file paths (e.g., `package/../../tmp/evil.js`).\nWhen
  esm.sh downloads and extracts this package, files may be written to arbitrary locations
  on the server, escaping the intended extraction directory.\n\nUploading files containing
  `../` in the path is not allowed on official registries (npm, GitHub), but the `X-Npmrc`
  header allows specifying any arbitrary registry.\nBy setting the registry to an
  attacker-controlled server via the `X-Npmrc` header, this vulnerability can be triggered."
