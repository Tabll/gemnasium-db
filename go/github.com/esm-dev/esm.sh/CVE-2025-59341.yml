title: "esm.sh has File Inclusion issue"
description: "A Local File Inclusion (LFI) issue was identified in the esm.sh service
  URL handling. An attacker could craft a request that causes the server to read and
  return files from the host filesystem (or other unintended file sources).\n\n**Severity:**
  High — LFI can expose secrets, configuration files, credentials, or enable further
  compromise.\n**Impact:** reading configuration files, private keys, environment
  files, or other sensitive files; disclosure of secrets or credentials; information
  leakage that could enable further attacks."
