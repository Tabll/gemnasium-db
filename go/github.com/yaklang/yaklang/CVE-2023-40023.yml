title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "yaklang is a programming language designed for cybersecurity. The Yak
  Engine has been found to contain a local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability. This
  vulnerability allows attackers to include files from the server's local file system
  through the web application. When exploited, this can lead to the unintended exposure
  of sensitive data, potential remote code execution, or other security breaches.
  Users utilizing versions of the Yak Engine prior to 1.2.4-sp1 are impacted. This
  vulnerability has been patched in version 1.2.4-sp1. Users are advised to upgrade.
  users unable to upgrade may avoid exposing vulnerable versions to untrusted input
  and to closely monitor any unexpected server behavior until they can upgrade."
