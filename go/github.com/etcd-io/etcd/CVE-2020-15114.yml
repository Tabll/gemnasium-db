package_slug: "go/github.com/etcd-io/etcd"
title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "The etcd gateway is a simple TCP proxy to allow for basic service discovery
  and access. However, it is possible to include the gateway address as an endpoint.
  This results in a denial of service, since the endpoint can become stuck in a loop
  of requesting itself until there are no more available file descriptors to accept
  connections on the gateway."
