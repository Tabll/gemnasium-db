identifier: "CVE-2020-15136"
package_slug: "go/github.com/etcd-io/etcd"
title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "In etcd, gateway TLS authentication is only applied to endpoints detected
  in DNS SRV records. When starting a gateway, TLS authentication will only be attempted
  on endpoints identified in DNS SRV records for a given domain, which occurs in the
  discoverEndpoints function. No authentication is performed against endpoints provided
  in the `--endpoints` flag. This has been fixed with improved documentation and deprecation
  of the functionality."
