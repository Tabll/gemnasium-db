package_slug: "go/github.com/etcd-io/etcd"
title: "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
description: "A cross-site request forgery flaw was found in etcd. An attacker can
  set up a website that tries to send a POST request to the etcd server and modify
  a key. Adding a key is done with PUT so it is theoretically safe (can't PUT from
  an HTML form or such) but POST allows creating in-order keys that an attacker can
  send."
