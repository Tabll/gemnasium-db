package_slug: "go/github.com/etcd-io/etcd"
title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "etcd is a distributed key-value store for the data of a distributed
  system. Prior to versions 3.4.26 and 3.5.9, the LeaseTimeToLive API allows access
  to key names (not value) associated to a lease when `Keys` parameter is true, even
  a user does not have read permission to the keys. The impact is limited to a cluster
  which enables auth (RBAC). Versions 3.4.26 and 3.5.9 fix this issue. There are no
  known workarounds."
