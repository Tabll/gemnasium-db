title: "Ratify Azure authentication providers can leak authentication tokens to non-Azure
  container registries"
description: "In a Kubernetes environment, Ratify can be configured to authenticate
  to a private Azure Container Registry (ACR). The Azure workload identity and Azure
  managed identity authentication providers are configured in this setup. Users that
  configure a private ACR to be used with the Azure authentication providers may be
  impacted.\nBoth Azure authentication providers attempt to exchange an Entra ID (EID)
  token for an ACR refresh token. However, Ratifyâ€™s Azure authentication providers
  did not verify that the target registry is an ACR. This could have led to the EID
  token being presented to a non-ACR registry during token exchange. EID tokens with
  ACR access can potentially be extracted and abused if a user workload contains an
  image reference to a malicious registry."
