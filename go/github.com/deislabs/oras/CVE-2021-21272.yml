title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "ORAS is open source software which enables a way to push OCI Artifacts
  to OCI Conformant registries. ORAS suffers from a `zip-slip` vulnerability. The 
  directory support feature allows the downloaded gzipped tarballs to be automatically
  extracted to the user-specified directory where the tarball can have symbolic links 
  and hard links. A well-crafted tarball or tarballs allow malicious artifact providers 
  linking, writing, or overwriting specific files on the host filesystem outside of the 
  user-specified directory unexpectedly with the same permissions as the user who 
  runs `oras pull`."
