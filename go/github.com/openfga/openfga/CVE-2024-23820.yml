package_slug: "go/github.com/openfga/openfga"
title: "Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling"
description: "OpenFGA, an authorization/permission engine, is vulnerable to a denial
  of service attack in versions prior to 1.4.3. In some scenarios that depend on the
  model and tuples used, a call to `ListObjects` may not release memory properly.
  So when a sufficiently high number of those calls are executed, the OpenFGA server
  can create an `out of memory` error and terminate. Version 1.4.3 contains a patch
  for this issue."
