description: "### Overview\nOpenFGA v1.3.8 to v1.8.2 (Helm chart openfga-0.1.38 to
  openfga-0.2.19, docker v1.3.8 to v.1.8.2) are vulnerable to authorization bypass
  when certain Check and ListObject calls are executed.\n\n### Am I Affected?\nYou
  are affected by this authorization bypass vulnerability if you are using OpenFGA
  v1.3.8 to v1.8.2, specifically under the following conditions: \n1. Calling Check
  API or ListObjects with a model that uses [conditions](https://openfga.dev/docs/modeling/conditions),
  and \n2. OpenFGA is configured with caching enabled (`OPENFGA_CHECK_QUERY_CACHE_ENABLED`),
  and \n3. Check API call or ListObjects API calls contain [contextual tuples](https://openfga.dev/docs/concepts#what-are-contextual-tuples)
  that include conditions.\n\n### Fix\nUpgrade to v1.8.3. This upgrade is backwards
  compatible."
