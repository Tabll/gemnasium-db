description: "OpenFGA is a flexible authorization/permission engine built for developers
  and inspired by Google Zanzibar. Affected versions of OpenFGA is vulnerable to a

  some scenarios, those calls are not releasing resources even after a response has
  been sent, and given a sufficient call volume the service as a whole becomes unresponsive.
  This issue has been addressed in version 1.3.4 and the upgrade is considered backwards
  compatible. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
