title: "OpenFGA Authorization Bypass"
description: "### Overview\nOpenFGA v1.8.0 to v1.8.12 ( openfga-0.2.16 <= Helm chart
  <= openfga-0.2.31, v1.8.0 <= docker <= v.1.8.12) are vulnerable to authorization
  bypass when certain Check and ListObject calls are executed.\n\n\n### Am I Affected?\nIf
  you are using OpenFGA v1.8.0 to v1.8.12, specifically under the following conditions,
  you are affected by this authorization bypass vulnerability:\n- Calling Check API
  or ListObjects with an [authorization model](https://openfga.dev/docs/concepts#what-is-an-authorization-model)
  that has a relationship directly assignable by both [type bound public access](https://openfga.dev/docs/concepts#what-is-type-bound-public-access)
  and [userset](https://openfga.dev/docs/modeling/building-blocks/usersets), and\n-
  There are check or list object queries with [contextual tuples](https://openfga.dev/docs/interacting/contextual-tuples)
  for the relationship that can be directly assignable by both [type bound public
  access](https://openfga.dev/docs/concepts#what-is-type-bound-public-access) and
  [userset](https://openfga.dev/docs/modeling/building-blocks/usersets), and\n- Those
  contextual tuplesâ€™s user field is an userset, and\n- Type bound public access tuples
  are not assigned to the relationship\n\n### Fix\nUpgrade to v1.8.13. This upgrade
  is backwards compatible.\n\n### Acknowledgments\nOkta would like to thank @udyvish
  for discovering this vulnerability."
