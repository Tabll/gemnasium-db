title: "OpenFGA Authorization Bypass "
description: "### Overview\nOpenFGA v1.9.3 to v1.9.4 ( openfga-0.2.40 <= Helm chart
  <= openfga-0.2.41, v1.9.3 <= docker <= v.1.9.4) are vulnerable to improper policy
  enforcement when certain Check and ListObject calls are executed.\n\n### Am I Affected?\nYou
  are affected by this vulnerability if you are using OpenFGA v1.9.3 to v1.9.4, specifically
  under the following preconditions:\n- Calling Check API or ListObjects with an [authorization
  model](https://openfga.dev/docs/concepts#what-is-an-authorization-model) that has
  a relationship directly assignable by more than 1 [userset](https://openfga.dev/docs/modeling/building-blocks/usersets)
  with same [type](https://openfga.dev/docs/concepts#what-is-a-type), and\n- There
  are check or list object queries that rely on the above relationship, and\n- You
  have userset tuples that are assigned to the above relationship\n\n\n### Fix\nUpgrade
  to v1.9.5. This upgrade is backwards compatible.\n\n### Workaround\nDowngrade to
  v1.9.2 with enable-check-optimizations removed from OPENFGA_EXPERIMENTALS\n\n###
  Acknowledgments\nOpenFGA would like Dominic Harries and rrozza-apolitical to thank
  for discovering this vulnerability."
