description: "OPenFGA is an open source authorization/permission engine built for
  developers. OpenFGA versions v1.1.0 and prior is vulnerable to a DoS attack when
  Check and ListObjects calls are executed against authorization models that contain
  circular relationship definitions. Users are affected by this vulnerability if they
  are using OpenFGA v1.1.0 or earlier, and if you are executing `Check` or `ListObjects`
  calls against a vulnerable authorization model. Users are advised to upgrade to
  version 1.1.1. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. Users that
  do not have circular relationships in their models are not affected."
