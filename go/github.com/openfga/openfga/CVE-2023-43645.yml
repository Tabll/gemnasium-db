package_slug: "go/github.com/openfga/openfga"
title: "Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')"
description: "OpenFGA is an authorization/permission engine built for developers and
  inspired by Google Zanzibar. OpenFGA is vulnerable to a denial of service attack
  when certain Check calls are executed against authorization models that contain
  circular relationship definitions. When the call is made, it's possible for the
  server to exhaust resources and die. Users are advised to upgrade to v1.3.2 and
  update any offending models. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
  Note that for models which contained cycles or a relation definition that has the
  relation itself in its evaluation path, checks and queries that require evaluation
  will no longer be evaluated on v1.3.2+ and will return errors instead. Users who
  do not have cyclic models are unaffected."
