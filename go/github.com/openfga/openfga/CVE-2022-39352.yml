title: "OpenFGA Authorization Bypass"
description: "OpenFGA is a high-performance authorization/permission engine inspired
  by Google Zanzibar. Versions prior to 0.2.5 is vulnerable to authorization bypass
  under certain conditions. You are affected by this vulnerability if you added a
  tuple with a wildcard (*) assigned to a tupleset relation (the right hand side of
  a â€˜fromâ€™ statement). This issue has been patched in version v0.2.5. This update
  is not backward compatible with any authorization model that uses wildcard on a
  tupleset relation."
