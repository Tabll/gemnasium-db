package_slug: "go/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/s3/s3crypto"
title: "Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm"
description: "A vulnerability in the in-band key negotiation exists in the AWS S3
  Crypto SDK for GoLang versions prior to V2. An attacker with write access to the
  targeted bucket can change the encryption algorithm of an object in the bucket,
  which can then allow them to change AES-GCM to AES-CTR. Using this in combination
  with a decryption oracle can reveal the authentication key used by AES-GCM as decrypting
  the GMAC tag leaves the authentication key recoverable as an algebraic equation.
  It is recommended to update your SDK to V2 or later, and re-encrypt your files."
