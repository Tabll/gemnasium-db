title: "Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource"
description: "In Gitea before 1.16.9, it was possible for users to add existing issues
  to projects. Due to improper access controls, an attacker could assign any issue
  to any project in Gitea (there was no permission check for fetching the issue).
  As a result, the attacker would get access to private issue titles."
