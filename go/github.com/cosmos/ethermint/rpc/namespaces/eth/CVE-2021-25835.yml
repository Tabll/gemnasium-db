title: "Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay"
description: "Cosmos Network Ethermint <= v0.4.0 is affected by a cross-chain transaction
  replay vulnerability in the EVM module. Since ethermint uses the same chainIDEpoch
  and signature schemes with ethereum for compatibility, a verified signature in ethereum
  is still valid in ethermint with the same msg content and chainIDEpoch, which enables
  \"cross-chain transaction replay\" attack."
