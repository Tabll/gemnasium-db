title: "Cosmos packet-forward-middleware vulnerable to chain-halt"
description: "The Cosmos SDK is used for Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)
  applications and middleware. The [packet-forward-middleware](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-apps/tree/main/middleware/packet-forward-middleware)
  module is an IBC middleware module built for Cosmos blockchains utilizing the IBC
  protocol allowing routing of incoming IBC packets from a source chain to a destination
  chain. The `packet-forward-middleware` module is vulnerable to potential chain-halt
  due to error non-determinism.\n\n### Patches\nPlease patch at your earliest convenience
