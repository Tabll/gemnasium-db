title: "Interchain Security: The signers of ICS messages do not need to match the
  provider address "
description: "### Context\n\nICS has the following four messages that enable validators
  on the provider chain to perform different actions:\n\n- `MsgOptIn` -- adds a validator
  to the consumer chain’s active set\n- `MsgOptOut` -- removes a validator from the
  consumer chain’s active set \n- `MsgAssignConsumerKey` -- changes the consensus
  key used for a validator’s operations on a consumer chain\n- `MsgSetConsumerCommissionRate`
  -- sets a validator’s consumer-specific commission rate\n\nNormally, only the respective
  validators are allowed to perform these actions. \n\n### Issue\n\nThe upgrade to
  SDK 0.50, introduced a [signer](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.50/build/building-modules/protobuf-annotations#signer)
  field to these messages. This field is used to authenticate the user sending the
  message to the system. However, there was no validation on the ICS side to check
  if the signer matches the provider address.  \n\nAs a result, any user could opt-in,
  opt-out, change the commission rate, or change what public key a validator uses
  on a consumer chain. \n\nFor more context, check out the code:"
