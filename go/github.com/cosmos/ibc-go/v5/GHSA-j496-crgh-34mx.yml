title: "ibc-go: Potential Reentrancy using Timeout Callbacks in ibc-hooks"
description: "Through the deployment and subsequent use of a malicious CosmWasm contract
  via IBC interactions, an attacker could potentially execute the same `MsgTimeout`
  inside the IBC hook for the `OnTimeout` callback before the packet commitment is
  deleted. On chains where ibc-hooks wraps ICS-20, this vulnerability may allow for
  the logic of the `OnTimeout` callback of the transfer application to be recursively
  executed, leading to a condition that may present the opportunity for the loss of
  funds from the escrow account or unexpected minting of tokens."
