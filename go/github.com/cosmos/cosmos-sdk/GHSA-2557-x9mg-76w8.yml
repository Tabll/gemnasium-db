description: "## ASA-2024-002: Default `PrepareProposalHandler` may produce invalid
  proposals when used with default `SenderNonceMempool`\n\n**Component**: Cosmos SDK\n**Criticality**:
  Medium\n**Affected** Versions: Cosmos SDK versions <= 0.50.3; <= 0.47.8\n**Affected**
  Users: Chain developers, Validator and Node operators\n**Impact**: Denial of Service\n\n##
  Summary\n\nWhen using the default `PrepareProposalHandler` and the default `SenderNonceMempool`,
  an issue was identified which may allow invalid blocks to be proposed when a single
  sender includes multiple transactions with non-sequential sequence numbers in certain
  conditions. If this state is reached, it can lead to a reduction in block production
  for a network.\n\n## Next Steps for Impacted Parties\n\nIf you are a chain developer
  on an affected version of the Cosmos SDK, it is advised to update to the latest
  available version of the Cosmos SDK for your project.  Once a patched version is
  available, it is recommended that network operators upgrade.\n\nA Github Security
  Advisory for this issue is available in the Cosmos-SDK [repository](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/security/advisories).
