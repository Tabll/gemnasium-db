title: "Cosmos SDK's Integer Overflow vulnerability in its Validator Rewards pool
  can cause a chain halt"
description: "Description\nName: ISA-2025-005: Integer Overflow in Cosmos SDK\nComponent:
  CosmosSDK\nCriticality: High (Considerable Impact; Likely Likelihood per [ACMv1.2](https://github.com/interchainio/security/blob/main/resources/CLASSIFICATION_MATRIX.md))\nAffected
  versions: <= v0.50.13, <= 0.53.2\nAffected users: Validators, Full nodes, Users
  on chains that utilize the distribution module\nCosmos SDK chains in unpatched releases
  that use the x/distribution module are affected.\n\nDescription\nAn issue was discovered
  in the distribution module where a malicious deposit into the Validator Rewards
  pool would result in an integer overflow that would cause a chain halt. A malicious
  validator can interact with the distribution module to introduce this state.\n\nPatches\nHas
  the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?\n\nThe new Cosmos
  SDK release [v0.50.14](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.50.14)
  and [v0.53.3](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.53.3) fix this
  issue.\n\nThere are no known workarounds for this issue. It is advised that chains
  apply the update.\n\nThis issue was reported to the Cosmos Bug Bounty Program by
  `myte1111111` on HackerOne on April 15, 2025. If you believe you have found a bug
  in the Interchain Stack or would like to contribute to the program by reporting
