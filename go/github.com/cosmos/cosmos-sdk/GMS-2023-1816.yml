title: "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk's x/crisis does not charge ConstantFee"
description: "# x/crisis does not charge ConstantFee\n### Impact\nIf a transaction
  is sent to the `x/crisis` module to check an invariant, the ConstantFee parameter
  of the chain is NOT charged. All versions of the `x/crisis` module are affected
  on all versions of the Cosmos SDK.\n\n### Details\nThe `x/crisis` module is supposed
  to allow anyone to halt a chain in the event of a violated invariant by sending
  a `MsgVerifyInvariant` with the name of the invariant. Processing this message takes
  extra processing power hence a `ConstantFee` was introduced on the chain that is
  charged as extra from the reporter for the extra computational work. This is supposed
  to avert spammers on the chain making nodes do extra computations using this transaction.
  By not charging the `ConstantFee`, the transactions related to invariant checking
  are relatively cheaper compared to the computational need and other transactions.\n\nThat
  said, the submitter still has to pay the transaction fee to put the transaction
  on the network, hence using this weakness for spamming is limited by the usual mechanisms.\n\nSynthetic
  testing showed up to a 20% increase in CPU usage on a validator node that is spammed
  by hundreds of `MsgVerifyInvariant` messages which still makes this an expensive
  operation to carry out on a live blockchain network.\n\n### Patches\nThe `ConstantFee`
  charge of the `x/crisis` module will either be fixed or disabled in an upcoming
  regular release of the Cosmos SDK.\n\nThe `x/crisis` module was originally intended
  to allow chains to halt rather than continue with some unknown behavior in the case
  of an invariant violation (safety over liveness). However, as chains mature, and
  especially as the potential [cost of halting increases](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/issues/570),
  chains should consider carefully what invariants they really want to halt for, and
  what invariants are just sort of helpful sanity checks.\n\nThe SDK team is working
  on new modules that allow chain developers to fine-tune the chain invariants and
  the necessary actions.\n\nHence, the decision was made that the `x/crisis` module
  will be deprecated when new modules take over its responsibilities.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere
  is no workaround posted. Validators are advised to leave some extra computing room
  on their servers for possible spamming scenarios. (This is a good measure in any
  case.)\n\n### References\nSDK developer epic about invariant checking: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/15706\n"
