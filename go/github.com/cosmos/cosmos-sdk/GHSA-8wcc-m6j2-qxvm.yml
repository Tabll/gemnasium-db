title: "Transaction decoding may result in a stack overflow or resource exhaustion"
description: "ASA-2024-0012 When decoding a maliciously formed packet with a deeply-nested 
  structure, it may be possible for a stack overflow to occur and result in a network halt. 
  This was addressed by adding a recursion limit while decoding the packet.

  ASA-2024-0013 Nested messages in a transaction can consume exponential cpu and memory on
  UnpackAny calls. Themax_tx_bytes sets a limit for external TX but is not applied for 
  internal messages emitted by wasm contracts or a malicious validator block. This may 
  result in a node crashing due to resource exhaustion. This was addressed by adding 
  additional validation to prevent this condition."
