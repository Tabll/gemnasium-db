title: "Barberry Security Advisory - regarding x/auth periodic vesting accounts"
description: "### Impact\n\nIn `PeriodicVestingAccount`, defined in `x/auth`, an attacker
  can initialize a victim's account as a malicious vesting account, which allows deposits
  but does not allow withdrawals. When the user then deposits funds into their account,
  those funds are locked forever, and the user is not able to withdraw them.\n\n###
  Patches\n\n\\>= v0.46.13 for Cosmos SDK v0.46.x\n\\>= v0.47.3 for Cosmos SDK v0.47.x\n\nIf
  a network backported periodic vesting accounts to earlier versions of the SDK, those
  networks are affected too.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no workaround for this
  issue. Upgrade immediately.\n\n### References\n\n* Patched versions release notes:
  [v0.47.3](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/cfc757dc5043fb2758c47c146d2912fd010c1a45/RELEASE_NOTES.md#cosmos-sdk-v0473-release-notes),
