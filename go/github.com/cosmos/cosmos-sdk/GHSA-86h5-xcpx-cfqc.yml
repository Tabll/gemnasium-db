title: "ASA-2024-005: Potential slashing evasion during re-delegation"
description: "An issue was identified in the slashing mechanism that may allow for
  the evasion of slashing penalties during a slashing event. If a delegation contributed
  to byzantine behavior of a validator, and the validator has not yet been slashed,
  it may be possible for that delegation to evade a pending slashing penalty through
  re-delegation behavior. Additional validation logic was added to restrict this behavior."
