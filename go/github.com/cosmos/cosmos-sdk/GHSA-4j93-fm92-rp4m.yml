description: "## ASA-2024-003: Missing `BlockedAddressed` Validation in Vesting Module\n\n**Component**:
  Cosmos SDK\n**Criticality**: Low\n**Affected Versions**: Cosmos SDK versions <=
  0.50.3; <= 0.47.8\n**Affected Users**: Chain developers, Validator and Node operators\n**Impact**:
  Denial of Service\n\n## Description\n\nA vulnerability was identified in the `x/auth/vesting`
  module, which can allow a user to create a periodic vesting account on a blocked
  address, for example a non-initialized module account. Additional validation was
  added to prevent creation of a periodic vesting account in this scenario.\n\nIf
  this case is triggered, there is the potential for a chain halt if the uninitialized
  account in question is called by `GetModuleAccount` in `Begin`/`EndBlock` of a module.
  This combination of an uninitialized blocked module account is not common.  \n\n##
  Next Steps for Impacted Parties\n\nIf your chain has uninitialized blocked module
  accounts, it is recommended to proactively initialize them, as they are often initialized
  during a chain migration or during init genesis.\n\nIf you are a chain developer
  on an affected version of the Cosmos SDK, it is advised to update to the latest
  available version of the Cosmos SDK for your project.  Once a patched version is
  available, it is recommended that network operators upgrade.\n\nA Github Security
  Advisory for this issue is available in the Cosmos-SDK [repository](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/security/advisories).

  issue was found by [Dongsam](https://github.com/dongsam) who reported it to the
  Cosmos Bug Bounty Program on HackerOne on January 30, 2024. If you believe you have
