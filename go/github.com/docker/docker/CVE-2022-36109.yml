title: "Docker supplementary group permissions not set up properly, allowing attackers
  to bypass primary group restrictions"
description: "Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable software
  containerization. A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) where supplementary groups
  are not set up properly. If an attacker has direct access to a container and manipulates
  their supplementary group access, they may be able to use supplementary group access
  to bypass primary group restrictions in some cases, potentially gaining access to
  sensitive information or gaining the ability to execute code in that container.
  \ This bug is fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.18. Users should update to this
  version when it is available. Running containers should be stopped and restarted
  for the permissions to be fixed. For users unable to upgrade, this problem can be
  worked around by not using the `\"USER $USERNAME\"` Dockerfile instruction. Instead
  by calling `ENTRYPOINT [\"su\", \"-\", \"user\"]` the supplementary groups will
  be set up properly.\n\nThanks to Steven Murdoch for reporting this issue.\n\n----"
