package_slug: "go/github.com/docker/docker"
title: "Moby (Docker Engine) Insufficiently restricted permissions on data directory"
description: "A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) where the data directory (typically
  `/var/lib/docker`) contained subdirectories with insufficiently restricted permissions,
  allowing otherwise unprivileged Linux users to traverse directory contents and execute
  programs.  When containers included executable programs with extended permission
  bits (such as `setuid`), unprivileged Linux users could discover and execute those
  programs.  When the UID of an unprivileged Linux user on the host collided with
  the file owner or group inside a container, the unprivileged Linux user on the host
  could discover, read, and modify those files."
