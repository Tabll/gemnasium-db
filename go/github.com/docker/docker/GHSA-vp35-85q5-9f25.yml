title: "Container build can leak any path on the host into the container"
description: "Moby is the open source Linux container runtime and set of components
  used to build a variety of downstream container runtimes, including Docker CE, Mirantis
  Container Runtime (formerly Docker EE), and Docker Desktop. Moby allows for building
  container images using a set of build instructions (usually named and referred to
  as a \"Dockerfile\"), and a build context, which is not unlike the CWD in which
  the Dockerfile instructions are executed.\n\nContainers may be built using a variety
  of tools and build backends available in the Moby ecosystem; in all cases, builds
  may not include files outside of the build context (such as using absolute or relative-parent
  paths). This is enforced through both checks in the build backends, and the containerization
  of the build process itself.\n\nVersions of Git where CVE-2022-39253 is present
  and exploited by a malicious repository, when used in combination with Moby, are
  subject to an unexpected inclusion of arbitrary filesystem paths in the build context,
  without any visible warning to the user.\n\nThis issue was originally reported by
  Wenxiang Qian of Tencent Blade Team, and the root-cause analysis was performed by
  Cory Snider of Mirantis, with assistance from Bjorn Neergaard of the same. The issue
  was then reported to the Git project, and Taylor Blau led the process resolving
  the root issue in Git."
