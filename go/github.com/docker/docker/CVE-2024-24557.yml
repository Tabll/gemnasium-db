title: "Classic builder cache poisoning"
description: "The classic builder cache system is prone to cache poisoning if the
  image is built `FROM scratch`.\nAlso, changes to some instructions (most important
  being `HEALTHCHECK` and `ONBUILD`) would not cause a cache miss.\n\n\nAn attacker
  with the knowledge of the Dockerfile someone is using could poison their cache by
  making them pull a specially crafted image that would be considered as a valid cache
  candidate for some build steps.\n\nFor example, an attacker could create an image
  that is considered as a valid cache candidate for:\n```\nFROM scratch\nMAINTAINER
  Pawel\n```\n\nwhen in fact the malicious image used as a cache would be an image
  built from a different Dockerfile.\n\nIn the second case, the attacker could for
  example substitute a different `HEALTCHECK` command."
