title: "`docker cp` allows unexpected chmod of host files in Moby Docker Engine"
description: "A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) where attempting to copy files
  using `docker cp` into a specially-crafted container can result in Unix file permission
  changes for existing files in the hostâ€™s filesystem, widening access to others.
  This bug does not directly allow files to be read, modified, or executed without
  an additional cooperating process."
