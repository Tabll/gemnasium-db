description: "Intel's RAPL (Running Average Power Limit) feature, introduced by the
  Sandy Bridge microarchitecture, provides software insights into hardware energy

  kernel 3.13, which reads values via relevant MSRs (model specific registers) and
  provides unprivileged userspace access via `sysfs`."
