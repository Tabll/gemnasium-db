description: "Intel's RAPL (Running Average Power Limit) feature, introduced by the
  Sandy Bridge microarchitecture, provides software insights into hardware energy
  consumption. To facilitate this, Intel introduced the powercap framework in Linux
  kernel 3.13, which reads values via relevant MSRs (model specific registers) and
  provides unprivileged userspace access via `sysfs`."
