title: "Moby firewalld reload removes bridge network isolation"
description: "Moby is an open source container framework developed by Docker Inc.
  that is distributed as Docker Engine, Mirantis Container Runtime, and various other
  downstream projects/products. The Moby daemon component (dockerd), which is developed
  as [moby/moby](https://github.com/moby/moby) is commonly referred to as Docker,
  or Docker Engine.\n\nFirewalld is a daemon used by some Linux distributions to provide
  a dynamically managed firewall. When Firewalld is running, Docker uses its iptables
  backend to create rules, including rules to isolate containers in one bridge network
  from containers in other bridge networks."
