title: "Docker Notary Signature Algorithm Not Matched to Key vulnerability"
description: "In Docker Notary before 0.1, gotuf/signed/verify.go has a Signature
  Algorithm Not Matched to Key vulnerability. Because an attacker controls the field
  specifying the signature algorithm, they might (for example) be able to forge a
  signature by forcing a misinterpretation of an RSA-PSS key as Ed25519 elliptic-curve
  data."
