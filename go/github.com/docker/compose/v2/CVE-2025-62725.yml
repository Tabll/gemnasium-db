title: "Docker Compose Vulnerable to Path Traversal via OCI Artifact Layer Annotations"
description: "Docker Compose trusts the path information embedded in remote OCI compose
  artifacts. When a layer includes the annotations com.docker.compose.extends or com.docker.compose.envfile,
  Compose joins the attacker‑supplied value from com.docker.compose.file/com.docker.compose.envfile
  with its local cache directory and writes the file there."
