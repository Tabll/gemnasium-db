title: "Beego allows Reflected/Stored XSS in Beego's RenderForm() Function Due to
  Unescaped User Input"
description: "A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Beego's `RenderForm()`
  function due to improper HTML escaping of user-controlled data. This vulnerability
  allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in victims' browsers,
  potentially leading to session hijacking, credential theft, or account takeover.
  The vulnerability affects any application using Beego's `RenderForm()` function
  with user-provided data. Since it is a high-level function generating an entire
  form markup, many developers would assume it automatically escapes attributes (the
  way most frameworks do)."
