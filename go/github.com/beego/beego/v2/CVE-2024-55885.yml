title: "Beego has Collision Hazards of MD5 in Cache Key Filenames"
description: "In the context of using MD5 to generate filenames for cache keys, there
  are significant collision hazards that need to be considered. MD5, or Message Digest
  Algorithm 5, is a widely known cryptographic hash function that produces a 128-bit
  hash value. However, MD5 is no longer considered secure against well-funded opponents
  due to its vulnerability to collision attacks."
