title: "Access control bypass in beego"
description: "The route lookup process in beego through 1.12.4 and 2.x through 2.0.2
  allows attackers to bypass access control. When a /p1/p2/:name route is configured,
  attackers can access it by appending .xml in various places (e.g., p1.xml instead
  of p1)."
