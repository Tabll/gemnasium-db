title: "Fiber Crashes in BodyParser Due to Unvalidated Large Slice Index in Decoder"
description: "When using Fiber's `Ctx.BodyParser` to parse form data containing a
  large numeric key that represents a slice index (e.g., `test.18446744073704`), the
  application crashes due to an out-of-bounds slice allocation in the underlying schema
  decoder.\n\nThe root cause is that the decoder attempts to allocate a slice of length
  `idx + 1` without validating whether the index is within a safe or reasonable range.
  If `idx` is excessively large, this leads to an integer overflow or memory exhaustion,
  causing a panic or crash."
