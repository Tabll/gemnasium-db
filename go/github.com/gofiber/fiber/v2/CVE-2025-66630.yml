title: "Fiber has an insecure fallback in utils.UUIDv4() / utils.UUID() — predictable
  / zero‑UUID on crypto/rand failure"
description: "Fiber v2 contains an internal vendored copy of `gofiber/utils`, and
  its functions `UUIDv4()` and `UUID()` inherit the same critical weakness described
  in the upstream advisory. On **Go versions prior to 1.24**, the underlying `crypto/rand`
  implementation **can return an error** if secure randomness cannot be obtained.
  In such cases, these Fiber v2 UUID functions silently fall back to generating predictable
  values — the all-zero UUID `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`.\n\nOn Go **1.24+**,
  the language guarantees that `crypto/rand` no longer returns an error (it will block
  or panic instead), so this vulnerability primarily affects **Fiber v2 users running
  Go 1.23 or earlier**, which Fiber v2 officially supports.\n\nBecause no error is
  returned by the Fiber v2 UUID functions, application code may unknowingly rely on
  *predictable, repeated, or low-entropy identifiers* in security-critical pathways.
  This is especially impactful because many Fiber v2 middleware components (session
  middleware, CSRF, rate limiting, request-ID generation, etc.) **default to using
  `utils.UUIDv4()`**.\n\nImpact includes, but is not limited to:\n\n* **Session fixation
  or hijacking** (predictable session IDs)\n* **CSRF token forgery** or bypass\n*
  **Authentication replay / token prediction**\n* **Potential denial-of-service (DoS):**
  if the zero UUID is generated, key-based structures (sessions, rate-limits, caches,
  CSRF stores) may collapse into a single shared key, causing overwrites, lock contention,
  or state corruption\n* **Request-ID collisions**, undermining logging and trace
  integrity\n* **General compromise** of confidentiality, integrity, and authorization
  logic relying on UUIDs for uniqueness or secrecy\n\nAll Fiber v2 versions containing
  the internal `utils.UUIDv4()` / `utils.UUID()` implementation are affected when
  running on **Go <1.24**. **No patched Fiber v2 release currently exists.**\n\n---"
