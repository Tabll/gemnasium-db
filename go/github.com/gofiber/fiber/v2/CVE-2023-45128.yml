title: "Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision"
description: "Fiber is an express inspired web framework written in Go. A Cross-Site
  Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability has been identified in the application, which
  allows an attacker to inject arbitrary values and forge malicious requests on behalf
  of a user. This vulnerability can allow an attacker to inject arbitrary values without
  any authentication, or perform various malicious actions on behalf of an authenticated
  user, potentially compromising the security and integrity of the application. The
  vulnerability is caused by improper validation and enforcement of CSRF tokens within
  the application. This issue has been addressed in version 2.50.0 and users are advised
  to upgrade. Users should take additional security measures like captchas or Two-Factor
  Authentication (2FA) and set Session cookies with SameSite=Lax or SameSite=Secure,
  and the Secure and HttpOnly attributes as defense in depth measures. There are no
  known workarounds for this vulnerability."
