package_slug: "go/github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2"
title: "Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking"
description: "Fiber is an express inspired web framework written in Go. A Cross-Site
  Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability has been identified in the application, which
  allows an attacker to obtain tokens and forge malicious requests on behalf of a
  user. This can lead to unauthorized actions being taken on the user's behalf, potentially
  compromising the security and integrity of the application. The vulnerability is
  caused by improper validation and enforcement of CSRF tokens within the application.
  This vulnerability has been addressed in version 2.50.0 and users are advised to
  upgrade. Users should take additional security measures like captchas or Two-Factor
  Authentication (2FA) and set Session cookies with SameSite=Lax or SameSite=Secure,
  and the Secure and HttpOnly attributes."
