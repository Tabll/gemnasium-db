title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "This package provides universal methods to use multiple template engines
  with the Fiber web framework using the Views interface. This vulnerability specifically
  impacts web applications that render user-supplied data through this template engine,
  potentially leading to the execution of malicious scripts in users' browsers when
  visiting affected web pages. The vulnerability has been addressed, the template
  engine now defaults to having autoescape set to `true`, effectively mitigating the
  risk of XSS attacks.\n"
