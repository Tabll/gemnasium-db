title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "github.com/crewjam/saml is a saml library for the go language. In affected
  versions the package does not validate the ACS Location URI according to the SAML
  binding being parsed. If abused, this flaw allows attackers to register malicious
  Service Providers at the IdP and inject Javascript in the ACS endpoint definition,
  achieving Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) in the IdP context during the redirection at
  the end of a SAML SSO Flow. Consequently, an attacker may perform any authenticated
  action as the victim once the victimâ€™s browser loaded the SAML IdP initiated SSO
  link for the malicious service provider. Note: SP registration is commonly an unrestricted
  operation in IdPs, hence not requiring particular permissions or publicly accessible
  to ease the IdP interoperability. This issue is fixed in version 0.4.14. Users unable
  to upgrade may perform external validation of URLs provided in SAML metadata, or
  restrict the ability for end-users to upload arbitrary metadata."
