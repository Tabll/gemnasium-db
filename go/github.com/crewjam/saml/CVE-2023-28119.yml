package_slug: "go/github.com/crewjam/saml"
title: "Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling"
description: "The crewjam/saml go library contains a partial implementation of the
  SAML standard in golang. Prior to version 0.4.13, the package's use of `flate.NewReader`
  does not limit the size of the input. The user can pass more than 1 MB of data in
  the HTTP request to the processing functions, which will be decompressed server-side
  using the Deflate algorithm. Therefore, after repeating the same request multiple
  times, it is possible to achieve a reliable crash since the operating system kills
  the process. This issue is patched in version 0.4.13."
