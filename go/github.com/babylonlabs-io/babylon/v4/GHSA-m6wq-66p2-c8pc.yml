title: "Babylon Nil BlockHash in BLS vote extensions triggers panics in consensus
  handlers"
description: "A vulnerability exists in Babylon’s BLS vote extension processing where
  a malicious active validator can submit a VoteExtension with the `block_hash` field
  omitted from the protobuf serialization. Because protobuf fields are optional, unmarshalling
  succeeds but leaves `BlockHash` as nil. Babylon then dereferences this nil pointer
  in consensus-critical code paths (notably `VerifyVoteExtension`, and also proposal-time
  vote verification), causing a runtime panic."
