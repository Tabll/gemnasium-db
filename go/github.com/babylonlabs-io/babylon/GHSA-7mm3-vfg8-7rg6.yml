title: "Babylon Finality Provider `MsgCommitPubRandList` replay attack"
description: "A high vulnerability exists in the Babylon protocol's x/finality module
  due to a lack of domain separation in signed messages, combined with insufficient
  validation in the MsgCommitPubRandList handler. Specifically, the handler does not
  enforce that the submitted Commitment field is 32 bytes long. This allows an attacker
  to replay a signature originally generated for a different message (e.g., a Proof-of-Possession
  in MsgCreateFinalityProvider) as a MsgCommitPubRandList. By crafting the message
  parameters, an attacker can use the typically 20-byte address bytes (from the PoP
  context) to form the StartHeight, NumPubRand, and a shorter-than-expected Commitment
  (e.g., 4 bytes). The replayed signature will pass verification for this crafted
  message, leading to the injection of an invalid PubRand commitment."
