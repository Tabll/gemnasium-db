title: "Babylon Integer Overflow in Distribution Module CumulativeRewardRatio Calculation
  Leading to Chain Halt"
description: "Minting large amount of tokens through ibc transfer and then depositing
  them in validator rewards pool (via `DepositValidatorRewardsPool` message) can lead
  to integer overflow panic when calculating `cumulative_reward_ratio` for the validator.\n\nThis
  calculation happens in `x/epoching` module `EndBlocker`, thus the panic will halt
  the chain."
