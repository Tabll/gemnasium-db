description: "memos is a privacy-first, lightweight note-taking service. In memos
  0.13.2, an SSRF vulnerability exists at the `/o/get/image` that allows unauthenticated
  users to enumerate the internal network and retrieve images. The response from the
  image request is then copied into the response of the current server request, causing
  a reflected XSS vulnerability. Version 0.22.0 of memos removes the vulnerable file."
