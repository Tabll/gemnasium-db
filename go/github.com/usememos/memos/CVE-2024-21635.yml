title: "Memos' Access Tokens Stay Valid after User Password Change"
description: "Access Tokens are used to authenticate application access. When a user
  changes their password, the existing list of Access Tokens stay valid instead of
  expiring. If a user finds that their account has been compromised, they can update
  their password.\n\nThe bad actor though will still have access to their account
  because the bad actor's Access Token stays on the list as a valid token. The user
  will have to manually delete the bad actor's Access Token to secure their account.
  The list of Access Tokens has a generic Description which makes it hard to pinpoint
  a bad actor in a list of Access Tokens."
