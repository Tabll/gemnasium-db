package_slug: "go/github.com/usememos/memos"
title: "Memos has Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability in Image URLs"
description: "The Memos application, up to version v0.24.3, allows for the embedding
  of markdown images with arbitrary URLs. When a user views a memo containing such
  an image, their browser automatically fetches the image URL without explicit user
  consent or interaction beyond viewing the memo. This can be exploited by an attacker
  to disclose the viewing user's IP address, browser User-Agent string, and potentially
  other request-specific information to the attacker-controlled server, leading to
  information disclosure and user tracking."
