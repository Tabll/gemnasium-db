package_slug: "go/github.com/t2bot/matrix-media-repo"
title: "Matrix Media Repo (MMR) allows untrusted file formats can be thumbnailed,
  invoking potentially further untrusted decoders"
description: "If SVG or JPEGXL thumbnailers are enabled (they are disabled by default),
  a user may upload a file which claims to be either of these types and request a
  thumbnail to invoke a different decoder in ImageMagick. In some ImageMagick installations,
  this includes the capability to run Ghostscript to decode the image/file.\n\nIf
  MP4 thumbnailers are enabled (also disabled by default), the same issue as above
  may occur with the ffmpeg installation instead.\n\nMMR uses a number of other decoders
  for all other file types when preparing thumbnails. Theoretical issues are possible
  with these decoders, however in testing they were not possible to exploit."
