package_slug: "go/github.com/t2bot/matrix-media-repo"
title: "matrix-media-repo (MMR) allows unauthenticated writes to the media repository,
  which may allow planting of problematic content"
description: "MMR before version 1.3.5 allows, by design, unauthenticated remote participants
  to trigger a download and caching of remote media from a remote homeserver to the
  local media repository. Such content then also becomes available for download from
  the local homeserver in an unauthenticated way. The implication is that unauthenticated
  remote adversaries can use this functionality to plant problematic content into
  the media repository."
