title: "Some CORS middleware allow untrusted origins"
description: "Some CORS middleware (more specifically those created by specifying
  two or more origin patterns whose hosts share a proper suffix) incorrectly allow
  some untrusted origins, thereby opening the door to cross-origin attacks from the
  untrusted origins in question.\n\nFor example, specifying origin patterns `https://foo.com`
  and `https://bar.com` (in that order) would yield a middleware that would incorrectly
  allow untrusted origin `https://barfoo.com`."
