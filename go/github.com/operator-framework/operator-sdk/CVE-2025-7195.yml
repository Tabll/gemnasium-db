package_slug: "go/github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk"
title: "operator-sdk: privilege escalation due to incorrect permissions of /etc/passwd"
description: "Early versions of Operator-SDK provided an insecure method to allow
  operator containers to run in environments that used a random UID. Operator-SDK
  before 0.15.2 provided a script, user_setup, which modifies the permissions of the
  /etc/passwd file to 664 during build time. Developers who used Operator-SDK before
  0.15.2 to scaffold their operator may still be impacted by this if the insecure
  user_setup script is still being used to build new container images. In affected
  images, the /etc/passwd file was created during build time with group-writable permissions
  and a group ownership of root (gid=0). An attacker who can execute commands within
  an affected container, even as a non-root user, may be able to leverage their membership
  in the root group to modify the /etc/passwd file. This could allow the attacker
  to add a new user with any arbitrary UID, including UID 0, leading to full root
  privileges within the container."
