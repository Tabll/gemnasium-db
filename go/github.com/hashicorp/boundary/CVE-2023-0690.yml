description: "HashiCorp Boundary from 0.10.0 through 0.11.2 contain an issue where
  when using a PKI-based worker with a Key Management Service (KMS) defined in the
  configuration file, new credentials created after an automatic rotation may not
  have been encrypted via the intended KMS. This would result in the credentials being
  stored in plaintext on the Boundary PKI workerâ€™s disk. This issue is fixed in version
  0.12.0."
