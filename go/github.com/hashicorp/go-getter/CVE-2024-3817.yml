title: "HashiCorp go-getter Vulnerable to Argument Injection When Fetching Remote
  Default Git Branches"
description: "When go-getter is performing a Git operation, go-getter will try to
  clone the given repository. If a Git reference is not passed along with the Git
  url, go-getter will then try to check the remote repositoryâ€™s HEAD reference of
  its default branch by passing arguments to the Git binary on the host it is executing
  on.\n\nAn attacker may format a Git URL in order to inject additional Git arguments
  to the Git call.\n\nConsumers of the go-getter library should evaluate the risk
  associated with these issues in the context of their go-getter usage and upgrade
  go-getter to 1.7.4 or later."
