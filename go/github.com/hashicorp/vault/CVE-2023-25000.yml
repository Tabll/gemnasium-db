package_slug: "go/github.com/hashicorp/vault"
title: "Observable Discrepancy"
description: "HashiCorp Vault's implementation of Shamir's secret sharing used precomputed
  table lookups, and was vulnerable to cache-timing attacks. An attacker with access
  to, and the ability to observe a large number of unseal operations on the host through
  a side channel may reduce the search space of a brute force effort to recover the
  Shamir shares. Fixed in Vault 1.13.1, 1.12.5, and 1.11.9."
