title: "Hashicorp Vault vulnerable to denial of service through memory exhaustion"
description: "Vault Community and Vault Enterprise (“Vault”) clusters using Vault’s
  Integrated Storage backend are vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack through
  memory exhaustion through a Raft cluster join API endpoint. An attacker may send
  a large volume of requests to the endpoint which may cause Vault to consume excessive
  system memory resources, potentially leading to a crash of the underlying system
  and the Vault process itself.\n\nThis vulnerability, CVE-2024-8185, is fixed in
  Vault Community 1.18.1 and Vault Enterprise 1.18.1, 1.17.8, and 1.16.12."
