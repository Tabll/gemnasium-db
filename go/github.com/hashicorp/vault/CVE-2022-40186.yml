title: "HashiCorp Vault vulnerable to incorrect metadata access"
description: "An issue was discovered in HashiCorp Vault and Vault Enterprise before
  1.11.3. A vulnerability in the Identity Engine was found where, in a deployment
  where an entity has multiple mount accessors with shared alias names, Vault may
  overwrite metadata to the wrong alias due to an issue with checking the proper alias
  assigned to an entity. This may allow for unintended access to key/value paths using
  that metadata in Vault."
