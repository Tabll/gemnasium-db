package_slug: "go/github.com/gohugoio/hugo"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command
  Injection')"
description: "Hugo is a fast and Flexible Static Site Generator built in Go. Hugo
  depends on Go's `os/exec` for certain features, e.g. for rendering of Pandoc documents
  if these binaries are found in the system `%PATH%` on Windows. In Hugo before version
  0.79.1, if a malicious file with the same name (`exe` or `bat`) is found in the
  current working directory at the time of running `hugo`, the malicious command will
  be invoked instead of the system one. Windows users who run `hugo` inside untrusted
  Hugo sites are affected. Users should upgrade to Hugo v0.79.1. Other than avoiding
  untrusted Hugo sites, there is no workaround."
