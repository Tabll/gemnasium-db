description: "When ORT (now via atstccfg) generates ip_allow.config files in Apache
  Traffic Control 3.0.0 to 3.1.0 and 4.0.0 to 4.1.0, those files include permissions
  that allow bad actors to push arbitrary content into and remove arbitrary content
  from CDN cache servers. Additionally, these permissions are potentially extended
  to IP addresses outside the desired range, resulting in them being granted to clients
  possibly outside the CDN arcitechture."
