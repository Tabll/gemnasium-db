identifier: "CVE-2017-7670"
package_slug: "go/github.com/apache/trafficcontrol"
title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "The Traffic Router component of the incubating Apache Traffic Control
  project is vulnerable to a Slowloris style Denial of Service attack. TCP connections
  made on the configured DNS port will remain in the `ESTABLISHED` state until the
  client explicitly closes the connection or Traffic Router is restarted. If connections
  remain in the `ESTABLISHED` state indefinitely and accumulate in number to match
  the size of the thread pool dedicated to processing DNS requests, the thread pool
  becomes exhausted. Once the thread pool is exhausted, Traffic Router is unable to
  service any DNS request, regardless of transport protocol."
