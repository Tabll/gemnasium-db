title: "Apache Solr Operator liveness and readiness probes may leak basic auth credentials"
description: "Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File vulnerability in the
  Apache Solr Operator.\n\nThis issue affects all versions of the Apache Solr Operator
  from 0.3.0 through 0.8.0.\n\nWhen asked to bootstrap Solr security, the operator
  will enable basic authentication and create several accounts for accessing Solr:
  including the \"solr\" and \"admin\" accounts for use by end-users, and a \"k8s-oper\"
  account which the operator uses for its own requests to Solr.\nOne common source
  of these operator requests is healthchecks: liveness, readiness, and startup probes
  are all used to determine Solr's health and ability to receive traffic.\nBy default,
  the operator configures the Solr APIs used for these probes to be exempt from authentication,
  but users may specifically request that authentication be required on probe endpoints
  as well.\nWhenever one of these probes would fail, if authentication was in use,
  the Solr Operator would create a Kubernetes \"event\" containing the username and
  password of the \"k8s-oper\" account.\n\nWithin the affected version range, this
  vulnerability affects any solrcloud resource which (1) bootstrapped security through
  use of the `.solrOptions.security.authenticationType=basic` option, and (2) required
  authentication be used on probes by setting `.solrOptions.security.probesRequireAuth=true`.\n\nUsers
  are recommended to upgrade to Solr Operator version 0.8.1, which fixes this issue
  by ensuring that probes no longer print the credentials used for Solr requests. 
  Users may also mitigate the vulnerability by disabling authentication on their healthcheck
  probes using the setting `.solrOptions.security.probesRequireAuth=false`."
