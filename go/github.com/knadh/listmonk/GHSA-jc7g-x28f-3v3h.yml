title: "listmonk's Sprig template Injection vulnerability leads to reading of Environment
  Variable for low privilege user"
description: "The `env` and `expandenv` template functions which is enabled by default
  in [Sprig](https://masterminds.github.io/sprig/) enables capturing of env variables
  on host. While this may not be a problem on single-user (super admin) installations,
  on multi-user installations, this allows non-super-admin users with campaign or
  template permissions to use the `{{ env }}` template expression to capture sensitive
  environment variables.\n\n**Upgrade to [v5.0.2](https://github.com/knadh/listmonk/releases/tag/v5.0.2)**
  to mitigate.\n\n---------"
