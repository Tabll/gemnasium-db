title: "listmonk: CSRF to XSS Chain can Lead to Admin Account Takeover"
description: "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user
  to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they’re currently authenticated.
  With a little help of social engineering (such as sending a link via email or chat),
  an attacker may trick the users of a web application into executing actions of the
  attacker’s choosing. If the victim is a normal user, a successful CSRF attack can
  force the user to perform state changing requests like transferring funds, changing
  their email address, and so forth. If the victim is an administrative account, CSRF
  can compromise the entire web application."
