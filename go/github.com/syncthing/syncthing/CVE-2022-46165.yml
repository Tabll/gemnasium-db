package_slug: "go/github.com/syncthing/syncthing"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "Syncthing is an open source, continuous file synchronization program.
  In versions prior to 1.23.5 a compromised instance with shared folders could sync
  malicious files which contain arbitrary HTML and JavaScript in the name. If the
  owner of another device looks over the shared folder settings and moves the mouse
  over the latest sync, a script could be executed to change settings for shared folders
  or add devices automatically. Additionally adding a new device with a malicious
  name could embed HTML or JavaScript inside parts of the page. As a result the webUI
  may be subject to a stored cross site scripting attack. This issue has been addressed
  in version 1.23.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should
  avoid sharing folders with untrusted users."
