title: "LF Edge eKuiper vulnerable to File Path Traversal leading to file replacement"
description: "Path traversal is also known as directory traversal. These vulnerabilities
  enable an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server that is running an application.
  In this case, an attacker might be able to write to arbitrary files on the server,
  allowing them to modify application data or behavior, and ultimately take full control
  of the server."
