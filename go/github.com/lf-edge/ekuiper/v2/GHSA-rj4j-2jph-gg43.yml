title: "LF Edge eKuiper is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Read/Write via unsanitized
  names and zip extraction"
description: "Multiple path traversal and unsafe path handling vulnerabilities were
  discovered in eKuiper prior to the fixes implemented in PR [lf-edge/ekuiper#3911](https://github.com/lf-edge/ekuiper/pull/3911).
  The issues allow attacker-controlled input (rule names, schema versions, plugin
  names, uploaded file names, and ZIP entries) to influence file system paths used
  by the application. In vulnerable deployments, this can permit files to be created,
  overwritten, or extracted outside the intended directories, potentially enabling
  disclosure of sensitive files, tampering with configuration or plugin binaries,
  denial of service, or other host compromise scenarios.\n\nSeveral components used
  unvalidated user input when constructing filesystem paths or when extracting archives.
  In each case, input was accepted and used directly in path operations (join, create,
  delete, extract) without sufficient sanitization or canonicalization, allowing the
  input to include path separators, `..` segments, or absolute paths."
