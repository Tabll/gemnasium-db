title: "Duplicate Advisory: EVE Doesn't Measure Config Partition From 2 Fronts"
description: "### Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it
  is a duplicate of GHSA-phcg-h58r-gmcq. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n### Original Description\nPCR14 is not in the list of PCRs that seal/unseal
  the “vault” key, but\ndue to the change that was implemented in commit\n“7638364bc0acf8b5c481b5ce5fea11ad44ad7fd4”,
  fixing this issue alone would not solve the\nproblem of the config partition not
  being measured correctly.\n\nAlso, the “vault” key is sealed/unsealed with SHA1
  PCRs instead of\nSHA256. \nThis issue was somewhat mitigated due to all of the PCR
  extend functions\nupdating both the values of SHA256 and SHA1 for a given PCR ID.\n\nHowever,
  due to the change that was implemented in commit\n“7638364bc0acf8b5c481b5ce5fea11ad44ad7fd4”,
  this is no longer the case for PCR14, as\nthe code in “measurefs.go” explicitly
  updates only the SHA256 instance of PCR14, which\nmeans that even if PCR14 were
  to be added to the list of PCRs sealing/unsealing the “vault”\nkey, changes to the
  config partition would still not be measured.\n\n\n\nAn attacker could modify the
  config partition without triggering the measured boot, this could\nresult in the
  attacker gaining full control over the device with full access to the contents of
  the\nencrypted “vault”"
