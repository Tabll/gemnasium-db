title: "Duplicate Advisory: EVE's Debug Functions Unlockable Without Triggering Measured
  Boot"
description: "### Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it
  is a duplicate of GHSA-4c4v-42hc-72p6. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n### Original Description\nOn boot, the Pillar eve container checks
  for the existence and content of\n“/config/GlobalConfig/global.json”.\n\nIf the
  file exists, it overrides the existing configuration on the device on boot.\n\nThis
  allows an attacker to change the system’s configuration, which also includes some\ndebug
  functions.\n\nThis could be used to unlock the ssh with custom “authorized_keys”
  via the\n“debug.enable.ssh” key, similar to the “authorized_keys” finding that was
  noted before.\n\nOther usages include unlocking the usb to enable the keyboard via
  the “debug.enable.usb”\nkey, allowing VNC access via the “app.allow.vnc” key, and
  more.\n\nAn attacker could easily enable these debug functionalities without triggering
  the “measured\nboot” mechanism implemented by EVE OS, and without marking the device
  as “UUD”\n(“Unknown Update Detected”).\nThis is because the “/config” partition
  is not protected by “measured boot”, it is mutable and it\nis not encrypted in any
  way.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn attacker can gain full control over the device without changing
  the PCR values, thereby not\ntriggering the “measured boot” mechanism, and having
  full access to the vault.\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\nThis issue was partially fixed in these
  commits (after disclosure to Zededa), where the config\npartition measurement was
  added to PCR13:\n\n• aa3501d6c57206ced222c33aea15a9169d629141\n\n• 5fef4d92e75838cc78010edaed5247dfbdae1889.\n\nThis
  issue was made viable in version 9.0.0 when the calculation was moved to PCR14 but
  it was not included in the measured boot."
