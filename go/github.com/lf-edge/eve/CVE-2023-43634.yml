title: "EVE Doesn't Protect Config Partition with Measured Boot"
description: "Config partition measurement was moved from PCR 13 to PCR 14 in a commit,
  but PCR 14 was not added to the list of PCRs that seal/unseal the vault key. As
  a result, an attacker can remove the disk, use another server to modify the files
  in the config partition, and then re-insert the disk."
