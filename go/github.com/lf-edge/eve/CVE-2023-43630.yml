title: "EVE Doesn't Measure Config Partition From 2 Fronts"
description: "PCR14 is not included in the list of PCRs that seal/unseal the vault
  key. Additionally, the vault key uses SHA1 PCRs instead of SHA256.\nThus an attacker
  with physical access can take out the disk, use a different computer to modify the
  files in the /config partition, and re-insert the disk and boot without the change
  being detected by measured boot and remote attestation."
