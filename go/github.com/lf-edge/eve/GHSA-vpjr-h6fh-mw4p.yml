title: "Duplicate Advisory: EVE Freely Allocates Buffer on The Stack With Data From
  Socket"
description: "### Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it
  is a duplicate of GHSA-phcg-h58r-gmcq. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n### Original Description\nAs noted in the “VTPM.md” file in the eve
  documentation, “VTPM is a server listening on port\n8877 in EVE, exposing limited
  functionality of the TPM to the clients. \nVTPM allows clients to\nexecute tpm2-tools
  binaries from a list of hardcoded options”\nThe communication with this server is
  done using protobuf, and the data is comprised of 2\nparts:\n\n1. Header\n\n2. Data\n\nWhen
  a connection is made, the server is waiting for 4 bytes of data, which will be the
  header,\nand these 4 bytes would be parsed as uint32 size of the actual data to
  come.\n\nThen, in the function “handleRequest” this size is then used in order to
  allocate a payload on\nthe stack for the incoming data.\n\nAs this payload is allocated
  on the stack, this will allow overflowing the stack size allocated for\nthe relevant
  process with freely controlled data.\n\n* An attacker can crash the system. \n*
  An attacker can gain control over the system, specifically on the “vtpm_server”
  process\nwhich has very high privileges."
