title: "Duplicate Advisory: EVE Doesn't Protect Config Partition with Measured Boot"
description: "### Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it
  is a duplicate of GHSA-wc42-fcjp-v8vq. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n### Original Description\nWhen sealing/unsealing the “vault” key,
  a list of PCRs is used, which defines which PCRs\nare used.\n\nIn a previous project,
  CYMOTIVE found that the configuration is not protected by the secure\nboot, and
  in response Zededa implemented measurements on the config partition that was\nmapped
  to PCR 13.\n\nIn that process, PCR 13 was added to the list of PCRs that seal/unseal
  the key.\n\nIn commit “56e589749c6ff58ded862d39535d43253b249acf”, the config partition\nmeasurement
  moved from PCR 13 to PCR 14, but PCR 14 was not added to the list of\nPCRs that
  seal/unseal the key.\n\nThis change makes the measurement of PCR 14 effectively
  redundant as it would not affect\nthe sealing/unsealing of the key.\n\n\n\nAn attacker
  could modify the config partition without triggering the measured boot, this could\nresult
  in the attacker gaining full control over the device with full access to the contents
  of the\nencrypted “vault”"
