title: "EVE: SSH as Root Unlockable Without Triggering Measured Boot"
description: "On boot, the Pillar container checks for /config/authorized_keys. If
  present with a valid public key, it enables SSH on port 22 with root login. The
  /config partition is not protected by measured boot, is mutable and unencrypted.\n\nThis
  enables an attacker with physical access to the device to take out the disk, modify
  the /config partition using a separate server, then insert it, without the inserted
  key being flagged as an integrity voilation my measured boot and remote attestation."
