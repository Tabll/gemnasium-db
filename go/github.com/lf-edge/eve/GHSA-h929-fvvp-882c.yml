title: "Duplicate Advisory: EVE Seals Vault Key With SHA1 PCRs"
description: "### Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it
  is a duplicate of GHSA-wc42-fcjp-v8vq. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n### Original Description\nVault Key Sealed With SHA1 PCRs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe
  measured boot solution implemented in EVE OS leans on a PCR locking mechanism.\n\nDifferent
  parts of the system update different PCR values in the TPM, resulting in a unique\nvalue
  for each PCR entry.\n\nThese PCRs are then used in order to seal/unseal a key from
  the TPM which is used to\nencrypt/decrypt the “vault” directory.\n\nThis “vault”
  directory is the most sensitive point in the system and as such, its content should\nbe
  protected.\n\nThis mechanism is noted in Zededa’s documentation as the “measured
  boot” mechanism,\ndesigned to protect said “vault”.\n\nThe code that’s responsible
  for generating and fetching the key from the TPM assumes that\nSHA256 PCRs are used
  in order to seal/unseal the key, and as such their presence is being\nchecked.\n\nThe
  issue here is that the key is not sealed using SHA256 PCRs, but using SHA1 PCRs.\nThis
  leads to several issues:\n\n• Machines that have their SHA256 PCRs enabled but SHA1
  PCRs disabled, as well\nas not sealing their keys at all, meaning the “vault” is
  not protected from an attacker.\n\n• SHA1 is considered insecure and reduces the
  complexity level required to unseal the\nkey in machines which have their SHA1 PCRs
  enabled.\n\n\n\nAn attacker can very easily retrieve the contents of the “vault”,
  which will effectively render\nthe “measured boot” mechanism meaningless."
