package_slug: "go/github.com/lf-edge/eve/pkg/grub"
title: "EVE Doesn't Protect Rootfs"
description: "Measured boot validates BIOS, grub, kernel cmdline, and initrd but not
  the entire rootfs. Thus, an attacker can create an EVE-OS rootfs squashfs image
  with some files modified and take out the disk and replace the existing rootfs image
  without that being detected by measure boot and remote attestation."
