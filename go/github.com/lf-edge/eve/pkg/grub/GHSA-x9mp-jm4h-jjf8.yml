title: "Duplicate Advisory: EVE Doesn't Protect Rootfs"
description: "### Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it
  is a duplicate of GHSA-wc42-fcjp-v8vq. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n### Original Description\nIn EVE OS, the “measured boot” mechanism
  prevents a compromised device from accessing\nthe encrypted data located in the
  vault.\n\nAs per the “measured boot” design, the PCR values calculated at different
  stages of the boot\nprocess will change if any of their respective parts are changed.\n\nThis
  includes, among other things, the configuration of the bios, grub, the kernel cmdline,\ninitrd,
  and more.\n\nHowever, this mechanism does not validate the entire rootfs, so an
  attacker can edit the\nfilesystem and gain control over the system.\n\nAs the default
  filesystem used by EVE OS is squashfs, this is somewhat harder than an ext4,\nwhich
  is easily changeable.\n\nThis will not stop an attacker, as an attacker can repackage
  the squashfs with their changes\nin it and replace the partition altogether.\n\nThis
  can also be done directly on the device, as the “003-storage-init” container contains
  the\n“mksquashfs” and “unsquashfs” binaries (with the corresponding libs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn
  attacker can gain full control over the device without changing the PCR values,
  thus not\ntriggering the “measured boot” mechanism, and having full access to the
  vault.\n\n\n\nNote:\n\nThis issue was partially fixed in these commits (after disclosure
  to Zededa), where the config\npartition measurement was added to PCR13:\n\n• aa3501d6c57206ced222c33aea15a9169d629141\n\n•
  5fef4d92e75838cc78010edaed5247dfbdae1889.\n\nThis issue was made viable in version
  9.0.0 when the calculation was moved to PCR14 but it was not included in the measured
  boot."
