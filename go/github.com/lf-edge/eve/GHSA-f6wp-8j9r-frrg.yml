title: "Duplicate Advisory: EVE: SSH as Root Unlockable Without Triggering Measured
  Boot"
description: "### Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it
  is a duplicate of GHSA-phcg-h58r-gmcq. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n### Original Description\nOn boot, the Pillar eve container checks
  for the existence and content of\n“/config/authorized_keys”.\n\nIf the file is present,
  and contains a supported public key, the container will go on to open\nport 22 and
  enable sshd with the given keys as the authorized keys for root login.\n\nAn attacker
  could easily add their own keys and gain full control over the system without\ntriggering
  the “measured boot” mechanism implemented by EVE OS, and without marking\nthe device
  as “UUD” (“Unknown Update Detected”).\n\nThis is because the “/config” partition
  is not protected by “measured boot”, it is mutable, and\nit is not encrypted in
  any way.\n\n\n\n\nAn attacker can gain full control over the device without changing
  the PCR values, thus not\ntriggering the “measured boot” mechanism, and having full
  access to the vault.\n\n\n\nNote:\n\nThis issue was partially fixed in these commits
  (after disclosure to Zededa), where the config\npartition measurement was added
  to PCR13:\n\n• aa3501d6c57206ced222c33aea15a9169d629141\n\n• 5fef4d92e75838cc78010edaed5247dfbdae1889.\n\nThis
  issue was made viable in version 9.0.0 when the calculation was moved to PCR14 but
  it was not included in the measured boot."
