title: "EVE Freely Allocates Buffer on The Stack With Data From Socket"
description: "VTPM server listens on port 8877, exposing limited TPM functionality.
  The server reads 4 bytes as a uint32 size header, then allocates that amount on
  the stack for incoming data. This allows Denial of Service attacks against the vTPM
  service.\n\nAn workload (a container or VM) running on EVE-OS can use this to generate
  a DOS against the vTPM service."
