package_slug: "go/github.com/lf-edge/eve"
title: "EVE Has Partially Predetermined Vault Key"
description: "The deriveVaultKey function calls retrieveCloudKey which always returns
  \"foobarfoobarfoobarfoobarfoobarfo\". When merged with the randomly generated 32-byte
  key using mergeKeys (16 bytes from each), the last 16 bytes are always \"arfoobarfoobarfo\".
  This enables an attacker with physical access to the EVE-OS device to attempt to
  brute force the remaining 128 bits of key."
