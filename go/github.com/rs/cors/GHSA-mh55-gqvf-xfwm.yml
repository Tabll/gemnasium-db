title: "Denial of service via malicious preflight requests in github.com/rs/cors"
description: "Middleware causes a prohibitive amount of heap allocations when processing
  malicious preflight requests that include a Access-Control-Request-Headers (ACRH)
  header whose value contains many commas. This behavior can be abused by attackers
  to produce undue load on the middleware/server as an attempt to cause a denial of
  service."
