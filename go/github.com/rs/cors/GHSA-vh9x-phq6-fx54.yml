title: "Duplicate Advisory: Denial of service via malicious preflight requests in
  github.com/rs/cors"
description: "### Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it
  is a duplicate of GHSA-mh55-gqvf-xfwm. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n### Original Description\nMiddleware causes a prohibitive amount
  of heap allocations when processing malicious preflight requests that include a
  Access-Control-Request-Headers (ACRH) header whose value contains many commas. This
  behavior can be abused by attackers to produce undue load on the middleware/server
  as an attempt to cause a denial of service."
