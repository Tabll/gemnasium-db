title: "The Bare Metal Operator (BMO) can expose particularly named secrets from other
  namespaces via BMH CRD"
description: "The Bare Metal Operator (BMO) implements a Kubernetes API for managing
  bare metal hosts in Metal3. The `BareMetalHost` (BMH) CRD allows the `userData`,
  `metaData`, and `networkData` for the provisioned host to be specified as links
  to Kubernetes Secrets. There are fields for both the `Name` and `Namespace` of the
  Secret, meaning that the baremetal-operator will read a `Secret` from any namespace.
  A user with access to create or edit a `BareMetalHost` can thus exfiltrate a `Secret`
  from another namespace by using it as e.g. the `userData` for provisioning some
  host (note that this need not be a real host, it could be a VM somewhere)."
