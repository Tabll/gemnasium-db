title: "Git credentials are exposed in Atlantis logs"
description: "_Short summary of the problem. Make the impact and severity as clear
  as possible. For example: An unsafe deserialization vulnerability allows any unauthenticated
  user to execute arbitrary code on the server._\n\nAtlantis logs contains GitHub
  credentials (tokens `ghs_...`) when they are rotated. This enables an attacker able
  to read these logs to impersonate Atlantis application and to perform actions on
  GitHub.\n\nWhen Atlantis is used to administer a GitHub organization, this enables
  getting administration privileges on the organization.\n\nThis was reported in https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/4060
  and fixed in https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/pull/4667 . The fix was included
  in [Atlantis v0.30.0](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/tag/v0.30.0)."
