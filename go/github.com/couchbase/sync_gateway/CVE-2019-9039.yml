identifier: "CVE-2019-9039"
package_slug: "go/github.com/couchbase/sync_gateway"
title: "SQL Injection"
description: "In Couchbase Sync Gateway, an attacker with access to the Sync Gateway's
  public REST API was able to issue additional N1QL statements and extract sensitive
  data or call arbitrary N1QL functions through the parameters `startkey` and `endkey`
  on the `_all_docs` endpoint. By issuing nested queries with CPU-intensive operations
  they may have been able to cause increased resource usage and denial of service
  conditions. The `_all_docs` endpoint is not required for Couchbase Mobile replication
  and external access to this REST endpoint has been blocked to mitigate this issue."
