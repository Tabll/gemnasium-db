title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')"
description: "In Couchbase Sync Gateway 2.1.2, an attacker with access to the Sync
  Gatewayâ€™s public REST API was able to issue additional N1QL statements and extract
  sensitive data or call arbitrary N1QL functions through the parameters \"startkey\"
  and \"endkey\" on the \"_all_docs\" endpoint. By issuing nested queries with CPU-intensive
  operations they may have been able to cause increased resource usage and denial
  of service conditions. The _all_docs endpoint is not required for Couchbase Mobile
  replication and external access to this REST endpoint has been blocked to mitigate
  this issue. This issue has been fixed in versions 2.5.0 and 2.1.3."
