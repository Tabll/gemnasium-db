title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "Dapr is a portable, event-driven, runtime for building distributed applications
  across cloud and edge. A vulnerability has been found in Dapr that allows bypassing
  API token authentication, which is used by the Dapr sidecar to authenticate calls
  coming from the application, with a well-crafted HTTP request. Users who leverage
  API token authentication are encouraged to upgrade Dapr to 1.10.9 or to 1.11.2.
  This vulnerability impacts Dapr users who have configured API token authentication.
  An attacker could craft a request that is always allowed by the Dapr sidecar over
  HTTP, even if the `dapr-api-token` in the request is invalid or missing. The issue
  has been fixed in Dapr 1.10.9 or to 1.11.2. There are no known workarounds for this
  vulnerability.\n"
