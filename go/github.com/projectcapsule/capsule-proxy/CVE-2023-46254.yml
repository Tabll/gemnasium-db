package_slug: "go/github.com/projectcapsule/capsule-proxy"
title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "capsule-proxy is a reverse proxy for Capsule kubernetes multi-tenancy
  framework. A bug in the RoleBinding reflector used by `capsule-proxy` gives ServiceAccount
  tenant owners the right to list Namespaces of other tenants backed by the same owner
  kind and name. For example consider two tenants `solar` and `wind`. Tenant `solar`,
  owned by a ServiceAccount named `tenant-owner` in the Namespace `solar`. Tenant
  `wind`, owned by a ServiceAccount named `tenant-owner` in the Namespace `wind`.
  The Tenant owner `solar` would be able to list the namespaces of the Tenant `wind`
  and vice-versa, although this is not correct. The bug introduces an exfiltration
  vulnerability since allows the listing of Namespace resources of other Tenants,
  although just in some specific conditions: 1. `capsule-proxy` runs with the `--disable-caching=false`
  (default value: `false`) and 2. Tenant owners are ServiceAccount, with the same
  resource name, but in different Namespaces. This vulnerability does not allow any
  privilege escalation on the outer tenant Namespace-scoped resources, since the Kubernetes
  RBAC is enforcing this. This issue has been addressed in version 0.4.5. Users are
  advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
