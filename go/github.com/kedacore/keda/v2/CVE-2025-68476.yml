title: "KEDA has Arbitrary File Read via Insufficient Path Validation in HashiCorp
  Vault Service Account Credential"
description: "An Arbitrary File Read vulnerability has been identified in KEDA, potentially
  affecting any KEDA resource that uses TriggerAuthentication to configure HashiCorp
  Vault authentication.\n\nThe vulnerability stems from an incorrect or insufficient
  path validation when loading the Service Account Token specified in spec.hashiCorpVault.credential.serviceAccount.\n\nAn
  attacker with permissions to create or modify a TriggerAuthentication resource can
  exfiltrate the content of any file from the node's filesystem (where the KEDA pod
  resides) by directing the file's content to a server under their control, as part
  of the Vault authentication request.\n\nThe potential impact includes the exfiltration
  of sensitive system information, such as secrets, keys, or the content of files
  like /etc/passwd."
