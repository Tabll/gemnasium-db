title: "Possible ORM Leak Vulnerability in the Harbor"
description: "Administrator users on Harbor could exploit an ORM Leak (https://www.elttam.com/blog/plormbing-your-django-orm/)
  vulnerability that was present in the `/api/v2.0/users` endpoint to leak users'
  password hash and salt values. This vulnerability was introduced into the application
  because the `q` URL parameter allowed the administrator to filter users by any column,
  and the filter `password=~` could be abused to leak out a user's password hash character
  by character.\n\nAn attacker with administrator access could exploit this vulnerability
  to leak highly sensitive information stored on the Harbor database, as demonstrated
  in the attached writeup by the leaking of users' password hashes and salts. All
  endpoints that support the `q` URL parameter are vulnerable to this ORM leak attack,
  and could potentially be exploitable by lower privileged users to gain unauthorised
  access to other sensitive information."
