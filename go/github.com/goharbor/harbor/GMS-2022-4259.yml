title: "Improper Access Control"
description: "### Impact\nHarbor fails to validate the user permissions when updating
  tag immutability policies - API call:\n\n PUT /projects/{project_name_or_id}/immutabletagrules/{immutable_rule_id}\n\nBy
  sending a request to update a tag immutability policy with an id that belongs to
  a\nproject that the currently authenticated user doesnâ€™t have access to, the attacker
  could\nmodify tag immutability policies configured in other projects.\n\n### Patches\nThis
  and similar issues are fixed in Harbor v2.5.2 and later. Please upgrade as soon
  as possible.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere are no workarounds available.\n\n### For
  more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n*
  Open an issue in [the Harbor GitHub repository](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor)\n\n###
