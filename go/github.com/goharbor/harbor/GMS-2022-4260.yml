package_slug: "go/github.com/goharbor/harbor"
title: "Improper Access Control"
description: "### Impact\nHarbor fails to validate the user permissions to view Webhook
  policies including relevant credentials configured in different projects the user
  doesn’t have access to, resulting in malicious users being able to read Webhook
  policies of other users/projects. API call is\n\n  GET /projects/{project_name_or_id}/webhook/policies/{webhook_policy_id}\n\nBy
  sending the below request and specifying different Webhook policy ids in the last
  part of the URL, the malicious user may disclose Webhook policies related to other
  repositories/projects.: none;\">\n\n### Patches\nThis and similar issues are fixed
  in Harbor v2.5.2 and later. Please upgrade as soon as possible.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere
  are no workarounds available.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions
  or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [the Harbor GitHub repository](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor)\n\n###
