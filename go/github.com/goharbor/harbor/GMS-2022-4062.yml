title: "Harbor fails to validate the user permissions when reading job execution logs
  through the P2P preheat execution logs"
description: "Harbor fails to validate the user permissions when reading job 
  execution logs through the P2P preheat execution logs - API call

  By sending a request that attempts to read P2P preheat execution logs and 
  specifying different job ids, malicious authenticatedusers could read all
