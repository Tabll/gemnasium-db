title: "Blst vulnerable to incorrect results for some inputs in blst_fp_eucl_inverse
  function"
description: "During the course of differential fuzzing of the blst library by @guidovranken
  it was discovered that blst would produce the incorrect result for some input values
  in the inverse function. This was the result of the introduction of a new inversion
  formula in version v0.3.0. This source of these incorrect outputs was due to two
  issues:\n\n1. The amount of inner loop iterations was not sufficient for the algorithm
  to converge.\n2. It was erroneously assumed that the absolute value of the intermediate
  result would be capped at 767-bits. As a result, some output values were truncated
  by one bit or the most significant bit was misinterpreted as the sign."
