title: "A potential risk in clusternet which can be leveraged to make a cluster-level
  privilege escalation"
description: "## Summary:\nA potential risk in clusternet which can be leveraged to
  make a cluster-level privilege escalation.\n## Detailed analysis:\nThe clusternet
  has a deployment called cluster-hub inside the clusternet-system Kubernetes namespace,
  which runs on worker nodes\nrandomly. The deployment has a service account called
  clusternet-hub, which has a cluster role called clusternet:hub via cluster role
  binding. The clusternet:hub cluster role has \"*\" verbs of \"*.*\" resources. Thus,
  if a malicious user can access the worker node which runs the clusternet, he/she
  can leverage the service account to do malicious actions to critical system resources.
  For example, he/she can leverage the service account to get ALL secrets in the entire
  cluster, resulting in cluster-level privilege escalation."
