package_slug: "go/github.com/zitadel/zitadel"
title: "ZITADEL Account Takeover via Malicious Host Header Injection"
description: "### Impact\n\nZITADEL uses the notification triggering requests Forwarded
  or X-Forwarded-Host header to build the button link sent in emails for confirming
  a password reset with the emailed code. If this header is overwritten and a user
  clicks the link to a malicious site in the email, the secret code can be retrieved
  and used to reset the users password and take over his account.\n\nAccounts with
  MFA or Passwordless enabled can not be taken over by this attack.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe
  patched ZITADEL versions verify, that the auth requests instance is retrieved by
  the requests original domain (from the Forwarded or X-Forwarded-Host headers if
  available). If the instance can't be found using the original host or the auth request
  can't be found within that instance, ZITADEL throws an error.\n\n2.x versions are
  fixed on >= [2.41.6](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.41.6)\n2.40.x
  versions are fixed on >= [2.40.10](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.40.10)\n2.39.x
  versions are fixed on >= [2.39.9](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.39.9)\n\nThe
  vulnerablility was introduced with 2.39.0.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nA ZITADEL fronting
  proxy can be configured to delete all Forwarded and X-Forwarded-Host header values
  before sending requests to ZITADEL self-hosted environments.\n\n### References\n\nNone\n\n###
