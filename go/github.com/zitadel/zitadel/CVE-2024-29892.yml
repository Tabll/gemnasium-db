title: "ZITADEL's actions can overload reserved claims"
description: "Under certain circumstances an action could set [reserved claims](https://zitadel.com/docs/apis/openidoauth/claims#reserved-claims)
  managed by ZITADEL.\n\nFor example it would be possible to set the claim `urn:zitadel:iam:user:resourceowner:name`\n\n```json\n{\"urn:zitadel:iam:user:resourceowner:name\":
  \"ACME\"}\n```\n\nif it was not set by ZITADEL itself.\n\nTo compensate for this
  we introduced a protection that does prevent actions from changing claims that start
  with `urn:zitadel:iam`"
