title: "Account Takeover via Session Fixation in Zitadel [Bypassing MFA]"
description: "ZITADEL uses a cookie to identify the user agent (browser) and its user
  sessions.\n\nAlthough the cookie was handled according to best practices, it was
  accessible on subdomains of the ZITADEL instance. An attacker could take advantage
  of this and provide a malicious link hosted on the subdomain to the user to gain
  access to the victimâ€™s account in certain scenarios.\nA possible victim would need
  to login through the malicious link for this exploit to work.\n\nIf the possible
  victim already had the cookie present, the attack would not succeed. The attack
  would further only be possible if there was an initial vulnerability on the subdomain.
  This could either be the attacker being able to control DNS or a XSS vulnerability
  in an application hosted on a subdomain."
