title: "Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password"
description: "ZITADEL provides identity infrastructure. In versions 2.37.2 and prior,
  ZITADEL administrators can enable a setting called \"Ignoring unknown usernames\"
  which helps mitigate attacks that try to guess/enumerate usernames. While this settings
  was properly working during the authentication process it does not work correctly
  on the password reset flow. This meant that even if this feature was active that
  an attacker could use the password reset function to verify if an account exist
  within ZITADEL. This bug has been patched in versions 2.37.3 and 2.38.0. No known
  workarounds are available."
