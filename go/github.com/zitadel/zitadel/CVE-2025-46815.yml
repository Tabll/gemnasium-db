title: "ZITADEL Allows IdP Intent Token Reuse"
description: "ZITADEL offers developers the ability to manage user sessions using
  the [Session API](https://zitadel.com/docs/category/apis/resources/session_service_v2/session-service).
  This API enables the use of IdPs for authentication, known as idp intents.\n\nFollowing
  a successful idp intent, the client receives an id and token on a predefined URI.
  These id and token can then be used to authenticate the user or their session.\n\nHowever,
  it was possible to exploit this feature by repeatedly using intents. This allowed
  an attacker with access to the application’s URI to retrieve the id and token, enabling
  them to authenticate on behalf of the user.\n\nIt’s important to note that the use
  of additional factors (MFA) prevents a complete authentication process and, consequently,
  access to the ZITADEL API."
