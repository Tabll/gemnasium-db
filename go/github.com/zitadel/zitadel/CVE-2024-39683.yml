title: "ZITADEL Vulnerable to Session Information Leakage"
description: "ZITADEL provides users the ability to list all user sessions of the
  current user agent (browser) by API and in the Console UI.\n\nDue to a missing check,
  user sessions without that information (e.g. when created though the session service)
  were incorrectly listed exposing potentially other user's sessions.\n\nNote that
  the Login UI was never affected and there was no possibility to take over such a
  session."
