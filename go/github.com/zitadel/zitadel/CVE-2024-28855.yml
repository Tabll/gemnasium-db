title: "Improper HTML sanitization in ZITADEL"
description: "ZITADEL uses Go templates to render the login UI.\n\nDue to a improper
  use of the `text/template` instead of the `html/template` package, the Login UI
  did not sanitize input parameters. An attacker could create a malicious link, where
  he injected code which would be rendered as part of the login screen.\nWhile it
  was possible to inject HTML including javascript, the execution of such scripts
  would be prevented by the Content Security Policy."
