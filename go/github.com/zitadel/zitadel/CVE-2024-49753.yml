title: "Denied Host Validation Bypass in Zitadel Actions"
description: "A flaw in the URL validation mechanism of Zitadel actions allows bypassing
  restrictions intended to block requests to localhost (127.0.0.1).  The isHostBlocked
  check, designed to prevent such requests, can be circumvented by creating a DNS
  record that resolves to 127.0.0.1. This enables actions to send requests to localhost
  despite the intended security measures."
