package_slug: "go/github.com/b3log/wide"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream
  Component ('Injection')"
description: "b3log Wide before 1.6.0 allows three types of attacks to access arbitrary
  files. First, the attacker can write code in the editor, and compile and run it
  approximately three times to read an arbitrary file. Second, the attacker can create
  a symlink, and then place the symlink into a ZIP archive. An unzip operation leads
  to read access, and write access (depending on file permissions), to the symlink
  target. Third, the attacker can import a Git repository that contains a symlink,
  similarly leading to read and write access."
