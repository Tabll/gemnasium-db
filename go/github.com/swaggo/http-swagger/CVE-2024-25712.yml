description: "http-swagger before 1.2.6 allows XSS via PUT requests, because a file
  that has been uploaded (via httpSwagger.WrapHandler and *webdav.memFile) can subsequently
  be accessed via a GET request. NOTE: this is independently fixable with respect
  to CVE-2022-24863, because (if a solution continued to allow PUT requests) large
  files could have been blocked without blocking JavaScript, or JavaScript could have
  been blocked without blocking large files."
