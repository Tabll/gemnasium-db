title: "Improper Privilege Management"
description: "A privilege escalation flaw was found in Podman. This flaw allows an
  attacker to publish a malicious image to a public registry. Once this image is downloaded
  by a potential victim, the vulnerability is triggered after a user runs the 'podman
  top' command. This action gives the attacker access to the host filesystem, leading
  to information disclosure or denial of service."
