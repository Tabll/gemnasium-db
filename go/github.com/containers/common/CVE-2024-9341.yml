- "GHSA-mc76-5925-c5p6"
package_slug: "go/github.com/containers/common"
title: "Link Following in github.com/containers/common"
description: "A flaw was found in Go. When FIPS mode is enabled on a system, container
  runtimes may incorrectly handle certain file paths due to improper validation in
  the containers/common Go library. This flaw allows an attacker to exploit symbolic
  links and trick the system into mounting sensitive host directories inside a container.
  This issue also allows attackers to access critical host files, bypassing the intended
  isolation between containers and the host system."
