title: "Buildah allows build breakout using malicious Containerfiles and concurrent
  builds"
description: "With careful use of the `--mount` flag in RUN instructions in Containerfiles,
  and by using either multi-stage builds with use of concurrently-executing build
  stages (e.g., using the `--jobs` CLI flag) or multiple separate but concurrently-executing
  builds, a malicious Containerfile can be used to expose content from the build host
  to the command being run using the RUN instruction.  This can be used to read or
  write contents using the privileges of the process which is performing the build.
  \ When that process is a root-owned podman system service which is provided for
  use by unprivileged users, this includes the ability to read and write contents
  which the client should not be allowed to read and write, including setuid executables
  in locations where they can be later accessed by unprivileged users."
