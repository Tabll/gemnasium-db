title: "Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')"
description: "An issue was discovered in Podman in libpod before 1.6.0. It resolves
  a symlink in the host context during a copy operation from the container to the
  host, because an undesired glob operation occurs. An attacker could create a container
  image containing particular symlinks that, when copied by a victim user to the host
  filesystem, may overwrite existing files with others from the host."
