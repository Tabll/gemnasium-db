title: "Information disclosure in podman"
description: "An information disclosure vulnerability was found in containers/podman
  in versions before 2.0.5. When using the deprecated Varlink API or the Docker-compatible
  REST API, if multiple containers are created in a short duration, the environment
  variables from the first container will get leaked into subsequent containers. An
  attacker who has control over the subsequent containers could use this flaw to gain
  access to sensitive information stored in such variables."
