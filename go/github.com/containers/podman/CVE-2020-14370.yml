description: "An information disclosure vulnerability was found in `containers/podman`
  When using the deprecated Varlink API or the Docker-compatible REST API, if multiple
  containers are created in a short duration, the environment variables from the first
  container will get leaked into subsequent containers. An attacker who has control
  over the subsequent containers could use this flaw to gain access to sensitive information
  stored in such variables."
