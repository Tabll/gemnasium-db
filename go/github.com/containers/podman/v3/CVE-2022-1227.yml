title: "Podman publishes a malicious image to public registries"
description: "Podman is a tool for managing OCI containers and pods. A privilege escalation
  flaw was found in Podman. This flaw allows an attacker to publish a malicious image
  to a public registry. Once this image is downloaded by a potential victim, the vulnerability
  is triggered after a user runs the 'podman top' command. This action gives the attacker
  access to the host filesystem, leading to information disclosure or denial of service."
