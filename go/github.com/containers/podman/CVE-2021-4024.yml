package_slug: "go/github.com/containers/podman"
title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "A flaw was found in podman. The `podman machine` function (used to create
  and manage Podman virtual machine containing a Podman process) spawns a `gvproxy`
  process on the host system. The `gvproxy` API is accessible on port on all IP addresses
  on the host. If that port is open on the host's firewall, an attacker can potentially
  use the `gvproxy` API to forward ports on the host to ports in the VM, making private
  services on the VM accessible to the network. This issue could be also used to interrupt
  the host's services by forwarding all ports to the VM."
