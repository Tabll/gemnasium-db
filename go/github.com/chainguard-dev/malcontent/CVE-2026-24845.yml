title: "malcontent OCI image pull credential exfiltration via malicious registry token
  realm"
description: "Malcontent could be made to expose Docker registry credentials if it
  scanned a specially crafted OCI image reference. Malcontent uses [google/go-containerregistry](https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry)
  for OCI image pulls, which by default uses the Docker credential keychain. A malicious
  registry could return a `WWW-Authenticate` header redirecting token authentication
  to an attacker-controlled endpoint, causing credentials to be sent to that endpoint.\n\n**Fix:**
  [Default to anonymous auth for OCI pulls](https://github.com/chainguard-dev/malcontent/commit/538ed00cdc639d687a4bd1e843a2be0428a3b3e7)\n\n**Acknowledgements**\n\nThank
  you to Oleh Konko from [1seal](https://1seal.org/) for discovering and reporting
  this issue."
