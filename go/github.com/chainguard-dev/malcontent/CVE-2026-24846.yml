title: "malcontent vulnerable to symlink Path Traversal via handleSymlink argument
  confusion in archive extraction"
description: "malcontent could be made to create symlinks outside the intended extraction
  directory when scanning a specially crafted tar or deb archive. The `handleSymlink`
  function received arguments in the wrong order, causing the symlink target to be
  used as the symlink location. Additionally, symlink targets were not validated to
  ensure they resolved within the extraction directory."
