title: "Possible privilege escalation via bash completion script"
description: "The bash completion script for `fscrypt` through v0.3.2 allows injection
  of commands via crafted mountpoint paths, allowing privilege escalation under a
  specific set of circumstances. A local user who has control over mountpoint paths
  could potentially escalate their privileges if they create a malicious mountpoint
  path and if the system administrator happens to be using the `fscrypt` bash completion
  script to complete mountpoint paths. We recommend upgrading to v0.3.3 or above.\n\nFor
  more details, see [CVE-2022-25328](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-25328)."
