title: "Possible filesystem space exhaustion by local users"
description: "`fscrypt` through v0.3.2 creates a world-writable directory by default
  when setting up a filesystem, allowing unprivileged users to exhaust filesystem
  space. We recommend upgrading to `fscrypt` v0.3.3 or above and adjusting the permissions
  on existing `fscrypt` metadata directories where applicable.\n\nFor more details,
