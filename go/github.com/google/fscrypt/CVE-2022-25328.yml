package_slug: "go/github.com/google/fscrypt"
title: "Command injection in github.com/google/fscrypt"
description: "The bash_completion script for fscrypt allows injection of commands
  via crafted mountpoint paths, allowing privilege escalation under a specific set
  of circumstances. A local user who has control over mountpoint paths could potentially
  escalate their privileges if they create a malicious mountpoint path and if the
  system administrator happens to be using the fscrypt bash completion script to complete
  mountpoint paths. We recommend upgrading to version 0.3.3 or above"
