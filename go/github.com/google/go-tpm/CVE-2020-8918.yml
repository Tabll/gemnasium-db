identifier: "CVE-2020-8918"
package_slug: "go/github.com/google/go-tpm"
title: "Improper Initialization"
description: "An improperly initialized `migrationAuth' value in Google's go-tpm library
  can lead an eavesdropping attacker to discover the `auth` value for a key created
  with CreateWrapKey. An attacker listening in on the channel can collect both `encUsageAuth`
  and `encMigrationAuth`, and then can calculate `usageAuth ^ encMigrationAuth` as
  the `migrationAuth` can be guessed for all keys created with `CreateWrapKey`."
