title: "Incorrect Default Permissions"
description: "A privilege escalation vulnerability impacting the Google Exposure Notification
  Verification Server (versions prior to 0.23.1), allows an attacker who (1) has UserWrite
  permissions and (2) is using a carefully crafted request or malicious proxy, to
  create another user with higher privileges than their own. This occurs due to insufficient
  checks on the allowed set of permissions. The new user creation event would be captured
  in the Event Log."
