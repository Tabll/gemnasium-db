title: "Import of incorrectly embargoed keys could cause early publication"
description: "### Impact\n\nIf your installation is using the `export-importer` service,
  there is potential impact.\nIf your installation is not importing keys via the `export-importer`
  services, your installation is not impacted.\n\nIn versions `0.19.1` and earlier,
  the `export-importer` service assumed that the server it was importing from had
  properly embargoed keys for at least 2 hours after their expiry time. There are
  now known instances of servers that did not properly embargo keys.\n\nThis could
  allow allow for imported keys to be re-published before they have expired, allowing
  for potential replay of RPIs.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis is patched in `v0.18.3` and
  all versions `0.19.2` and later.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nEnsure that the servers you
  are importing export zip files from are not publishing keys too early. \n\n### References\n\nn/a\n\n###
