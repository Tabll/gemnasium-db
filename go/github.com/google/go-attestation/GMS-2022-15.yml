package_slug: "go/github.com/google/go-attestation"
title: "Improper Input Validation in AKPublic.Verify with attacker-controlled TPM
  Quote"
description: "An improper input validation vulnerability in go-attestation
  allows local users to provide a maliciously-formed Quote over no/some PCRs, causing
  `AKPublic.Verify` to succeed despite the inconsistency. Subsequent use of the same
  set of PCR values in `Eventlog.Verify` lacks the authentication performed by quote
  verification, meaning a local attacker could couple this vulnerability with a maliciously-crafted
  TCG log in `Eventlog.Verify` to spoof events in the TCG log, hence defeating remotely-attested
  measured-boot."
