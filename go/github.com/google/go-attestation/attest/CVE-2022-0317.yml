package_slug: "go/github.com/google/go-attestation/attest"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "An improper input validation vulnerability in go-attestation before
  0.3.3 allows local users to provide a maliciously-formed Quote over no/some PCRs,
  causing AKPublic.Verify to succeed despite the inconsistency. Subsequent use of
  the same set of PCR values in Eventlog.Verify lacks the authentication performed
  by quote verification, meaning a local attacker could couple this vulnerability
  with a maliciously-crafted TCG log in Eventlog.Verify to spoof events in the TCG
  log, hence defeating remotely-attested measured-boot. We recommend upgrading to
  Version 0.4.0 or above."
