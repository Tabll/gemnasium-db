title: "Potential Vulnerabilities Due to Outdated golang.org/x/crypto Dependency in
  NanoProxy"
description: "A security issue was identified in the NanoProxy project related to
  the `golang.org/x/crypto` dependency. The project was using an outdated version
  of this dependency, which potentially exposed the system to security vulnerabilities
  that have been addressed in subsequent updates.\n\nImpact:\nThe specific vulnerabilities
  in the outdated version of `golang.org/x/crypto` could include authorization bypasses,
  data breaches, or other security risks. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by
  attackers to compromise the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of the system.\n\nResolution:\nThe
  issue has been fixed in NanoProxy by upgrading the `golang.org/x/crypto` dependency
  to version 0.31.0. Users are strongly encouraged to update their instances of NanoProxy
  to include this fix and ensure they are using the latest secure version of all dependencies.\n\nFixed
  Version:\n* `golang.org/x/crypto` upgraded to version 0.31.0."
