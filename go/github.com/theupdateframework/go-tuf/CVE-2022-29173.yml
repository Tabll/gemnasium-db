title: "Improper Validation of Integrity Check Value"
description: "go-tuf is a Go implementation of The Update Framework (TUF). go-tuf
  does not correctly implement the client workflow for updating the metadata files
  for roles other than the root role. Specifically, checks for rollback attacks are
  not implemented correctly meaning an attacker can cause clients to install software
  that is older than the software which the client previously knew to be available,
  and may include software with known vulnerabilities. In more detail, the client
  code of go-tuf has several issues in regards to preventing rollback attacks: 1.
  It does not take into account the content of any previously trusted metadata, if
  available, before proceeding with updating roles other than the root role (i.e.,
  steps 5.4.3.1 and 5.5.5 of the detailed client workflow). This means that any form
  of version verification done on the newly-downloaded metadata is made using the
  default value of zero, which always passes. 2. For both timestamp and snapshot roles,
  go-tuf saves these metadata files as trusted before verifying if the version of
  the metafiles they refer to is correct (i.e., steps 5.5.4 and 5.6.4 of the detailed
  client workflow). A fix is available in version 0.3.0 or newer. No workarounds are
  known for this issue apart from upgrading."
