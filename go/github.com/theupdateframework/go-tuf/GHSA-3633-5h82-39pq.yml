title: "Go-tuf Improperly handles multiple key IDs for the same public keys in attacker-controlled
  metadata"

  either attackers or the repository (deliberately or mistakenly respectively) to
  have produced such an incorrect distribution of public keys, causing clients < 0.3.2
  to fall prey to this issue."
