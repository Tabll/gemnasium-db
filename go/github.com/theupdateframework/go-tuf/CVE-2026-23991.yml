title: "go-tuf affected by client DoS via malformed server response"
description: "If the TUF repository (or any of its mirrors) returns invalid TUF metadata
  JSON (valid JSON but not well formed TUF metadata), the client will panic _during
  parsing_, causing a DoS. The panic happens before any signature is validated. This
  means that a compromised repository/mirror/cache can DoS clients without having
  access to any signing key."
