title: "Grafana vulnerable to authorization bypass"
description: "It is possible for a user in a different organization from the owner
  of a snapshot to bypass authorization and delete a snapshot by issuing a `DELETE`
  request to `/api/snapshots/<key>` using its view key. This functionality is intended
  to only be available to individuals with the permission to write/edit to the snapshot
  in question, but due to a bug in the authorization logic, deletion requests issued
  by an unprivileged user in a different organization than the snapshot owner are
  treated as authorized.\n\nGrafana Labs would like to thank Ravid Mazon and Jay Chen
  of Palo Alto Research for discovering and disclosing this vulnerability.\n\nThis
  issue affects Grafana: from 9.5.0 before 9.5.18, from 10.0.0 before 10.0.13, from
  10.1.0 before 10.1.9, from 10.2.0 before 10.2.6, from 10.3.0 before 10.3.5."
