package_slug: "go/github.com/grafana/grafana"
title: "Grafana proxy Cross-site Scripting"
description: "On Jan. 16, an external security researcher, Jasu Viding contacted Grafana
  to disclose an XSS vulnerability in the way that Grafana handles data sources.\n\nAn
  attacker could serve HTML content through the Grafana datasource or plugin proxy
  and trick a user to visit this HTML page using a specially crafted link and execute
  a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attack. The attacker could either compromise an existing
  datasource for a specific Grafana instance or either set up its own public service
  and instruct anyone to set it up in their Grafana instance.\n\nWe believe that this
  vulnerability is rated at CVSS 6.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N)."
