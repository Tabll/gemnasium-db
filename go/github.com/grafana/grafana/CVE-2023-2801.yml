package_slug: "go/github.com/grafana/grafana"
title: "Improper Synchronization"
description: "Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability.
  \n\nUsing public dashboards users can query multiple distinct data sources using
  mixed queries. However such query has a possibility of crashing a Grafana instance.\n\nThe
  only feature that uses mixed queries at the moment is public dashboards, but it's
  also possible to cause this by calling the query API directly.\n\nThis might enable
  malicious users to crash Grafana instances through that endpoint.\n\nUsers may upgrade
  to version 9.4.12 and 9.5.3 to receive a fix.\n\n"
