title: "Duplicate Advisory: Grafana Improper Access Control vulnerability"
description: "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-cvm3-pp2j-chr3. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n## Original Description\nGrafana is an open-source platform for monitoring
  and observability. \n\nThe option to send a test alert is not available from the
  user panel UI for users having the Viewer role. It is still possible for a user
  with the Viewer role to send a test alert using the API as the API does not check
  access to this function.\n\nThis might enable malicious users to abuse the functionality
  by sending multiple alert messages to e-mail and Slack, spamming users, prepare
  Phishing attack or block SMTP server.\n\nUsers may upgrade to version 9.5.3, 9.4.12,
  9.3.15, 9.2.19 and 8.5.26 to receive a fix."
