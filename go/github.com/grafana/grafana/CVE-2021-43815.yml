  2021-12-09, GitHub Security Labs notified us of a vulnerability through which authenticated
  users could read out fully lowercase or fully uppercase `.md` files through directory
  traversal. Doing our own follow-up investigation we found a related vulnerability
  through which authenticated users could read out arbitrary `.csv` files through
  directory traversal. Thanks to our defense-in-depth approach, at no time has [Grafana
