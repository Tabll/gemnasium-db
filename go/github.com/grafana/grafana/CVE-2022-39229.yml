title: "Grafana when using email as a username can block other users from signing
  in"
description: "On September 7 as a result of an internal security audit we have discovered
  a security vulnerability in Grafana basic authentication, related to the usage of
  username and email address.\n\nIn Grafana, a user’s username and email address are
  unique fields, that means no other user can have the same username or email address
  as another user.\n\nIn addition, a user can have an email address as a username
  and Grafana login allows users to sign in with either username or email address.
  This creates an unusual behavior, where _user_1_ can register with one email address
  and _user_2_ can register their username as _user_1_’s email address. As a result,
  _user_1_ would be prevented to sign in Grafana, since _user_1_ password won’t match
  with _users_2_ email address.\n\nThe CVSS score for this vulnerability is 4.3 Moderate
  (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)."
