title: "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
description: "Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability.
  Affected versions are subject to a cross site request forgery vulnerability which
  allows attackers to elevate their privileges by mounting cross-origin attacks against
  authenticated high-privilege Grafana users (for example, Editors or Admins). An
  attacker can exploit this vulnerability for privilege escalation by tricking an
  authenticated user into inviting the attacker as a new user with high privileges.
  Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. There are no known workarounds
  for this issue."
