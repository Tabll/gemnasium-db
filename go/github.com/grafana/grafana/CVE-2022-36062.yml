package_slug: "go/github.com/grafana/grafana"
title: "Grafana folders admin only permission privilege escalation"
description: "On August 29 we have received a bug report for Grafana role-based access
  control (RBAC) and confirmed a vulnerability in the Grafana. This vulnerability
  impacts folders/dashboards with Admin only permissions and where RBAC was ever enabled
  at least once.\n\nWhen RBAC is enabled, Grafana runs migrations which translate
  legacy access control permissions into RBAC permissions. The migrations contain
  a bug, which grants additional access to folders/dashboards which only had Admin
  role grant, resulting in a privilege escalation where Editors can edit and Viewers
  can view the folder/dashboard which they should not have access to.\n\nThe CVSS
  score for this vulnerability is 6.4 Moderate (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L)."
