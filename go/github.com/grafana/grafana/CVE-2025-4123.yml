title: "Grafana Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) via custom loaded frontend plugin"
description: "A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Grafana caused
  by combining a client path traversal and open redirect. This allows attackers to
  redirect users to a website that hosts a frontend plugin that will execute arbitrary
  JavaScript. This vulnerability does not require editor permissions and if anonymous
  access is enabled, the XSS will work. If the Grafana Image Renderer plugin is installed,
  it is possible to exploit the open redirect to achieve a full read SSRF.\n\nThe
  default Content-Security-Policy (CSP) in Grafana will block the XSS though the `connect-src`
  directive."
