package_slug: "go/github.com/grafana/grafana"
title: "Grafana Command Injection And Local File Inclusion Via Sql Expressions"
description: "The SQL Expressions experimental feature of Grafana allows for the evaluation
  of `duckdb` queries containing user input. These queries are insufficiently sanitized
  before being passed to `duckdb`, leading to a command injection and local file inclusion
  vulnerability. Any user with the VIEWER or higher permission is capable of executing
  this attack.  The `duckdb` binary must be present in Grafana's $PATH for this attack
  to function; by default, this binary is not installed in Grafana distributions."
