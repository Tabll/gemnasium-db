title: "Authentication Token Exposure"
description: "The Synthetic Monitoring Agent for Grafana's Synthetic Monitoring application
  provides probe functionality and executes network checks for monitoring remote targets.
  Users running the Synthetic Monitoring agent prior to version 0.12.0 in their local
  network are impacted. The authentication token used to communicate with the Synthetic
  Monitoring API is exposed through a debugging endpoint. This token can be used to
  retrieve the Synthetic Monitoring checks created by the user and assigned to the
  agent identified with that token. The Synthetic Monitoring API will reject connections
  from already-connected agents, so access to the token does not guarantee access
  to the checks. Version 0.12.0 contains a fix. Users are advised to rotate the agent
  tokens. After upgrading to version v0.12.0 or later, it's recommended that users
  of distribution packages review the configuration stored in 
  `/etc/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-monitoring-agent.conf`,
  specifically the `API_TOKEN` variable which has been renamed to `SM_AGENT_API_TOKEN`.
  As a workaround for previous versions, it's recommended that users review the agent
  settings and set the HTTP listening address in a manner that limits the exposure,
  for example, localhost or a non-routed network, by using the command line parameter
  `-listen-address`, e.g. `-listen-address localhost:4050`."
