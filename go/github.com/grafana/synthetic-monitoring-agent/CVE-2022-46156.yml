package_slug: "go/github.com/grafana/synthetic-monitoring-agent"
title: "Default installation of `synthetic-monitoring-agent` exposes sensitive information"
description: "Users running the Synthetic Monitoring agent in their local network
  are impacted. The authentication token used to communicate with the Synthetic Monitoring
  API is exposed thru a debugging endpoint. This token can be used to retrieve the
  Synthetic Monitoring checks created by the user and assigned to the agent identified
  with that token. The Synthetic Monitoring API will reject connections from already-connected
  agents, so access to the token does not guarantee access to the checks."
