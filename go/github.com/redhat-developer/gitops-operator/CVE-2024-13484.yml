title: "OpenShift GitOps Operator Namespace Isolation Break"
description: "A flaw was found in openshift-gitops-operator-container. The openshift.io/cluster-monitoring
  label is applied to all namespaces that deploy an ArgoCD CR instance, allowing the
  namespace to create a rogue PrometheusRule. This issue can have adverse effects
  on the platform monitoring stack, as the rule is rolled out cluster-wide when the
  label is applied."
