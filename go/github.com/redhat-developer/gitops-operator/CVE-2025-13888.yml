title: "OpenShift GitOps authenticated attackers can obtain cluster root access through
  forged ArgoCD custom resources"
description: "A flaw was found in OpenShift GitOps. Namespace admins can create ArgoCD
  Custom Resources (CRs) that trick the system into granting them elevated permissions
  in other namespaces, including privileged namespaces. An authenticated attacker
  can then use these elevated permissions to create privileged workloads that run
  on master nodes, effectively giving them root access to the entire cluster."
