title: "Dagu affected by unauthenticated RCE via inline DAG spec in default configuration"
description: "Dagu's default configuration ships with authentication completely disabled.
  The `POST /api/v2/dag-runs` endpoint accepts an inline YAML spec and executes its
  shell commands immediately — no credentials, no token, nothing. Any dagu instance
  reachable over the network is fully compromised by default. A second issue means
  that even with auth properly configured, operator-role users can still execute arbitrary
  commands by submitting inline specs through the same endpoint."
