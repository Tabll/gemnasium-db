package_slug: "go/github.com/dotmesh-io/dotmesh"
title: "dotmesh arbitrary file read and/or write"
description: "Dotmesh is a git-like command-line interface for capturing, organizing
  and sharing application states. In versions 0.8.1 and prior, the unsafe handling
  of symbolic links in an unpacking routine may enable attackers to read and/or write
  to arbitrary locations outside the designated target folder. The routine `untarFile`
  attempts to guard against creating symbolic links that point outside the directory
  a tar archive is extracted to. However, a malicious tarball first linking `subdir/parent`
  to `..` (allowed, because `subdir/..` falls within the archive root) and then linking
  `subdir/parent/escapes` to `..` results in a symbolic link pointing to the tarball’s
  parent directory, contrary to the routine’s goals. This issue may lead to arbitrary
  file write (with same permissions as the program running the unpack operation) if
  the attacker can control the archive file. Additionally, if the attacker has read
  access to the unpacked files, they may be able to read arbitrary system files the
  parent process has permissions to read. As of time of publication, no patch for
  this issue is available."
