package_slug: "go/github.com/bishopfox/sliver"
title: "Sliver has DNS C2 OTP Bypass that Allows Unauthenticated Session Flooding
  and Denial of Service"
description: "The DNS C2 listener accepts unauthenticated `TOTP` bootstrap messages
  and allocates server-side DNS sessions without validating OTP values, even when
  `EnforceOTP` is enabled. Because sessions are stored without a cleanup/expiry path
  in this flow, an unauthenticated remote actor can repeatedly create sessions and
  drive memory exhaustion."
