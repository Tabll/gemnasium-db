package_slug: "go/github.com/tendermint/tendermint"
title: "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature"
description: "TenderMint from version 0.33.0 and before version 0.33.6 allows block
  proposers to include signatures for the wrong block. This may happen naturally if
  you start a network, have it run for some time and restart it (**without changing
  chainID**). A malicious block proposer (even with a minimal amount of stake) can
  use this vulnerability to completely halt the network. This issue is fixed in Tendermint
  0.33.6 which checks all the signatures are for the block with 2/3+ majority before
  creating a commit."
