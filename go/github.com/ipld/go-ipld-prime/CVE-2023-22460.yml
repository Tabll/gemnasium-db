package_slug: "go/github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "go-ipld-prime is an implementation of the InterPlanetary Linked Data
  (IPLD) spec interfaces, a batteries-included codec implementations of IPLD for CBOR
  and JSON, and tooling for basic operations on IPLD objects. Encoding data which
  contains a Bytes kind Node will pass a Bytes token to the JSON encoder which will
  panic as it does not expect to receive Bytes tokens. Such an encode should be treated
  as an error, as plain JSON should not be able to encode Bytes. This only impacts
  uses of the `json` codec. `dag-json` is not impacted. Use of `json` as a decoder
  is not impacted. This issue is fixed in v0.19.0. As a workaround, one may prefer
  the `dag-json` codec, which has the ability to encode bytes."
