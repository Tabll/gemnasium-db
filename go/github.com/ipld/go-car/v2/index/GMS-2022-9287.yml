title: "Malformed CAR panics and excessive memory usage"
description: "Decoding CAR data from untrusted user input can cause, panics, out-of-bound
  memory access, out of memory, divide by zero, and excessive memory usage. Such panics
  can be triggered by intentionally malformed CARv1 data, including CARv1 data within
  a CARv2 container; and also CARv2 data with excessively large indexes. These vulnerabilities
  are not known to be exploited in the wild and were discovered primarily with the
  use of code fuzzing tooling."
