title: "Malformed CAR panics and excessive memory usage"
description: "Out of bound memory access (OOB), out of memory (OOM) panics or excessive
  memory usage can be triggered by decode of malformed CARv1 headers, malformed CARv1
  sections, and malformed CIDv0 data used in CARv1 sections. This also applies to
  CARv1 data within a CARv2 container. Additionally, we wish to use this security
  advisory to make clear to consumers of CARv2 format data that loading CARv2 indexes
  from untrusted sources is dangerous and should be avoided. Where CAR data indexes
  are required, they should be regenerated locally. Out of memory (OOM) panics or
  excessive memory usage can be triggered by decode of intentionally malformed CARv2
  indexes, or CARv2 indexes which are larger than available system memory (i.e. parallelization
  of CARv2 decodes may increase such a vulnerability)."
