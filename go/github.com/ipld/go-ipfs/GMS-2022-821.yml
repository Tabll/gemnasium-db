description: "### Impact\ngo-ipfs nodes with versions 0.10.0, 0.11.0, 0.12.0, or 0.12.1
  can crash when trying to traverse certain malformed graphs due to an issue in the
  go-codec-dagpb dependency. Vulnerable nodes that work with these malformed graphs
  may crash leading to denial-of-service risks.\n\nThis particularly impacts nodes
  that download or export data that is controlled by external user input as there
  is the possibility that a malicious user of those services could (intentionally
  or unintentionally) cause the node to traverse a malformed graph. Some notable use
  cases include public gateways and pinning services which fetch data on behalf of
  users, as well as applications such as IPFS Companion which load data based on a
  user visiting a website with links to IPFS URLs.\n\n### Patches\nVersions v0.11.1
  and v0.12.2 both resolve this issue. This should make it easy to upgrade, even if
  you have not yet performed the v0.12.0 migration.\n\nFor those running on forked
  versions of go-ipfs or who are on v0.10.0 and are having trouble with the v0.11.0
  breaking changes, simply updating the version of `go-codec-dagpb` you are using
  to >=v1.3.2 should resolve the issue.\n\nAny users of libraries within the go-ipfs
  ecosystem, even if not the go-ipfs package or binary itself, may be affected and
  should upgrade their dependency on go-codec-dagpb. You can check if your Go module
  has a dependency on `go-codec-dagpb` by running a command such as `go mod graph
  | grep go-codec-dagpb` in your module root.\n\n### Workarounds\nThe best way to
  workaround this issue is to control exposure to any endpoints that allow for arbitrary
  IPLD traversals. This primarily includes the HTTP RPC API (https://docs.ipfs.io/reference/http/api
  ) and the Gateway API. If you are exposing those APIs, then do so within an environment
  where only trusted users and applications you control have access to it. You should
  be safe as long as your users and applications do not create malformed graphs, which
  should not happen using standard `go-ipfs` tooling.\n\nIf you previously had a more
  open access environment, then closing off access will only be sufficient if both
  of the following are true:\n* The experimental GraphSync feature is disabled
  (https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/experimental-features.md#graphsync)
  \n* The only data being accessed is non-malformed data\n\n### References\nSee also the
