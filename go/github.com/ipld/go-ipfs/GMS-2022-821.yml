title: "Daemon panics when processing certain blocks"
description: "go-ipfs nodes with versions 0.10.0, 0.11.0, 0.12.0, or 0.12.1 can 
  crash when trying to traverse certain malformed graphs due to an issue in the 
  go-codec-dagpb dependency. Vulnerable nodes that work with these malformed graphs 
  may crash leading to denial-of-service risks.
  
  This particularly impacts nodes that download or export data that is controlled 
  by external user input as there is the possibility that a malicious user of those 
  services could (intentionally or unintentionally) cause the node to traverse a 
  malformed graph. Some notable use cases include public gateways and pinning 
  services which fetch data on behalf of users, as well as applications such as 
  IPFS Companion which load data based on a user visiting a website with links 
  to IPFS URLs."
