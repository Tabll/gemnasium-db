title: "Panic when processing certain blocks"
description: "### Impact\nDecoding certain blocks using the go-ipld-prime version
  of the dag-pb codec (go-codec-dagpb) can cause a panic. The panic comes from an
  assumption that the reported link length is accurate, but if the block ends before
  that reported length then itâ€™s a buffer overread.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue is fixed
  in v1.3.1 and above.\n\nConsumers can discover the versions of `go-codec-dagpb`
  in a module's dependency graph using the following command in the module root:\n\n```go
  mod graph | grep go-codec-dagpb```\n\n### Workarounds\nYou can work around this
  issue without upgrading by recovering panics higher in the call stack of the goroutine
  that calls the defective code.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions
  or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Ask in [IPFS Discord #ipld-chatter](https://discord.gg/ipfs)\n*
