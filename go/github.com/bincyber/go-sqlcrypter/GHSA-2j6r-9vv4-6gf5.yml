title: "github.com/bincyber/go-sqlcrypter vulnerable to IV collision"
description: "There is a risk of an IV collision using the awskms or aesgcm provider.
  NIST SP 800-38D section 8.3 states that it is unsafe to encrypt more than 2^32 plaintexts
  under the same key when using a random IV. The limit could easily be reached given
  the use case of database column encryption. Ciphertexts are likely to be persisted
  and stored together. IV collision could enable an attacker with access to the ciphertexts
  to decrypt all messages encrypted with the affected key.\n\nThe aesgcm provider
  cannot be fixed without a breaking change, so users should not encrypt more than
  2^32 values with any key. The awskms package can be fixed without a breaking change
  by switching to a counter-based IV."
