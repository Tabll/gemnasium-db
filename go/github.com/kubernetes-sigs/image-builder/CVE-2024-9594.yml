title: "VM images built with Image Builder with some providers use default credentials
  during builds in github.com/kubernetes-sigs/image-builder"
description: "A security issue was discovered in the Kubernetes Image Builder versions
  <= v0.1.37 where default credentials are enabled during the image build processÂ when
  using the Nutanix, OVA, QEMU or raw providers. The credentials can be used to gain
  root access. The credentials are disabled at the conclusion of the image build process.
  Kubernetes clusters are only affected if their nodes use VM images created via the
  Image Builder project. Because these images were vulnerable during the image build
  process, they are affected only if an attacker was able to reach the VM where the
  image build was happening and used the vulnerability to modify the image at the
  time the image build was occurring."
