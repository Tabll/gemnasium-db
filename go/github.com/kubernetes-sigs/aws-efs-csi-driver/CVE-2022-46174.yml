title: "Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race
  Condition')"
description: "efs-utils is a set of Utilities for Amazon Elastic File System (EFS).
  A potential race condition issue exists within the Amazon EFS mount helper in efs-utils
  versions v1.34.3 and below. When using TLS to mount file systems, the mount helper
  allocates a local port for stunnel to receive NFS connections prior to applying
  the TLS tunnel. In affected versions, concurrent mount operations can allocate the
  same local port, leading to either failed mount operations or an inappropriate mapping
  from an EFS customer’s local mount points to that customer’s EFS file systems. This
  issue is patched in version v1.34.4. There is no recommended work around. We recommend
  affected users update the installed version of efs-utils to v1.34.4 or later."
