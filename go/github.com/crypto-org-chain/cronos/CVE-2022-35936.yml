title: "Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere"
description: "Ethermint is an Ethereum library. In Ethermint running versions before
  `v0.17.2`, the contract `selfdestruct` invocation permanently removes the corresponding
  bytecode from the internal database storage. However, due to a bug in the `DeleteAccount`function,
  all contracts that used the identical bytecode (i.e shared the same `CodeHash`)
  will also stop working once one contract invokes `selfdestruct`, even though the
  other contracts does not invoke the `selfdestruct` OPCODE. This vulnerability has
  been patched in Ethermint version v0.18.0. The patch has state machine-breaking
  changes for applications using Ethermint, so a coordinated upgrade procedure is
  required. A workaround is available. If a contract is subject to DoS due to this
  issue, the user can redeploy the same contract, i.e. with identical bytecode, so
  that the original contract's code is recovered. The new contract deployment restores
  the `bytecode hash -> bytecode` entry in the internal state."
