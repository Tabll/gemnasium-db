title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "Flux is an open and extensible continuous delivery solution for Kubernetes.
  Path Traversal in the kustomize-controller via a malicious `kustomization.yaml`
  allows an attacker to expose sensitive data from the controllerâ€™s pod filesystem
  and possibly privilege escalation in multi-tenancy deployments. Workarounds include
  automated tooling in the user's CI/CD pipeline to validate `kustomization.yaml`
  files conform with specific policies. This vulnerability is fixed in kustomize-controller
  v0.24.0 and included in flux2 v0.29.0."
