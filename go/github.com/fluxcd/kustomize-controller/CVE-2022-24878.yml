description: "Flux is an open and extensible continuous delivery solution for Kubernetes.
  Path Traversal in the kustomize-controller via a malicious `kustomization.yaml`
  allows an attacker to cause a Denial of Service at the controller level. Workarounds
  include automated tooling in the user's CI/CD pipeline to validate `kustomization.yaml`
  files conform with specific policies. This vulnerability is fixed in kustomize-controller
  v0.24.0 and included in flux2 v0.29.0. Users are recommended to upgrade."
