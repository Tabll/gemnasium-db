title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "Flux is a tool for keeping Kubernetes clusters in sync with sources
  of configuration (like Git repositories), and automating updates to configuration
  when there is new code to deploy. Flux CLI allows users to deploy Flux components
  into a Kubernetes cluster via command-line. The vulnerability allows other applications
  to replace the Flux deployment information with arbitrary content which is deployed
  into the target Kubernetes cluster instead. The vulnerability is due to the improper
  handling of user-supplied input, which results in a path traversal that can be controlled
  by the attacker. Users sharing the same shell between other applications and the
  Flux CLI commands could be affected by this vulnerability. In some scenarios no
  errors may be presented, which may cause end users not to realize that something
  is amiss. A safe workaround is to execute Flux CLI in ephemeral and isolated shell
  environments, which can ensure no persistent values exist from previous processes.
  However, upgrading to the latest version of the CLI is still the recommended mitigation
  strategy."
