package_slug: "go/github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller"
title: "Improper use of metav1.Duration allows for Denial of Service"
description: "Flux controllers within the affected versions range is vulnerable to
  a denial of service attack. Users that have permissions to change Fluxâ€™s objects,
  either through a Flux source or directly within a cluster, can provide invalid data
  to fields `.spec.interval` or `.spec.timeout` (and structured variations of these
  fields), causing the entire object type to stop being processed.
  
  The issue has two root causes a) the Kubernetes type `metav1.Duration` not being 
  fully compatible with the Go type `time.Duration` as explained on 
  [upstream report](https://github.com/kubernetes/apimachinery/issues/131);
  b) lack of validation within Flux to restrict allowed values."
