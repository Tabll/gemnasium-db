package_slug: "go/github.com/fluxcd/helm-controller"
title: "Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')"
description: "Flux2 is an open and extensible continuous delivery solution for Kubernetes.
  Flux2 versions between 0.1.0 and 0.29.0, helm-controller 0.1.0 to v0.19.0, and kustomize-controller
  0.1.0 to v0.23.0 is vulnerable to Code Injection via malicious Kubeconfig. In multi-tenancy
  deployments this can also lead to privilege escalation if the controller's service
  account has elevated permissions. Workarounds include disabling functionality via
  Validating Admission webhooks by restricting users from setting the `spec.kubeConfig`
  field in Flux `Kustomization` and `HelmRelease` objects. Additional mitigations
  include applying restrictive AppArmor and SELinux profiles on the controllerâ€™s pod
  to limit what binaries can be executed. This vulnerability is fixed in kustomize-controller
  v0.23.0 and helm-controller v0.19.0, both included in flux2 v0.29.0"
