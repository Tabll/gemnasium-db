package_slug: "go/github.com/fluxcd/helm-controller"
title: "Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling"
description: "Flux2 is a tool for keeping Kubernetes clusters in sync with sources
  of configuration, and Flux's helm-controller is a Kubernetes operator that allows
  one to declaratively manage Helm chart releases. Helm controller is tightly integrated
  with the Helm SDK. A vulnerability found in the Helm SDK that affects flux2 v0.0.17
  until v0.32.0 and helm-controller v0.0.4 until v0.23.0 allows for specific data
  inputs to cause high memory consumption. In some platforms, this could cause the
  controller to panic and stop processing reconciliations. In a shared cluster multi-tenancy
  environment, a tenant could create a HelmRelease that makes the controller panic,
  denying all other tenants from their Helm releases being reconciled. Patches are
  available in flux2 v0.32.0 and helm-controller v0.23.0."
