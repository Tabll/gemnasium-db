package_slug: "go/github.com/fluxcd/image-automation-controller/api"
title: "Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input"
description: "Flux is an open and extensible continuous delivery solution for Kubernetes.
  Versions prior to 0.35.0 are subject to a Denial of Service. Users that have permissions
  to change Fluxâ€™s objects, either through a Flux source or directly within a cluster,
  can provide invalid data to fields `.spec.interval` or `.spec.timeout` (and structured
  variations of these fields), causing the entire object type to stop being processed.
  This issue is patched in version 0.35.0. As a workaround, Admission controllers
  can be employed to restrict the values that can be used for fields `.spec.interval`
  and `.spec.timeout`, however upgrading to the latest versions is still the recommended
  mitigation."
