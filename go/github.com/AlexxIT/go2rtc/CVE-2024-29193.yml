title: "gotortc Cross-site Scripting vulnerability"
description: "gotortc is a camera streaming application. Versions 1.8.5 and prior
  are vulnerable to DOM-based cross-site scripting. The index page (`index.html`)
  shows the available streams by fetching the API in the client side. Then, it uses
  `Object.entries` to iterate over the result whose first item (`name`) gets appended
  using `innerHTML`. In the event of a victim visiting the server in question, their
  browser will execute the request against the go2rtc instance. After the request,
  the browser will be redirected to go2rtc, in which the XSS would be executed in
  the context of go2rtcâ€™s origin."
