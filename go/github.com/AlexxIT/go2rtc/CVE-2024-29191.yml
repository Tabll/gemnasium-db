title: "gotortc Cross-site Scripting vulnerability"
description: "gotortc is a camera streaming application. Versions 1.8.5 and prior
  are vulnerable to DOM-based cross-site scripting. The links page (`links.html`)
  appends the `src` GET parameter (`[0]`) in all of its links for 1-click previews.
  The context in which `src` is being appended is `innerHTML` (`[1]`), which will
  insert the text as HTML. Commit 3b3d5b033aac3a019af64f83dec84f70ed2c8aba contains
  a patch for the issue."
