package_slug: "go/code.vegaprotocol.io/vega"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "Vega is a decentralized trading platform that allows pseudo-anonymous
  trading of derivatives on a blockchain. Prior to version 0.71.6, a vulnerability
  exists that allows a malicious validator to trick the Vega network into re-processing
  past Ethereum events from Vega’s Ethereum bridge. For example, a deposit to the
  collateral bridge for 100USDT that credits a party’s general account on Vega, can
  be re-processed 50 times resulting in 5000USDT in that party’s general account.
  This is without depositing any more than the original 100USDT on the bridge. Despite
  this exploit requiring access to a validator's Vega key, a validator key can be
  obtained at the small cost of 3000VEGA, the amount needed to announce a new node
  onto the network.\n\nA patch is available in version 0.71.6. No known workarounds
  are available, however there are mitigations in place should this vulnerability
  be exploited. There are monitoring alerts for `mainnet1` in place to identify any
  issues of this nature including this vulnerability being exploited. The validators
  have the ability to stop the bridge thus stopping any withdrawals should this vulnerability
  be exploited."
