package_slug: "go/gogs.io/gogs"
title: "Gogs has authorization bypass in repository deletion API"
description: "The DELETE /api/v1/repos/:owner/:repo endpoint lacks necessary permission
  validation middleware. Consequently, any user with read access (including read-only
  collaborators) can delete the entire repository.\n\nThis vulnerability stems from
  the API route configuration only utilizing the repoAssignment() middleware (which
  only verifies read access) without enforcing reqRepoOwner() or reqRepoAdmin()."
