description: "### Impact\n\nExpired PAM accounts and accounts with expired passwords
  are continued to be seen as valid. Installations use PAM as authentication sources
  are affected.\n\n### Patches\n\nExpired PAM accounts and accounts with expired passwords
  are no longer being seen as valid. Users should upgrade to 0.12.5 or the latest
  0.13.0+dev.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIn addition to marking PAM accounts as expired,
  also disable/lock them. Running `usermod -L <username>` will add an exclamation
  mark to the password hash and would result in wrong passwords responses when trying
  to login. \n\n### References\n\nhttps://huntr.dev/bounties/ea82cfc9-b55c-41fe-ae58-0d0e0bd7ab62/\n\n###
