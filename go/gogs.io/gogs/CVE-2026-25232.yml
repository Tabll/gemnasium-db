title: "Gogs has a Protected Branch Deletion Bypass in Web Interface"
description: "An access control bypass vulnerability in Gogs web interface allows
  any repository collaborator with Write permissions to delete protected branches
  (including the default branch) by sending a direct POST request, completely bypassing
  the branch protection mechanism. This vulnerability enables privilege escalation
  from Write to Admin level, allowing low-privilege users to perform dangerous operations
  that should be restricted to administrators only.\n\nAlthough Git Hook layer correctly
  prevents protected branch deletion via SSH push, the web interface deletion operation
  does not trigger Git Hooks, resulting in complete bypass of protection mechanisms."
