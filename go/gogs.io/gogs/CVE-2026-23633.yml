title: "Gogs has arbitrary file read/write via Path Traversal in Git hook editing"
description: "## Vulnerability Description\n\nIn the endpoint:\n\n```\n/username/reponame/settings/hooks/git/:name\n```\n\nthe
  `:name` parameter:\n\n* Is URL-decoded by **macaron routing**, allowing decoded
  slashes (`/`)\n* Is then passed directly to:\n\n```go\ngit.Repository.Hook(\"custom_hooks\",
  name)\n```\n\nwhich internally resolves the path as:\n\n```go\nfilepath.Join(repoPath,
  \"custom_hooks\", name)\n```\n\nBecause no path sanitization is applied, supplying
  `../` sequences allows access to **arbitrary paths outside the repository**.\n\n###
  As a Result:\n\n* **GET:** Arbitrary file contents are displayed in the hook edit
  page textarea (**Local File Inclusion**).\n* **POST:** Existing files can be overwritten
  with attacker-controlled content (**Arbitrary File Write**).\n\n---\n\n## Attack
  Prerequisites\n\n* The attacker is an authenticated user\n* The attacker has **Admin
  or higher privileges** on the target repository\n* The attacker has the **AllowGitHook**
  permission (or is a site administrator)\n* The target file is readable/writable
  by the **Gogs process OS permissions**\n\n---\n\n## Attack Scenario\n\n1. An attacker
  (with AllowGitHook + repository Admin privileges) accesses the Git hook edit URL\n2.
  A path containing `../` is supplied in `:name`, fully URL-encoded using `%2f`\n3.
  The server resolves `custom_hooks/../../...` without validation\n4. Arbitrary file
  contents are displayed and existing files can be overwritten\n\n---\n\n## Potential
  Impact\n\n* **Sensitive information disclosure:** `app.ini`, databases, logs, environment
  variables, etc.\n* **Configuration or data tampering:** Overwriting existing files\n*
  **Secondary impact:** Extraction of `SECRET_KEY` and database credentials may allow
  token forging or further compromise"
