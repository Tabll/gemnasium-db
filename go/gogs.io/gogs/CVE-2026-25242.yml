package_slug: "go/gogs.io/gogs"
title: "Unauthenticated File Upload in Gogs"
description: "Gogs exposes unauthenticated file upload endpoints by default. When
  the global RequireSigninView setting is disabled (default), any remote user can
  upload arbitrary files to the server via /releases/attachments and /issues/attachments.
  This enables the instance to be abused as a public file host, potentially leading
  to disk exhaustion, content hosting, or delivery of malware. CSRF tokens do not
  mitigate this attack due to same-origin cookie issuance."
