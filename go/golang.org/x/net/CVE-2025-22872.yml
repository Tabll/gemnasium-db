package_slug: "go/golang.org/x/net"
title: "golang.org/x/net vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting"
description: "The tokenizer incorrectly interprets tags with unquoted attribute values
  that end with a solidus character (/) as self-closing. When directly using Tokenizer,
  this can result in such tags incorrectly being marked as self-closing, and when
  using the Parse functions, this can result in content following such tags as being
  placed in the wrong scope during DOM construction, but only when tags are in foreign
  content (e.g. <math>, <svg>, etc contexts)."
