package_slug: "go/golang.org/x/crypto/openpgp/clearsign"
title: "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature"
description: "A message-forgery issue was discovered in crypto/openpgp/clearsign/clearsign.go
  in supplementary Go cryptography libraries 2019-03-25. According to the OpenPGP
  Message Format specification in RFC 4880 chapter 7, a cleartext signed message can
  contain one or more optional \"Hash\" Armor Headers. The \"Hash\" Armor Header specifies
  the message digest algorithm(s) used for the signature. However, the Go clearsign
  package ignores the value of this header, which allows an attacker to spoof it.
  Consequently, an attacker can lead a victim to believe the signature was generated
  using a different message digest algorithm than what was actually used. Moreover,
  since the library skips Armor Header parsing in general, an attacker can not only
  embed arbitrary Armor Headers, but also prepend arbitrary text to cleartext messages
  without invalidating the signatures."
