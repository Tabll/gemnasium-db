title: "Misuse of ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback may cause authorization bypass in
  golang.org/x/crypto"
description: "Applications and libraries which misuse the ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback
  callback may be susceptible to an authorization bypass.\n\nThe documentation for
  ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback says that \"A call to this function does not guarantee
  that the key offered is in fact used to authenticate.\" Specifically, the SSH protocol
  allows clients to inquire about whether a public key is acceptable before proving
  control of the corresponding private key. PublicKeyCallback may be called with multiple
  keys, and the order in which the keys were provided cannot be used to infer which
  key the client successfully authenticated with, if any. Some applications, which
  store the key(s) passed to PublicKeyCallback (or derived information) and make security
  relevant determinations based on it once the connection is established, may make
  incorrect assumptions.\n\nFor example, an attacker may send public keys A and B,
  and then authenticate with A. PublicKeyCallback would be called only twice, first
  with A and then with B. A vulnerable application may then make authorization decisions
  based on key B for which the attacker does not actually control the private key.\n\nSince
  this API is widely misused, as a partial mitigation golang.org/x/cry...@v0.31.0
  enforces the property that, when successfully authenticating via public key, the
  last key passed to ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback will be the key used to authenticate
  the connection. PublicKeyCallback will now be called multiple times with the same
  key, if necessary. Note that the client may still not control the last key passed
  to PublicKeyCallback if the connection is then authenticated with a different method,
  such as PasswordCallback, KeyboardInteractiveCallback, or NoClientAuth.\n\nUsers
  should be using the Extensions field of the Permissions return value from the various
  authentication callbacks to record data associated with the authentication attempt
  instead of referencing external state. Once the connection is established the state
  corresponding to the successful authentication attempt can be retrieved via the
  ServerConn.Permissions field. Note that some third-party libraries misuse the Permissions
  type by sharing it across authentication attempts; users of third-party libraries
  should refer to the relevant projects for guidance."
