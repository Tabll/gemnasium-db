identifier: "CVE-2020-14040"
package_slug: "go/golang.org/x/text"
title: "Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition (Infinite Loop)"
description: "The `x/text` package for Go has a vulnerability in `encoding/unicode`
  that could lead to the `UTF-16` decoder entering an infinite loop, causing the program
  to crash or run out of memory. An attacker could provide a single byte to a `UTF16`
  decoder instantiated with `UseBOM` or `ExpectBOM` to trigger an infinite loop if
  the String function on the Decoder is called, or the Decoder is passed to `golang.org/x/text/transform.String`."
