package_slug: "go/golang.org/x/text"
title: "golang.org/x/text/language Denial of service via crafted Accept-Language header"
description: "The BCP 47 tag parser has quadratic time complexity due to inherent
  aspects of its design. Since the parser is, by design, exposed to untrusted user
  input, this can be leveraged to force a program to consume significant time parsing
  Accept-Language headers. The parser cannot be easily rewritten to fix this behavior
  for various reasons. Instead the solution implemented in this CL is to limit the
  total complexity of tags passed into ParseAcceptLanguage by limiting the number
  of dashes in the string to 1000. This should be more than enough for the majority
  of real world use cases, where the number of tags being sent is likely to be in
  the single digits."
