title: "Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')"
description: "The x/text package before 0.3.3 for Go has a vulnerability in encoding/unicode
  that could lead to the UTF-16 decoder entering an infinite loop, causing the program
  to crash or run out of memory. An attacker could provide a single byte to a UTF16
  decoder instantiated with UseBOM or ExpectBOM to trigger an infinite loop if the
  String function on the Decoder is called, or the Decoder is passed to golang.org/x/text/transform.String."
