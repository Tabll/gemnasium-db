package_slug: "go/goauthentik.io"
title: "authentik's invitation expiry is delayed by at least 5 minutes"
description: "In previous authentik versions, invitations were considered valid regardless
  if they are expired or not, thus relying on background tasks to clean up expired
  ones. In a normal scenario this can take up to 5 minutes because the cleanup of
  expired objects is scheduled to run every 5 minutes. However, with a large amount
  of tasks in the backlog, this might take longer."
