package_slug: "go/goauthentik.io"
title: "Authentik has insufficient check for account active status when authenticating
  with OAuth/SAML Sources"
description: "Deactivated users that had either enrolled via OAuth/SAML or had their
  account connected to an OAuth/SAML account can still partially access authentik
  even if their account is deactivated. They end up in a half-authenticated state
  where they cannot access the API but crucially they can authorize applications if
  they know the URL of the application."
