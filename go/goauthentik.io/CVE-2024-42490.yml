title: "GoAuthentik vulnerable to Insufficient Authorization for several API endpoints"
description: "Several API endpoints can be accessed by users without correct authentication/authorization.\n\nThe
  main API endpoints affected by this:\n\n-   `/api/v3/crypto/certificatekeypairs/<uuid>/view_certificate/`\n-
  \  `/api/v3/crypto/certificatekeypairs/<uuid>/view_private_key/`\n-   `/api/v3/.../used_by/`\n\nNote
  that all of the affected API endpoints require the knowledge of the ID of an object,
  which especially for certificates is not accessible to an unprivileged user. Additionally
  the IDs for most objects are UUIDv4, meaning they are not easily guessable/enumerable."
