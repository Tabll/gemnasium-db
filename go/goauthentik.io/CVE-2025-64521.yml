title: "authentik allows a deactivated Service account to authenticate to OAuth"
description: "When authenticating with `client_id` and `client_secret` to an OAuth
  provider, authentik creates a service account for the provider. In previous authentik
  versions, authentication for this account was possible even when the account was

  still take assigned policies correctly into account."
