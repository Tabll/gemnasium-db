title: "Improper Validation of Array Index"
description: "In etcd before versions 3.3.23 and 3.4.10, it is possible to have an
  entry index greater then the number of entries in the ReadAll method in wal/wal.go.
  This could cause issues when WAL entries are being read during consensus as an arbitrary
  etcd consensus participant could go down from a runtime panic when reading the entry."
