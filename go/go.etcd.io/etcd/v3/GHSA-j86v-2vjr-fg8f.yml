title: "Etcd Gateway TLS endpoint validation only confirms TCP reachability"
description: "### Vulnerability type\nCryptography\n\n### Workarounds\nRefer to the
  [gateway documentation](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/op-guide/gateway.md).
  The vulnerability was spotted due to unclear documentation of how the gateway handles
  endpoints validation. \n\n### Detail\nSecure endpoint validation is performed by
  the etcd gateway start command when the --discovery-srv flag is enabled. However,
  as currently implemented, it only validates TCP reachability, effectively allowing
  connections to an endpoint that doesn't accept TLS connections through the HTTPS
  URL. The auditors has noted that appropriate documentation of this validation functionality
  plus deprecation of this misleading functionality is an acceptable path forward.\n\n###
