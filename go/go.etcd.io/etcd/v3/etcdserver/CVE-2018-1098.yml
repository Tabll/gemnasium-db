package_slug: "go/go.etcd.io/etcd/v3/etcdserver"
title: "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
description: "A cross-site request forgery flaw was found in etcd 3.3.1 and earlier.
  An attacker can set up a website that tries to send a POST request to the etcd server
  and modify a key. Adding a key is done with PUT so it is theoretically safe (can't
  PUT from an HTML form or such) but POST allows creating in-order keys that an attacker
  can send."
