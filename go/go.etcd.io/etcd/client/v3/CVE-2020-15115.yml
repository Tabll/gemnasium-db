package_slug: "go/go.etcd.io/etcd/client/v3"
title: "Weak Password Requirements"
description: "etcd before versions 3.3.23 and 3.4.10 does not perform any password
  length validation, which allows for very short passwords, such as those with a length
  of one. This may allow an attacker to guess or brute-force users' passwords with
  little computational effort."
