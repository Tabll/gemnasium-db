title: "Missing Authentication for Critical Function"
description: "In ectd before versions 3.4.10 and 3.3.23, gateway TLS authentication
  is only applied to endpoints detected in DNS SRV records. When starting a gateway,
  TLS authentication will only be attempted on endpoints identified in DNS SRV records
  for a given domain, which occurs in the discoverEndpoints function. No authentication
  is performed against endpoints provided in the --endpoints flag. This has been fixed
  in versions 3.4.10 and 3.3.23 with improved documentation and deprecation of the
  functionality."
