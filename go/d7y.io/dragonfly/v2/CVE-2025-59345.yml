title: "Dragonfly doesn't have authentication enabled for some Managerâ€™s endpoints"
description: "The /api/v1/jobs and /preheats endpoints in Manager web UI are accessible
  without authentication. Any user with network access to the Manager can create,
  delete, and modify jobs, and create preheat jobs.\n\nAn unauthenticated adversary
  with network access to a Manager web UI uses /api/v1/jobs endpoint to create hundreds
  of useless jobs. The Manager is in a denial-of-service state, and stops accepting
  requests from valid administrators."
