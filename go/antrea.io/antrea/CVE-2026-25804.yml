title: "Antrea has invalid enforcement order for network policy rules caused by integer
  overflow"
description: "Antrea's network policy priority assignment system has a uint16 arithmetic
  overflow bug that causes incorrect OpenFlow priority calculations when handling
  a large numbers of policies with various priority values. This results in potentially
  incorrect traffic enforcement.\n\nIf a user creates a large number of Antrea NetworkPolicies
  (ANP or ACNP) with varying priorities, some rules with lower logical priorities
  (higher numerical priority values) may take precedence over rules with higher logical
  priorities (lower numerical priority values). Traffic that should be denied by the
  configured Antrea NetworkPolicies may end up being allowed, potentially letting
  an attacker access a sensitive service. Traffic that should be allowed by the configured
  Antrea NetworkPolicies may end up being denied, breaking applications and potentially
  opening the door for denial-of-service attacks.\n\nThe Antrea NetworkPolicy system
  comes with support for priority Tiers. Rules defined within a Tier cannot take precedence
  over rules defined in higher priority Tiers. Some users / roles may only be authorized
  to define within specific Tiers. This security vulnerability enables such users
  to intentionally \"escape\" their Tier and override rules in higher priority Tiers.\n\nAntrea
  deployments that *only* use upstream Kubernetes NetworkPolicies - and do not use
  Antrea NetworkPolicies - are not affected."
