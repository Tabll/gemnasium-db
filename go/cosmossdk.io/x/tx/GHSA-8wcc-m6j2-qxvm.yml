title: "CosmosSDK: Transaction decoding may result in a stack overflow or resource
  exhaustion "
description: "### ASA-2024-0012: Transaction decoding may result in a stack overflow\nWhen
  decoding a maliciously formed packet with a deeply-nested structure, it may be possible
  for a stack overflow to occur and result in a network halt. This was addressed by
  adding a recursion limit while decoding the packet.\n### ASA-2024-0013: Transaction
  decoding may result in resource exhaustion\nNested messages in a transaction can
  consume exponential cpu and memory on `UnpackAny` calls. The `max_tx_bytes` sets
  a limit for external TX but is not applied for internal messages emitted by wasm
  contracts or a malicious validator block. This may result in a node crashing due
  to resource exhaustion. This was addressed by adding additional validation to prevent
  this condition."
