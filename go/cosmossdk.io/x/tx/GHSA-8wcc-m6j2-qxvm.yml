description: "### ASA-2024-0012: Transaction decoding may result in a stack overflow

  When decoding a maliciously formed packet with a deeply-nested structure,
  it may be possible for a stack overflow to occur and result in a network halt.
  This was addressed by adding a recursion limit while decoding the packet.

  ### ASA-2024-0013: Transaction decoding may result in resource exhaustion

  Nested messages in a transaction can consume exponential cpu and memory on `UnpackAny` calls.
  The `max_tx_bytes` sets a limit for external TX but is not applied for internal messages emitted
  by wasm contracts or a malicious validator block.
  This may result in a node crashing due to resource exhaustion.
  This was addressed by adding additional validation to prevent this condition."
