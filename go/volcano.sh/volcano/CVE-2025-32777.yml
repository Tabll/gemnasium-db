title: "Volcano Scheduler Denial of Service via Unbounded Response from Elastic Service/extender
  Plugin"
description: "This issue allows an attacker who has compromised either the Elastic
  service or the extender plugin to cause denial of service of the scheduler. This
  is a privilege escalation, because Volcano users may run their Elastic service and
  extender plugins in separate pods or nodes from the scheduler. In the Kubernetes
  security model, node isolation is a security boundary, and as such an attacker is
  able to cross that boundary in Volcano's case if they have compromised either the
  vulnerable services or the pod/node in which they are deployed.  The scheduler will
  become unavailable to other users and workloads in the cluster. The scheduler will
  either crash with an unrecoverable OOM panic or freeze while consuming excessive
  amounts of memory."
