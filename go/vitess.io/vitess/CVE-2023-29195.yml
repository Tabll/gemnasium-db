package_slug: "go/vitess.io/vitess"
title: "Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions"
description: "Vitess is a database clustering system for horizontal scaling of MySQL
  through generalized sharding. Prior to version 16.0.2, users can either intentionally
  or inadvertently create a shard containing `/` characters from VTAdmin such that
  from that point on, anyone who tries to create a new shard from VTAdmin will receive
  an error. Attempting to view the keyspace(s) will also no longer work. Creating
  a shard using `vtctldclient` does not have the same problem because the CLI validates
  the input correctly. Version 16.0.2, corresponding to version 0.16.2 of the `go`
  module, contains a patch for this issue. Some workarounds are available. Always
  use `vtctldclient` to create shards, instead of using VTAdmin; disable creating
  shards from VTAdmin using RBAC; and/or delete the topology record for the offending
  shard using the client for your topology server."
