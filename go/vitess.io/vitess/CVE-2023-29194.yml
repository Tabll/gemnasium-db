package_slug: "go/vitess.io/vitess"
title: "vitess allows users to create keyspaces that can deny access to already existing
  keyspaces"
description: "### Impact\nUsers can either intentionally or inadvertently create a
  keyspace containing `/` characters such that from that point on, anyone who tries
  to view keyspaces from VTAdmin will receive an error. Trying to list all the keyspaces
  using `vtctldclient GetKeyspaces` will also return an error.\nNote that all other
  keyspaces can still be administered using the CLI (vtctldclient).\n\n### Patches\nv16.0.1
  (corresponding to 0.16.1 on pkg.go.dev)\n\n### Workarounds\nDelete the offending
  keyspace using a CLI client (vtctldclient) \n```\nvtctldclient --server ... DeleteKeyspace
  a/b\n```\n\nFound during a security audit sponsored by the [CNCF](https://cncf.io)
  and facilitated by [OSTIF](https://ostif.org)."
