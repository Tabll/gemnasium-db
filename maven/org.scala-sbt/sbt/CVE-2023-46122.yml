package_slug: "maven/org.scala-sbt/sbt"
title: "sbt vulnerable to arbitrary file write via archive extraction (Zip Slip)"
description: "sbt is a build tool for Scala, Java, and others. Given a specially crafted
  zip or JAR file, `IO.unzip` allows writing of arbitrary file. This would have potential
  to overwrite `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`. Within sbt's main code, `IO.unzip` is
  used in `pullRemoteCache` task and `Resolvers.remote`; however many projects use
  `IO.unzip(...)` directly to implement custom tasks. This vulnerability has been
  patched in version 1.9.7."
