title: "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
description: "MeterSphere is a one-stop open source continuous testing platform, covering
  test management, interface testing, UI testing and performance testing. Versions
  prior to 2.5.0 are subject to a Server-Side Request Forgery that leads to Cross-Site
  Scripting. A Server-Side request forgery in `IssueProxyResourceService::getMdImageByUrl`
  allows an attacker to access internal resources, as well as executing JavaScript
  code in the context of Metersphere's origin by a victim of a reflected XSS. This
  vulnerability has been fixed in v2.5.0. There are no known workarounds."
