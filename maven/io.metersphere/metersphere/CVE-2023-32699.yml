package_slug: "maven/io.metersphere/metersphere"
title: "Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling"
description: "MeterSphere is an open source continuous testing platform. Version 2.9.1
  and prior is vulnerable to denial of service. ?The `checkUserPassword` method is
  used to check whether the password provided by the user matches the password saved
  in the database, and the `CodingUtil.md5` method is used to encrypt the original
  password with MD5 to ensure that the password will not be saved in plain text when
  it is stored. If a user submits a very long password when logging in, the system
  will be forced to execute the long password MD5 encryption process, causing the
  server CPU and memory to be exhausted, thereby causing a denial of service attack
  on the server. This issue is fixed in version 2.10.0-lts with a maximum password
  length."
