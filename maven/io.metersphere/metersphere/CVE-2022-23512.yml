title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "MeterSphere is a one-stop open source continuous testing platform. Versions
  prior to 2.4.1 is vulnerable to Path Injection in ApiTestCaseService::deleteBodyFiles
  which takes a user-controlled string id and passes it to ApiTestCaseService, which
  uses the user-provided value (testId) in new File(BODY_FILE_DIR + \"/\" + testId),
  being deleted later by file.delete(). By adding some camouflage parameters to the
  url, an attacker can target files on the server. The vulnerability has been fixed
  in v2.4.1."
