title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "metersphere is an open source continuous testing platform. In versions
  prior to 2.7.1 a user who has permission to create a resource file through UI operations
  is able to append a path to their submission query which will be read by the system
  and displayed to the user. This allows a users of the system to read arbitrary files
  on the filesystem of the server so long as the server process itself has permission
  to read the requested files. This issue has been addressed in version 2.7.1. All
  users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue."
