title: "Vulnerability in RPKI manifest validation"
description: "\nA vulnerability in RPKI manifest validation exists when objects on
  the manifest are hidden, or expired objects are replayed. An attacker successfully
  exploiting this vulnerability could prevent new ROAs from being received or selectively
  hide ROAs, causing routes to become INVALID.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an
  attacker would need to perform a man in the middle attack on the TLS connection
  between the validator and an RRDP repository or perform a man in the middle attack
  against a rsync-only repository.\n\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by implementing
  validation methods from [RFC 6486bis](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sidrops-6486bis/00/)
  and enabling strict validation by default."
