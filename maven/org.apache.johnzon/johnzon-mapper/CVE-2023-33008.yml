title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability in Apache Software Foundation
  Apache Johnzon.\n\n\nA malicious attacker can craft up some JSON input that uses
  large numbers (numbers such asÂ 1e20000000) that Apache Johnzon will deserialize
  into BigDecimal and maybe use numbers too large which may result in a slow conversion
  (Denial of service risk). Apache Johnzon 1.2.21 mitigates this by setting a scale
  limit of 1000 (by default) to the BigDecimal. \n\n\nThis issue affects Apache Johnzon:
  through 1.2.20.\n\n"
