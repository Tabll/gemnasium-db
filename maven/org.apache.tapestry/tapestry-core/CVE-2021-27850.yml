identifier: "CVE-2021-27850"
package_slug: "maven/org.apache.tapestry/tapestry-core"
title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "A critical unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability was found
  in Apache Tapestry. The vulnerability found is a bypass of the fix for CVE-2019-0195.
  Before the fix of CVE-2019-0195 it was possible to download arbitrary class files 
  from the classpath by providing a crafted asset file URL. An attacker was able to 
  download the file `AppModule.class` by requesting the URL 
  `http://localhost:8080/assets/something/services/AppModule.class` which
  contains a HMAC secret key. The fix for that bug was an ignore filter that checks
  if the URL ends with `.class`, `.properties` or `.xml`. Unfortunately, the
  ignore list solution can simply be bypassed by appending a `/` at the end of the URL
  `http://localhost:8080/assets/something/services/AppModule.class/` The slash is
  stripped after the ignore list check and the file `AppModule.class` is loaded into
  the response. This class usually contains the HMAC secret key which is used to sign
  serialized Java objects. With the knowledge of that key an attacker can sign a Java
  gadget chain that leads to RCE (e.g. `CommonsBeanUtils1` from `ysoserial`)."
