package_slug: "maven/org.apache.tapestry/tapestry-core"
title: "Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)"
description: "Apache Tapestry up to version 5.8.1 is vulnerable to Regular Expression
  Denial of Service (ReDoS) in the way it handles Content Types. Specially crafted
  Content Types may cause catastrophic backtracking, taking exponential time to complete.
  Specifically, this is about the regular expression used on the parameter of the
  org.apache.tapestry5.http.ContentType class. Apache Tapestry 5.8.2 has a fix for
  this vulnerability. Notice the vulnerability cannot be triggered by web requests
  in Tapestry code alone. It would only happen if there's some non-Tapestry codepath
  passing some outside input to the ContentType class constructor."
