identifier: "CVE-2019-0195"
package_slug: "maven/org.apache.tapestry/tapestry-core"
title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "Manipulating classpath asset file URLs, an attacker could guess the
  path to a known file in the classpath and have it downloaded. If the attacker found
  the file with the value of the `tapestry.hmac-passphrase` configuration symbol,
  most probably the webapp's AppModule class, the value of this symbol could be used
  to craft a Java deserialization attack, thus running malicious injected Java code.
  The vector would be the `t:formdata` parameter from the Form component."
