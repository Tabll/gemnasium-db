identifier: "CVE-2019-10071"
package_slug: "maven/org.apache.tapestry/tapestry-core"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "The code which checks HMAC in form submissions used `String.equals()`
  for comparisons, which results in a timing side channel for the comparison of the
  HMAC signatures. This could lead to remote code execution if an attacker is able
  to determine the correct signature for their payload. The comparison should be done
  with a constant time algorithm instead."
