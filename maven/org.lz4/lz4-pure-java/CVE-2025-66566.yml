title: "yawkat LZ4 Java has a possible information leak in Java safe decompressor"
description: "Insufficient clearing of the output buffer in Java-based decompressor
  implementations in lz4-java 1.10.0 and earlier allows remote attackers to read previous
  buffer contents via crafted compressed input. In applications where the output buffer
  is reused without being cleared, this may lead to disclosure of sensitive data.\n\nJNI-based
  implementations are *not* affected."
