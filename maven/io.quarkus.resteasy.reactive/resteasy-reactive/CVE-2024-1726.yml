title: "Quarkus: security checks in resteasy reactive may trigger a denial of service"
description: "A flaw was discovered in the RESTEasy Reactive implementation in Quarkus.
  Due to security checks for some JAX-RS endpoints being performed after serialization,
  more processing resources are consumed while the HTTP request is checked. In certain
  configurations, if an attacker has knowledge of any POST, PUT, or PATCH request
  paths, they can potentially identify vulnerable endpoints and trigger excessive
  resource usage as the endpoints process the requests. This can result in a denial
  of service."
