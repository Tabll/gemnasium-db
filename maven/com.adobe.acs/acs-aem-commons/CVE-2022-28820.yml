title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "ACS Commons version 5.1.x (and earlier) suffers from a Reflected Cross-site
  Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in `/apps/acs-commons/content/page-compare.html` endpoint
  via the `a` and `b` GET parameters. User input submitted via these parameters is not
  validated or sanitised. An attacker must provide a link to someone with access to
  AEM Author, and could potentially exploit this vulnerability to inject malicious
  JavaScript content into vulnerable form fields and execute it within the context
  of the victim's browser. The exploitation of this issue requires user interaction
  in order to be successful."
