identifier: "CVE-2020-13955"
package_slug: "maven/org.apache.calcite/calcite-core"
title: "Missing Authentication for Critical Function"
description: "`HttpUtils#getURLConnection` method disables explicitly hostname verification
  for HTTPS connections making clients vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. Calcite
  uses internally this method to connect with Druid and Splunk so information leakage
  may happen when using the respective Calcite adapters. The method itself is in a
  utility class so people may use it to create vulnerable HTTPS connections for other
  applications. From Apache Calcite onwards, the hostname verification will be performed
  using the default JVM truststore."
