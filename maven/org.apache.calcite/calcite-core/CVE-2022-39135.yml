package_slug: "maven/org.apache.calcite/calcite-core"
title: "Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference"
description: "In Apache Calcite prior to version 1.32.0 the SQL operators EXISTS_NODE,
  EXTRACT_XML, XML_TRANSFORM and EXTRACT_VALUE do not restrict XML External Entity
  references in their configuration, which makes them vulnerable to a potential XML
  External Entity (XXE) attack. Therefore any client exposing these operators, typically
  by using Oracle dialect (the first three) or MySQL dialect (the last one), is affected
  by this vulnerability (the extent of it will depend on the user under which the
  application is running). From Apache Calcite 1.32.0 onwards, Document Type Declarations
  and XML External Entity resolution are disabled on the impacted operators."
