package_slug: "maven/io.jmix.localfs/jmix-localfs"
title: "io.jmix.localfs:jmix-localfs affected by DoS in the Local File Storage"
description: "The local file storage implementation does not restrict the size of
  uploaded files. An attacker could exploit this by uploading excessively large files,
  potentially causing the server to run out of space and return HTTP 500 error, resulting
  in a denial of service.\n\nThe severity of the vulnerability is mitigated by the
  fact that the application UI and the generic REST API are typically accessible only
  to authenticated users. Additionally, the /files endpoint in Jmix requires specific
  permissions and is disabled by default."
