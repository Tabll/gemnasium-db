package_slug: "maven/com.google.protobuf/protobuf-java"
title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "A parsing issue similar to CVE-2022-3171, but with Message-Type Extensions
  in protobuf-java core and lite versions prior to 3.21.7, 3.20.3, 3.19.6 and 3.16.3
  can lead to a denial of service attack. Inputs containing multiple instances of
  non-repeated embedded messages with repeated or unknown fields causes objects to
  be converted back-n-forth between mutable and immutable forms, resulting in potentially
  long garbage collection pauses. We recommend updating to the versions mentioned
  above."
