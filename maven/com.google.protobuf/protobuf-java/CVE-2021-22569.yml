identifiers:
- "CVE-2021-22569"
package_slug: "maven/com.google.protobuf/protobuf-java"
title: "Denial of Service"
description: "An issue in protobuf-java allowed the interleaving of 
  `com.google.protobuf.UnknownFieldSet` fields in such a way that would be processed 
  out of order. A small malicious payload can occupy the parser for several minutes 
  by creating large numbers of short-lived objects that cause frequent, repeated 
  pauses. We recommend upgrading libraries beyond the vulnerable versions."
