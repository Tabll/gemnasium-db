package_slug: "maven/com.google.protobuf/protobuf-java"
title: "Protobuf Java vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "A parsing issue similar to CVE-2022-3171, but with textformat in protobuf-java
  core and lite versions prior to 3.21.7, 3.20.3, 3.19.6 and 3.16.3 can lead to a
  denial of service attack. Inputs containing multiple instances of non-repeated embedded
  messages with repeated or unknown fields causes objects to be converted back-n-forth
  between mutable and immutable forms, resulting in potentially long garbage collection
  pauses. We recommend updating to the versions mentioned above."
