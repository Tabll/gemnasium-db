title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "A parsing issue with binary data in protobuf-java core and lite versions
  prior to 3.21.7, 3.20.3, 3.19.6 and 3.16.3 can lead to a denial of service attack.
  Inputs containing multiple instances of non-repeated embedded messages with repeated
  or unknown fields causes objects to be converted back-n-forth between mutable and
  immutable forms, resulting in potentially long garbage collection pauses. We recommend
  updating to the versions mentioned above."
