package_slug: "maven/com.google.protobuf/protobuf-kotlin"
title: "Denial Of Service"
description: "An issue in protobuf-java allowed the interleaving of `com.google.protobuf.UnknownFieldSet`
  fields in such a way that would be processed out of order. A small malicious payload
  can occupy the parser for several minutes by creating large numbers of short-lived
  objects that cause frequent, repeated pauses. We recommend upgrading libraries beyond
  the vulnerable versions."
