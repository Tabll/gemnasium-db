package_slug: "maven/org.apache.hbase/hbase"
title: "Moderate severity vulnerability that affects org.apache.hbase:hbase"
description: "In all previously released Apache HBase 2.x versions (2.0.0-2.0.4, 2.1.0-2.1.3),
  authorization was incorrectly applied to users of the HBase REST server. Requests
  sent to the HBase REST server were executed with the permissions of the REST server
  itself, not with the permissions of the end-user. This issue is only relevant when
  HBase is configured with Kerberos authentication, HBase authorization is enabled,
  and the REST server is configured with SPNEGO authentication. This issue does not
  extend beyond the HBase REST server."
