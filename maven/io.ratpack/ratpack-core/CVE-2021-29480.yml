identifier: "CVE-2021-29480"
package_slug: "maven/io.ratpack/ratpack-core"
title: "Use of Insufficiently Random Values"
description: "Ratpack is a toolkit for creating web applications., the client side
  session module uses the application startup time as the signing key by default.
  This means that if an attacker can determine this time, and if encryption is not
  also used (which is recommended, but is not on by default), the session data could
  be tampered with by someone with the ability to write cookies. The default configuration
  is unsuitable for production use as an application restart renders all sessions
  invalid and is not multi-host compatible, but its use is not actively prevented.
  As of Ratpack, the default value is a securely randomly generated value, generated
  at application startup time. As a workaround, supply an alternative signing key,
  as per the documentation's recommendation."
