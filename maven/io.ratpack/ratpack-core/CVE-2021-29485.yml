identifier: "CVE-2021-29485"
package_slug: "maven/io.ratpack/ratpack-core"
title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "Ratpack is a toolkit for creating web applications., a malicious attacker
  can achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) via a maliciously crafted Java deserialization
  gadget chain leveraged against the Ratpack session store. If one's application does
  not use Ratpack's session mechanism, it is not vulnerable. Ratpack introduces a
  strict allow-list mechanism that mitigates this vulnerability when used. Two possible
  workarounds exist. The simplest mitigation for users of earlier versions is to reduce
  the likelihood of attackers being able to write to the session data store. Alternatively
  or additionally, the allow-list mechanism could be manually back ported by providing
  an alternative implementation of `SessionSerializer` that uses an allow-list."
