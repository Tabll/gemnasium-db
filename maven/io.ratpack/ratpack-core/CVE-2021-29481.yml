identifier: "CVE-2021-29481"
package_slug: "maven/io.ratpack/ratpack-core"
title: "Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information"
description: "Ratpack is a toolkit for creating web applications., the default configuration
  of client side sessions results in unencrypted, but signed, data being set as cookie
  values. This means that if something sensitive goes into the session, it could be
  read by something with access to the cookies. For this to be a vulnerability, some
  kind of sensitive data would need to be stored in the session and the session cookie
  would have to leak. For example, the cookies are not configured with httpOnly and
  an adjacent XSS vulnerability within the site allowed capture of the cookies. As
  of, a securely randomly generated signing key is used. As a workaround, one may
  supply an encryption key, as per the documentation recommendation."
