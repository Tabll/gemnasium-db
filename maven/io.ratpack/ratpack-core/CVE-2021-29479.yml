identifier: "CVE-2021-29479"
package_slug: "maven/io.ratpack/ratpack-core"
title: "HTTP Request Smuggling"
description: "A user supplied `X-Forwarded-Host` header can be used to perform cache
  poisoning of a cache fronting a Ratpack server if the cache key does not include
  the `X-Forwarded-Host` header as a cache key. Users are only vulnerable if they
  do not configure a custom `PublicAddress` instance. F, by default, Ratpack utilizes
  an inferring version of `PublicAddress` which is vulnerable. This can be used to
  perform redirect cache poisoning where an attacker can force a cached redirect to
  redirect to their site instead of the intended redirect location. The vulnerability
  was patched in Ratpack As a workaround, ensure that `ServerConfigBuilder::publicAddress`
  correctly configures the server in production."
