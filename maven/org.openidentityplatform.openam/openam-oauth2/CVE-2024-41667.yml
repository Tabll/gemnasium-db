package_slug: "maven/org.openidentityplatform.openam/openam-oauth2"
title: "OpenAM FreeMarker template injection"
description: "OpenAM is an open access management solution. In versions 15.0.3 and
  prior, the `getCustomLoginUrlTemplate` method in RealmOAuth2ProviderSettings.java
  is vulnerable to template injection due to its usage of user input. Although the
  developer intended to implement a custom URL for handling login to override the
  default PingOne Advanced Identity Cloud login page,they did not restrict the `CustomLoginUrlTemplate`,
  allowing it to be set freely. Commit fcb8432aa77d5b2e147624fe954cb150c568e0b8 introduces
  `TemplateClassResolver.SAFER_RESOLVER` to disable the resolution of commonly exploited
  classes in FreeMarker template injection. As of time of publication, this fix is
  expected to be part of version 15.0.4."
