package_slug: "maven/org.openidentityplatform.openam/openam-federation-library"
title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "Open Access Management (OpenAM) is an access management solution that
  includes Authentication, SSO, Authorization, Federation, Entitlements and Web Services
  Security. OpenAM up to version 14.7.2 does not properly validate the signature of
  SAML responses received as part of the SAMLv1.x Single Sign-On process. Attackers
  can use this fact to impersonate any OpenAM user, including the administrator, by
  sending a specially crafted SAML response to the SAMLPOSTProfileServlet servlet.
  This problem has been patched in OpenAM 14.7.3-SNAPSHOT and later. User unable to
  upgrade should comment servlet `SAMLPOSTProfileServlet` from their pom file. See
  the linked GHSA for details."
