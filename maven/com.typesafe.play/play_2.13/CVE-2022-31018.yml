title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "Play Framework is a web framework for Java and Scala. A denial of service
  vulnerability has been discovered in verions 2.8.3 through 2.8.15 of Play's forms
  library, in both the Scala and Java APIs. This can occur when using either the `Form#bindFromRequest`
  method on a JSON request body or the `Form#bind` method directly on a JSON value.
  If the JSON data being bound to the form contains a deeply-nested JSON object or
  array, the form binding implementation may consume all available heap space and
  cause an `OutOfMemoryError`. If executing on the default dispatcher and `akka.jvm-exit-on-fatal-error`
  is enabled—as it is by default—then this can crash the application process. `Form.bindFromRequest`
  is vulnerable when using any body parser that produces a type of `AnyContent` or
  `JsValue` in Scala, or one that can produce a `JsonNode` in Java. This includes
  Play's default body parser. This vulnerability been patched in version 2.8.16. There
  is now a global limit on the depth of a JSON object that can be parsed, which can
  be configured by the user if necessary. As a workaround, applications that do not
  need to parse a request body of type `application/json` can switch from the default
  body parser to another body parser that supports only the specific type of body
  they expect."
