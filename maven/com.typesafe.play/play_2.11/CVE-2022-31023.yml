title: "Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information"
description: "Play Framework is a web framework for Java and Scala. Verions prior
  to 2.8.16 is vulnerable to generation of error messages containing sensitive information.
  Play Framework, when run in dev mode, shows verbose errors for easy debugging, including
  an exception stack trace. Play does this by configuring its `DefaultHttpErrorHandler`
  to do so based on the application mode. In its Scala API Play also provides a static
  object `DefaultHttpErrorHandler` that is configured to always show verbose errors.
  This is used as a default value in some Play APIs, so it is possible to inadvertently
  use this version in production. It is also possible to improperly configure the
  `DefaultHttpErrorHandler` object instance as the injected error handler. Both of
  these situations could result in verbose errors displaying to users in a production
  application, which could expose sensitive information from the application. In particular,
  the constructor for `CORSFilter` and `apply` method for `CORSActionBuilder` use
  the static object `DefaultHttpErrorHandler` as a default value. This is patched
  in Play Framework 2.8.16. The `DefaultHttpErrorHandler` object has been changed
  to use the prod-mode behavior, and `DevHttpErrorHandler` has been introduced for
  the dev-mode behavior. A workaround is available. When constructing a `CORSFilter`
  or `CORSActionBuilder`, ensure that a properly-configured error handler is passed.
  Generally this should be done by using the `HttpErrorHandler` instance provided
  through dependency injection or through Play's `BuiltInComponents`. Ensure that
  the application is not using the `DefaultHttpErrorHandler` static object in any
  code that may be run in production."
