title: "Apache Struts Extras Before 2 has an Improper Output Neutralization for Logs
  Vulnerability"
description: "** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** Improper Output Neutralization for Logs
  vulnerability in Apache Struts.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Struts Extras: before
  2.\n\nWhen using LookupDispatchAction, in some cases, Struts may print untrusted
  input to the logs without any filtering. Specially-crafted input may lead to log
  output where part of the message masquerades as a separate log line, confusing consumers
  of the logs (either human or automated).\n\nAs this project is retired, we do not
  plan to release a version that fixes this issue. Users are recommended to find an
  alternative or restrict access to the instance to trusted users.\n\nNOTE: This vulnerability
  only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer."
