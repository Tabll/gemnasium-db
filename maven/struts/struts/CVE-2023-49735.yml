title: "Apache Tiles: Unvalidated input may lead to path traversal and XXE"
description: "The value set as the DefaultLocaleResolver.LOCALE_KEY attribute on the
  session was not validated while resolving XML definition files, leading to possible
  path traversal and eventually SSRF/XXE when passing user-controlled data to this
  key. Passing user-controlled data to this key may be relatively common, as it was
  also used like that to set the language in the 'tiles-test' application shipped
  with Tiles.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Tiles from version 2 onwards.\n\nNOTE:
  This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer."
