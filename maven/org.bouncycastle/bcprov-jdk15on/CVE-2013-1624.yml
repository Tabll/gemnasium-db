title: "Improper Input Validation in Bouncy Castle"
description: "The TLS implementation in the Bouncy Castle Java library before 1.48
  and C# library before 1.8 does not properly consider timing side-channel attacks
  on a noncompliant MAC check operation during the processing of malformed CBC padding,
  which allows remote attackers to conduct distinguishing attacks and plaintext-recovery
  attacks via statistical analysis of timing data for crafted packets, a related issue
  to CVE-2013-0169."
