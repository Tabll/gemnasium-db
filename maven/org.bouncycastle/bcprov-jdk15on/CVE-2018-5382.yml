package_slug: "maven/org.bouncycastle/bcprov-jdk15on"
title: "Improper Validation of Integrity Check Value"
description: "The default BKS keystore use an HMAC that is only 16 bits long, which
  can allow an attacker to compromise the integrity of a BKS keystore. Bouncy Castle
  release 1.47 changes the BKS format to a format which uses a 160 bit HMAC instead.
  This applies to any BKS keystore generated prior to BC 1.47. For situations where
  people need to create the files for legacy reasons a specific keystore type \"BKS-V1\"
  was introduced in 1.49. It should be noted that the use of \"BKS-V1\" is discouraged
  by the library authors and should only be used where it is otherwise safe to do
  so, as in where the use of a 16 bit checksum for the file integrity check is not
  going to cause a security issue in itself."
