package_slug: "maven/org.bouncycastle/bcprov-jdk16"
title: "Observable Discrepancy"
description: "In Legion of the Bouncy Castle BC before 1.61 and BC-FJA before 1.0.1.2,
  attackers can obtain sensitive information about a private exponent because of Observable
  Differences in Behavior to Error Inputs. This occurs in org.bouncycastle.crypto.encodings.OAEPEncoding.
  Sending invalid ciphertext that decrypts to a short payload in the OAEP Decoder
  could result in the throwing of an early exception, potentially leaking some information
  about the private exponent of the RSA private key performing the encryption."
