package_slug: "maven/org.bouncycastle/bcprov-jdk14"
title: "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature"
description: "In Bouncy Castle JCE Provider version 1.55 and earlier the DSA does
  not fully validate ASN.1 encoding of signature on verification. It is possible to
  inject extra elements in the sequence making up the signature and still have it
  validate, which in some cases may allow the introduction of 'invisible' data into
  a signed structure."
