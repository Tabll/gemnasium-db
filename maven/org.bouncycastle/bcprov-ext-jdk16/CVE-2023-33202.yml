description: "Bouncy Castle for Java before 1.73 contains a potential Denial of Service
  (DoS) issue within the Bouncy Castle org.bouncycastle.openssl.PEMParser class. This
  class parses OpenSSL PEM encoded streams containing X.509 certificates, PKCS8 encoded
  keys, and PKCS7 objects. Parsing a file that has crafted ASN.1 data through the
  PEMParser causes an OutOfMemoryError, which can enable a denial of service attack."
