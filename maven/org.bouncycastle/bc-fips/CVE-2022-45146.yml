title: "Garbage collection issue in BC-FJA in Java 13 and later"
description: "An issue was discovered in the FIPS Java API of Bouncy Castle BC-FJA
  before 1.0.2.4. Changes to the JVM garbage collector in Java 13 and later trigger
  an issue in the BC-FJA FIPS modules where it is possible for temporary keys used
  by the module to be zeroed out while still in use by the module, resulting in errors
  or potential information loss. NOTE: FIPS compliant users are unaffected because
  the FIPS certification is only for Java 7, 8, and 11."
