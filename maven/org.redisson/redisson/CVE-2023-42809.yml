title: "Redisson vulnerable to Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "Redisson is a Java Redis client that uses the Netty framework. Prior
  to version 3.22.0, some of the messages received from the Redis server contain Java
  objects that the client deserializes without further validation. Attackers that
  manage to trick clients into communicating with a malicious server can include especially
  crafted objects in its responses that, once deserialized by the client, force it
  to execute arbitrary code. This can be abused to take control of the machine the
  client is running in. Version 3.22.0 contains a patch for this issue.\n\nSome post-fix
  advice is available. Do NOT use `Kryo5Codec` as deserialization codec, as it is
  still vulnerable to arbitrary object deserialization due to the `setRegistrationRequired(false)`
  call. On the contrary, `KryoCodec` is safe to use. The fix applied to `SerializationCodec`
  only consists of adding an optional allowlist of class names, even though making
  this behavior the default is recommended. When instantiating `SerializationCodec`
  please use the `SerializationCodec(ClassLoader classLoader, Set<String> allowedClasses)`
  constructor to restrict the allowed classes for deserialization."
