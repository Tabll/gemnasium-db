title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "A flaw was found in jboss-remoting in versions before 5.0.20.SP1-redhat-00001.
  A malicious attacker could cause threads to hold up forever in the EJB server by
  writing a sequence of bytes corresponding to the expected messages of a successful
  EJB client request, but omitting the ACK messages, or just tamper with jboss-remoting
  code, deleting the lines that send the ACK message from the EJB client code resulting
  in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system
  availability."
