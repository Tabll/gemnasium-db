identifier: "CVE-2020-27220"
package_slug: "maven/org.eclipse.vorto/hono"
title: "Missing Authorization"
description: "The Eclipse Hono AMQP and MQTT protocol adapters do not check whether
  an authenticated gateway device is authorized to receive command & control messages
  when it has subscribed only to commands for a specific device. The missing check
  involves verifying that the command target device is configured giving permission
  for the gateway device to act on its behalf. This means an authenticated device
  of a certain tenant, notably also a non-gateway device acting like a gateway, may
  receive command & control messages targeted at a different device of the same tenant
  without corresponding permissions getting checked."
