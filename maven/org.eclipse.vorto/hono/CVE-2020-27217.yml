identifier: "CVE-2020-27217"
package_slug: "maven/org.eclipse.vorto/hono"
title: "Buffer Overflow"
description: "In Eclipse Hono the AMQP protocol adapter does not verify the size of
  AMQP messages received from devices. In particular, a device may send messages that
  are bigger than the max-message-size that the protocol adapter has indicated during
  link establishment. While the AMQP protocol explicitly disallows a peer to send
  such messages, a hand crafted AMQP client could exploit this behavior in order to
  send a message of unlimited size to the adapter, eventually causing the adapter
  to fail with an out of memory exception."
