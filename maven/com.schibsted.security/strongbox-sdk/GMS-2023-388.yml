title: "Privilege escalation in Strongbox"
description: "An attacker with read-only access to a Strongbox secret could 
  craft a valid encrypted secret (same id/version). It also makes the audit 
  logs from KMS less useful. The issue is caused by a bug in the underlying 
  AWS Encryption SDK.
  By default, the encrypted secrets are stored in DynamoDB and an attacker 
  with read-only access would not be able to write the encrypted secret to 
  DynamoDB. So in practice the impact should be limited for most users.
  Strongbox supports storing data in files as an alternative to DynamoDB. 
  If the attacker had write access to where the files are stored they could 
  make the attack work end-to-end. Similarly, any custom storage backend 
  could also be affected.
  In order to be backwards compatible Strongbox will not make use of key 
  commitments (another improvement to the AWS Encryption SDK). Strongbox 
  enforces that only one KMS key can be used, and it must match the expected 
  one. This means that an attacker needs write access to both KMS and 
  DynamoDB (or other storage backend) to stage an attack, which is not 
  a scenario Strongbox is designed to protect against."
