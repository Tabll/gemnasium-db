package_slug: "maven/org.dependencytrack/dependency-track"
title: "Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information"
description: "Dependency-Track is a Component Analysis platform that allows organizations
  to identify and reduce risk in the software supply chain. Prior to version 4.6.0,
  performing an API request using a valid API key with insufficient permissions causes
  the API key to be written to Dependency-Track's audit log in clear text. Actors
  with access to the audit log can exploit this flaw to gain access to valid API keys.
  The issue has been fixed in Dependency-Track 4.6.0. Instead of logging the entire
  API key, only the last 4 characters of the key will be logged. It is strongly recommended
  to check historic logs for occurrences of this behavior, and re-generating API keys
  in case of leakage."
