title: "Apache StreamPark: Use the user’s password as the secret key Vulnerability"
description: "When encrypting sensitive data, weak encryption keys that are fixed
  or directly generated based on user passwords are used. Attackers can obtain these
  keys through methods such as reverse engineering, code leaks, or password guessing,
  thereby decrypting stored or transmitted encrypted data, leading to the leakage
  of sensitive information.\n\nThis issue affects Apache StreamPark: from 2.0.0 before
  2.1.7.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 2.1.7, which fixes the issue."
