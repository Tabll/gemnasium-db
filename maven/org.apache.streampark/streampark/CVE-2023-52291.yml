title: "Apache StreamPark: Unchecked maven build params could trigger remote command
  execution"
description: "In streampark, the project module integrates Maven's compilation capabilities.
  The input parameter validation is not strict, allowing attackers to insert commands
  for remote command execution, The prerequisite for a successful attack is that the
  user needs to log in to the streampark system and have system-level permissions.
  Generally, only users of that system have the authorization to log in, and users
  would not manually input a dangerous operation command. Therefore, the risk level
  of this vulnerability is very low.\n\nBackground:\n\nIn the \"Project\" module,
  the maven build args  “<” operator causes command injection. e.g : “< (curl  http://xxx.com
  )” will be executed as a command injection,\n\nMitigation:\n\nall users should upgrade
  to 2.1.4,  The \"<\" operator will blocked。"
