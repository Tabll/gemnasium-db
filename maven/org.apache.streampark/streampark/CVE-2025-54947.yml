title: "Apache StreamPark has a hard-coded encryption key"
description: "In Apache StreamPark versions 2.0.0 through 2.1.7, a security vulnerability
  involving a hard-coded encryption key exists. This vulnerability occurs because
  the system uses a fixed, immutable key for encryption instead of dynamically generating
  or securely configuring the key. Attackers may obtain this key through reverse engineering
  or code analysis, potentially decrypting sensitive data or forging encrypted information,
  leading to information disclosure or unauthorized system access.\n\nThis issue affects
  Apache StreamPark: from 2.0.0 before 2.1.7.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade
  to version 2.1.7, which fixes the issue."
