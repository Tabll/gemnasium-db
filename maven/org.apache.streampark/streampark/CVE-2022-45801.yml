title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream
  Component ('Injection')"
description: "Apache StreamPark 1.0.0 to 2.0.0 have a LDAP injection vulnerability.\nLDAP
  Injection is an attack used to exploit web based applications\nthat construct LDAP
  statements based on user input. When an\napplication fails to properly sanitize
  user input, it's possible to\nmodify LDAP statements through techniques similar
  to SQL Injection.\nLDAP injection attacks could result in the granting of permissions
  to\nunauthorized queries, and content modification inside the LDAP tree.\nThis risk
  may only occur when the user logs in with ldap, and the user\nname and password
  login will not be affected, Users of the affected\nversions should upgrade to Apache
  StreamPark 2.0.0 or later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
