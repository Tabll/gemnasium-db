package_slug: "maven/com.haulmont.addon.restapi/restapi-rest-api"
title: "XSS in the /files Endpoint of the Generic REST API"
description: "The input parameter, which consists of a file path and name, can be
  manipulated to return the Content-Type header with text/html if the name part ends
  with .html. This could allow malicious JavaScript code to be executed in the browser.
  For a successful attack, a malicious file needs to be uploaded beforehand.\n\nThe
  severity of the vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the application UI and
  the generic REST API are typically accessible only to authenticated users."
