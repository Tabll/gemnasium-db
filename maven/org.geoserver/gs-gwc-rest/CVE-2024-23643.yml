title: "GeoServer's GWC Seed Form vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
description: "A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists that enables
  an authenticated administrator with workspace-level privileges to store a JavaScript
  payload in the GeoServer catalog that will execute in the context of another administratorâ€™s
  browser when viewed in the GWC Seed Form.  Access to the GWC Seed Form is limited
  to full administrators by default and granting non-administrators access to this
  endpoint is not recommended."
