title: "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in GeoServer's REST Resources
  API"
description: "A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists that enables
  an authenticated administrator with workspace-level privileges to store a JavaScript
  payload in uploaded style/legend resources that will execute in the context of another
  administrator's browser when viewed in the REST Resources API.  Access to the REST
  Resources API is limited to full administrators by default and granting non-administrators
  access to this endpoint should be carefully considered as it may allow access to
  files containing sensitive information."
