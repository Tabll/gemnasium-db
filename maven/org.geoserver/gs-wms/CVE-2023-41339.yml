package_slug: "maven/org.geoserver/gs-wms"
title: "Unsecured WMS dynamic styling sld=<url> parameter affords blind unauthenticated
  SSRF"
description: "### Summary\n\nThe WMS specification defines an ``sld=<url>`` parameter
  for GetMap, GetLegendGraphic and GetFeatureInfo operations for user supplied \"dynamic
  styling\". Enabling the use of dynamic styles, without also configuring URL checks,
  provides the opportunity for Service Side Request Forgery.\n \nIt is possible to
  use this for \"Blind SSRF\" on the WMS endpoint to steal NetNTLMv2 hashes via file
  requests to malicious servers.\n\n### Details\n\nThis vulnerability requires:\n\n*
  WMS Settings dynamic styling being enabled\n* Security URL checks to be disabled,
  or to be enabled and allowing ``file:\\\\*`` access\n\n### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability
  can be used to steal user NetNTLMv2 hashes which could be relayed or cracked externally
  to gain further access.\n\n### Mitigation\n\nThe ability to reference an external
  URL location is defined by the WMS standard GetMap, GetFeatureInfo and GetLegendGraphic
  operations. These operations are defined by an Industry and International standard
  and cannot be redefined by the GeoServer application in isolation.\n\nTo disable
  dynamic styling on GeoServer 2.10.3 and GeoServer 2.11.1:\n\n1. Navigate to **Services
  > WMS Settings** page\n2. Locate **Dynamic styling** heading\n3. Select the **Disable
  usage of SLD and SLD_BODY parameters in GET requests and user styles in POST** checkbox.\n\n###
  Resolution\n\nTo allow dynamic styling safely on GeoServer 2.22.5 and GeoServer
  2.23.2:\n\n1. Navigate to **Security > URL Checks**\n2. Enable **URL Checks are
  enabled** setting\n3. Check the user manual for [examples](https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/security/urlchecks.html#example-regex-patterns)
  of how to trust specific locations:\n  ``^https://styles\\.server\\.net/cartography/.*$``\n4.
  Enable dynamic styling on the **Services > WMS Settings** page, deselect the **Disable
  usage of SLD and SLD_BODY parameters in GET requests and user styles in POST** checkbox.\n\nUse
  of dynamic styling safely is on by default in GeoServer 2.24.0.\n\n### References\n\n*
