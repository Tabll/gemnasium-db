title: "GeoServer's Simple SVG Renderer vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  (XSS)"
description: "A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists that enables
  an authenticated administrator with workspace-level privileges to store a JavaScript
  payload in the GeoServer catalog that will execute in the context of another user's
  browser when viewed in the WMS GetMap SVG Output Format when the Simple SVG renderer
  is enabled.  Access to the WMS SVG Format is available to all users by default although
  data and service security may limit users' ability to trigger the XSS."
