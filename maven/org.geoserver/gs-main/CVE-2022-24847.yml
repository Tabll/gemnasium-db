package_slug: "maven/org.geoserver/gs-main"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "GeoServer is an open source software server written in Java that allows
  users to share and edit geospatial data. The GeoServer security mechanism can perform
  an unchecked JNDI lookup, which in turn can be used to perform class deserialization
  and result in arbitrary code execution. The same can happen while configuring data
  stores with data sources located in JNDI, or while setting up the disk quota mechanism.
  In order to perform any of the above changes, the attack needs to have obtained
  admin rights and use either the GeoServer GUI, or its REST API. The lookups are
  going to be restricted in GeoServer 2.21.0, 2.20.4, 1.19.6. Users unable to upgrade
  should restrict access to the `geoserver/web` and `geoserver/rest` via a firewall
  and ensure that the GeoWebCache is not remotely accessible."
