package_slug: "maven/com.alipay.sofa/hessian"
title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "** DISPUTED ** SOFA-Hessian through 4.0.2 allows remote attackers to
  execute arbitrary commands via a crafted serialized Hessian object because denylisting
  of com.caucho.naming.QName and com.sun.org.apache.xpath.internal.objects.XString
  is mishandled, related to Resin Gadget. NOTE: The vendor doesnâ€™t consider this issue
  a vulnerability because the denylist is being misused. SOFA Hessian supports custom
  denylist and a disclaimer was posted encouraging users to update the denylist
  or to use the allowlist feature for their specific needs since the denylist is
  not being actively updated."
