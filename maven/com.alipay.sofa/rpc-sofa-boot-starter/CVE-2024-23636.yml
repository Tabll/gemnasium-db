title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "SOFARPC is a Java RPC framework. SOFARPC defaults to using the SOFA
  Hessian protocol to deserialize received data, while the SOFA Hessian protocol uses
  a block list mechanism to restrict deserialization of potentially dangerous classes
  for security protection. But, prior to version 5.12.0, there is a gadget chain that
  can bypass the SOFA Hessian block list protection mechanism, and this gadget chain
  only relies on JDK and does not rely on any third-party components. Version 5.12.0
  fixed this issue by adding a block list. SOFARPC also provides a way to add additional
  block lists. Users can add a class like `-Drpc_serialize_block list_override=org.apache.xpath.`
  to avoid this issue."
