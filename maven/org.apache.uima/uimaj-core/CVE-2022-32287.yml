title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "A relative path traversal vulnerability in a FileUtil class used by
  the PEAR management component of Apache UIMA allows an attacker to create files
  outside the designated target directory using carefully crafted ZIP entry names.
  This issue affects Apache UIMA Apache UIMA version 3.3.0 and prior versions. Note
  that PEAR files should never be installed into an UIMA installation from untrusted
  sources because PEAR archives are executable plugins that will be able to perform
  any actions with the same privileges as the host Java Virtual Machine."
