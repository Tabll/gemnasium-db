package_slug: "maven/org.apache.nifi/nifi-dbcp-service"
title: "Apache NiFi Code Injection vulnerability"
description: "Apache NiFi 0.0.2 through 1.22.0 include Processors and Controller Services
  that support HTTP URL references for retrieving drivers, which allows an authenticated
  and authorized user to configure a location that enables custom code execution.
  The resolution introduces a new Required Permission for referencing remote resources,
  restricting configuration of these components to privileged users. The permission
  prevents unprivileged users from configuring Processors and Controller Services
  annotated with the new Reference Remote Resources restriction. Upgrading to Apache
  NiFi 1.23.0 is the recommended mitigation."
