title: "Apache NiFi GetAsanaObject Processor has Remote Code Execution via Unsafe
  Deserialization"
description: "Apache NiFi 1.20.0 through 2.6.0 include the GetAsanaObject Processor,
  which requires integration with a configurable Distribute Map Cache Client Service
  for storing and retrieving state information. The GetAsanaObject Processor used
  generic Java Object serialization and deserialization without filtering. Unfiltered
  Java object deserialization does not provide protection against crafted state information
  stored in the cache server configured for GetAsanaObject. Exploitation requires
  an Apache NiFi system running with the GetAsanaObject Processor, and direct access
  to the configured cache server. Upgrading to Apache NiFi 2.7.0 is the recommended
  mitigation, which replaces Java Object serialization with JSON serialization. Removing
  the GetAsanaObject Processor located in the nifi-asana-processors-nar bundle also
  prevents exploitation."
