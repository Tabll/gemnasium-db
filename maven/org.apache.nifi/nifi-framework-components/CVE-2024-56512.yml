title: "Apache NiFi: Missing Complete Authorization for Parameter and Service References"
description: "Apache NiFi 1.10.0 through 2.0.0 are missing fine-grained authorization
  checking for Parameter Contexts, referenced Controller Services, and referenced
  Parameter Providers, when creating new Process Groups.\n\nCreating a new Process
  Group can include binding to a Parameter Context, but in cases where the Process
  Group did not reference any Parameter values, the framework did not check user authorization
  for the bound Parameter Context. Missing authorization for a bound Parameter Context
  enabled clients to download non-sensitive Parameter values after creating the Process
  Group.\n\nCreating a new Process Group can also include referencing existing Controller
  Services or Parameter Providers. The framework did not check user authorization
  for referenced Controller Services or Parameter Providers, enabling clients to create
  Process Groups and use these components that were otherwise unauthorized.\n\nThis
  vulnerability is limited in scope to authenticated users authorized to create Process
  Groups. The scope is further limited to deployments with component-based authorization
  policies. Upgrading to Apache NiFi 2.1.0 is the recommended mitigation, which includes
  authorization checking for Parameter and Controller Service references on Process
  Group creation."
