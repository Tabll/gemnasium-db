title: "Apache NiFi: Missing Authorization of Restricted Permissions for Component
  Updates"
description: "Apache NiFi 1.1.0 through 2.7.2 are missing authorization when updating
  configuration properties on extension components that have specific Required Permissions
  based on the Restricted annotation. The Restricted annotation indicates additional
  privileges required to add the annotated component to the flow configuration, but
  framework authorization did not check restricted status when updating a component
  previously added. The missing authorization requires a more privileged user to add
  a restricted component to the flow configuration, but permits a less privileged
  user to make property configuration changes. Apache NiFi installations that do not
  implement different levels of authorization for Restricted components are not subject
  to this vulnerability because the framework enforces write permissions as the security
  boundary. Upgrading to Apache NiFi 2.8.0 is the recommended mitigation."
