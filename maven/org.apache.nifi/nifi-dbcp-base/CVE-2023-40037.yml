package_slug: "maven/org.apache.nifi/nifi-dbcp-base"
title: "Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs"
description: "Apache NiFi 1.21.0 through 1.23.0 support JDBC and JNDI JMS access in
  several Processors and Controller Services with connection URL validation that does
  not provide sufficient protection against crafted inputs. An authenticated and authorized
  user can bypass connection URL validation using custom input formatting. The resolution
  enhances connection URL validation and introduces validation for additional related
  properties. Upgrading to Apache NiFi 1.23.1 is the recommended mitigation.\n"
