title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "Apache NiFi 0.7.0 through 1.23.2 include the JoltTransformJSON Processor,
  which provides an advanced configuration user interface that is vulnerable to DOM-based
  cross-site scripting. If an authenticated user, who is authorized to configure a
  JoltTransformJSON Processor, visits a crafted URL, then arbitrary\nJavaScript code
  can be executed within the session context of the authenticated user. Upgrading
  to Apache NiFi 1.24.0 or 2.0.0-M1 is the recommended mitigation."
