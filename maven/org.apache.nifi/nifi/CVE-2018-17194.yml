title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "When a client request to a cluster node was replicated to other nodes
  in the cluster for verification, the `Content-Length` was forwarded. On a `DELETE`
  request, the body was ignored, but if the initial request had a `Content-Length`
  value other than `0`, the receiving nodes would wait for the body and eventually
  timeout."
