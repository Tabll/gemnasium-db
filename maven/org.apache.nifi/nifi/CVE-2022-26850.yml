identifiers:
- "CVE-2022-26850"
package_slug: "maven/org.apache.nifi/nifi"
title: "Insufficiently Protected Credentials"
description: "When creating or updating credentials for single-user access, Apache
  NiFi wrote a copy of the Login Identity Providers configuration to the operating
  system temporary directory. On most platforms, the operating system temporary directory
  has global read permissions. NiFi immediately moved the temporary file to the final
  configuration directory, which significantly limited the window of opportunity for
  access. NiFi 1.16.0 includes updates to replace the Login Identity Providers configuration
  without writing a file to the operating system temporary directory."
