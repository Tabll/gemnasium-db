description: "The JndiJmsConnectionFactoryProvider Controller Service, along with
  the ConsumeJMS and PublishJMS Processors, in Apache NiFi 1.8.0 through 1.21.0 allow
  an authenticated and authorized user to configure URL and library properties that
  enable deserialization of untrusted data from a remote location.\n\nThe resolution
