title: "Apache NiFi: Potential Insertion of MongoDB Password in Provenance Record"
description: "Apache NiFi 1.13.0 through 2.2.0 includes the username and password
  used to authenticate with MongoDB in the NiFi provenance events that MongoDB components
  generate during processing. An authorized user with read access to the provenance
  events of those processors may see the credentials information. Upgrading to Apache
  NiFi 2.3.0 is the recommended mitigation, which removes the credentials from provenance
  event records."
