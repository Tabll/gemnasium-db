title: "Jenkins OctoPerf Load Testing Plugin missing permission check allows for unauthorized
  server connections"
description: "Jenkins OctoPerf Load Testing Plugin Plugin 4.5.2 and earlier does not
  perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.\n\nThis allows attackers with
  Overall/Read permission to connect to a previously configured Octoperf server using
  attacker-specified credentials.\n\nAdditionally, these endpoints do not require
  POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.\n\nOctoPerf
  Load Testing Plugin Plugin 4.5.3 requires POST requests and the appropriate permissions
  for the affected HTTP endpoints."
