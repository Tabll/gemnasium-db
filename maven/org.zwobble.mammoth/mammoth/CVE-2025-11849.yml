title: "Mammoth is vulnerable to Directory Traversal"
description: "Versions of the package mammoth from 0.3.25 and before 1.11.0; versions
  of the package mammoth from 0.3.25 and before 1.11.0; versions of the package mammoth
  before 1.11.0; versions of the package org.zwobble.mammoth:mammoth before 1.11.0
  are vulnerable to Directory Traversal due to the lack of path or file type validation
  when processing a docx file containing an image with an external link (r:link attribute
  instead of embedded r:embed). The library resolves the URI to a file path and after
  reading, the content is encoded as base64 and included in the HTML output as a data
  URI. An attacker can read arbitrary files on the system where the conversion is
  performed or cause an excessive resources consumption by crafting a docx file that
  links to special device files such as /dev/random or /dev/zero."
