package_slug: "maven/org.apache.qpid/apache-qpid-broker-j"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "A Denial of Service vulnerability was found in Apache Qpid Broker-J
  7.0.0 in functionality for authentication of connections for AMQP protocols 0-8,
  0-9, 0-91 and 0-10 when PLAIN or XOAUTH2 SASL mechanism is used. The vulnerability
  allows unauthenticated attacker to crash the broker instance. AMQP 1.0 and HTTP
  connections are not affected. An authentication of incoming AMQP connections in
  Apache Qpid Broker-J is performed by special entities called \"Authentication Providers\".
  Each Authentication Provider can support several SASL mechanisms which are offered
  to the connecting clients as part of SASL negotiation process. The client chooses
  the most appropriate SASL mechanism for authentication. Authentication Providers
  of following types supports PLAIN SASL mechanism: Plain, PlainPasswordFile, SimpleLDAP,
  Base64MD5PasswordFile, MD5, SCRAM-SHA-256, SCRAM-SHA-1. XOAUTH2 SASL mechanism is
  supported by Authentication Providers of type OAuth2. If an AMQP port is configured
  with any of these Authentication Providers, the Broker may be vulnerable."
