identifier: "CVE-2019-0223"
package_slug: "maven/org.apache.qpid/proton-j"
title: "Improper Certificate Validation"
description: "Under some circumstances Apache Qpid Proton versions (C library and
  its language bindings) can connect to a peer anonymously using TLS even when configured
  to verify the peer certificate while used with OpenSSL versions before 1.1.0. This
  means that an undetected man in the middle attack could be constructed if an attacker
  can arrange to intercept TLS traffic."
