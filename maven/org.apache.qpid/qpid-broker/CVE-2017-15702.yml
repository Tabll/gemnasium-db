title: "Moderate severity vulnerability that affects org.apache.qpid:qpid-broker"
description: "In Apache Qpid Broker-J 0.18 through 0.32, if the broker is configured
  with different authentication providers on different ports one of which is an HTTP
  port, then the broker can be tricked by a remote unauthenticated attacker connecting
  to the HTTP port into using an authentication provider that was configured on a
  different port. The attacker still needs valid credentials with the authentication
  provider on the spoofed port. This becomes an issue when the spoofed port has weaker
  authentication protection (e.g., anonymous access, default accounts) and is normally
  protected by firewall rules or similar which can be circumvented by this vulnerability.
  AMQP ports are not affected. Versions 6.0.0 and newer are not affected."
