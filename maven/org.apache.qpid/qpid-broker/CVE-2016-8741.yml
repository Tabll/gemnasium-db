package_slug: "maven/org.apache.qpid/qpid-broker"
title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "The Apache Qpid Broker for Java can be configured to use different so
  called AuthenticationProviders to handle user authentication. Among the choices
  are the SCRAM-SHA-1 and SCRAM-SHA-256 AuthenticationProvider types. It was discovered
  that these AuthenticationProviders in Apache Qpid Broker for Java 6.0.x before 6.0.6
  and 6.1.x before 6.1.1 prematurely terminate the SCRAM SASL negotiation if the provided
  user name does not exist thus allowing remote attacker to determine the existence
  of user accounts. The Vulnerability does not apply to AuthenticationProviders other
  than SCRAM-SHA-1 and SCRAM-SHA-256."
