title: "Sakai kernel-impl: predictable PRNG used to generate server‑side encryption
  key in EncryptionUtilityServiceImpl"
description: "EncryptionUtilityServiceImpl initialized an AES256TextEncryptor password
  (serverSecretKey) using RandomStringUtils with the default java.util.Random. java.util.Random
  is a non‑cryptographic PRNG and can be predicted from limited state/seed information
  (e.g., start time window), substantially reducing the effective search space of
  the generated key. An attacker who can obtain ciphertexts (e.g., exported or at‑rest
  strings protected by this service) and approximate the PRNG seed can feasibly reconstruct
  the serverSecretKey and decrypt affected data."
