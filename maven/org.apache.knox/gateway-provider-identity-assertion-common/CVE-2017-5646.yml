title: "Apache Knox allows impersonation of users"
description: "For versions of Apache Knox from 0.2.0 to 0.11.0 - an authenticated
  user may use a specially crafted URL to impersonate another user while accessing
  WebHDFS through Apache Knox. This may result in escalated privileges and unauthorized
  data access. While this activity is audit logged and can be easily associated with
  the authenticated user, this is still a serious security issue. All users are recommended
  to upgrade to the Apache Knox 0.12.0 release."
