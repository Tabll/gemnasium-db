title: "com.enonic.xp:lib-auth vulnerable to Session Fixation"
description: "### Impact\nAll id-providers using lib-auth `login` method. lib-auth
  should invalidate old session after login and replicate session attributes in a
  new one, however this is not the behavior in affected versions.\n\n### Workarounds\nDon't
  use lib-auth for `login`. \nJava API uses low-level structures and allows to invalidate
  previous session before auth-info is added.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://github.com/enonic/xp/issues/9253"
