identifier: "CVE-2017-1000386"
package_slug: "maven/org.biouno/uno-choice"
title: "Cross-site Scripting"
description: "Jenkins Active Choices plugin allowed users with \"Job/Configure\" permission
  to provide arbitrary HTML to be shown on the \"Build With Parameters\" page through
  the \"Active Choices Reactive Reference Parameter\" type. This could include, for
  example, arbitrary JavaScript. Active Choices now sanitizes the HTML inserted on
  the \"Build With Parameters\" page if and only if the script is executed in a sandbox.
  As unsandboxed scripts are subject to administrator approval, it is up to the administrator
  to allow or disallow problematic script output."
