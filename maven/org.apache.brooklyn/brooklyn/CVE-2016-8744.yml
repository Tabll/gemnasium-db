identifier: "CVE-2016-8744"
package_slug: "maven/org.apache.brooklyn/brooklyn"
title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "Apache Brooklyn uses the SnakeYAML library for parsing YAML inputs.
  SnakeYAML allows the use of YAML tags to indicate that SnakeYAML should unmarshal
  data to a Java type. In the default configuration in Brooklyn, SnakeYAML will allow
  unmarshalling to any Java type available on the classpath. This could provide an
  authenticated user with a means to cause the JVM running Brooklyn to load and run
  Java code without detection by Brooklyn. Such code would have the privileges of
  the Java process running Brooklyn, including the ability to open files and network
  connections, and execute system commands."
