title: "Improper Neutralization"
description: "GeoTools is an open source Java library that provides tools for geospatial
  data. GeoTools includes support for OGC Filter expression language parsing, encoding
  and execution against a range of datastore. SQL Injection Vulnerabilities have been
  found when executing OGC Filters with JDBCDataStore implementations. Users are advised
  to upgrade to either version 27.4 or to 28.2 to resolve this issue. Users unable
  to upgrade may disable `encode functions` for PostGIS DataStores or enable `prepared
  statements` for JDBCDataStores as a partial mitigation."
