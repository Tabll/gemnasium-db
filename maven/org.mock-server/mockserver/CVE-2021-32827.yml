package_slug: "maven/org.mock-server/mockserver"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream
  Component ('Injection')"
description: "MockServer is open source software which enables easy mocking of any
  system you integrate with via HTTP or HTTPS. An attacker that can trick a victim
  into visiting a malicious site while running MockServer locally, will be able to
  run arbitrary code on the MockServer machine. With an overly broad default CORS
  configuration MockServer allows any site to send cross-site requests. Additionally,
  MockServer allows you to create dynamic expectations using Javascript or Velocity
  templates. Both engines may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on-behalf
  of MockServer. By combining these two issues (Overly broad CORS configuration +
  Script injection), an attacker could serve a malicious page so that if a developer
  running MockServer visits it, they will get compromised. For more details including
  a PoC see the referenced GHSL-2021-059."
