title: "QOS.CH logback-core Expression Language Injection vulnerability"
description: "ACE vulnerability in JaninoEventEvaluator by QOS.CH logback-core up
  to and including version 1.5.12 in Java applications allows attackers to execute
  arbitrary code by compromising an existing logback configuration file or by injecting
  an environment variable before program execution.\n\nMalicious logback configuration
  files can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code using the JaninoEventEvaluator
  extension.\n\nA successful attack requires the user to have write access to a configuration
  file. Alternatively, the attacker could inject a malicious environment variable
  pointing to a malicious configuration file. In both cases, the attack requires existing
  privilege."
