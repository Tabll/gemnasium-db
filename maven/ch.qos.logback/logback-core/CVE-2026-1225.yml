title: "Logback allows an attacker to instantiate classes already present on the class
  path"
description: "ACE vulnerability in configuration file processing  by QOS.CH logback-core
  up to and including version 1.5.24 in Java applications, allows an attacker to instantiate
  classes already present on the class path by compromising an existing logback configuration
  file.\n\nThe instantiation of a potentially malicious Java class requires that said
  class is present on the user's class-path. In addition, the attacker must  have
  write access to a configuration file. However, after successful instantiation, the
  instance is very likely to be discarded with no further ado."
