title: "QOS.CH logback-core is vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution through file
  processing"
description: "QOS.CH logback-core versions up to 1.5.18 contain an ACE vulnerability
  in conditional configuration file processing in Java applications. This vulnerability
  allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code by compromising an existing logback
  configuration file or by injecting a malicious environment variable before program
  execution.\n\nA successful attack requires the Janino library and Spring Framework
  to be present on the user's class path. Additionally, the attacker must have write
  access to a configuration file. Alternatively, the attacker could inject a malicious
  environment variable pointing to a malicious configuration file. In both cases,
  the attack requires existing privileges."
