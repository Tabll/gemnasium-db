title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "DSpace open source software is a repository application which provides
  durable access to digital resources. In affected versions the ItemImportServiceImpl
  is vulnerable to a path traversal vulnerability. This means a malicious SAF (simple
  archive format) package could cause a file/directory to be created anywhere the
  Tomcat/DSpace user can write to on the server. However, this path traversal vulnerability
  is only possible by a user with special privileges (either Administrators or someone
  with command-line access to the server). This vulnerability impacts the XMLUI, JSPUI
  and command-line. Users are advised to upgrade. As a basic workaround, users may
  block all access to the following URL paths: If you are using the XMLUI, block all
  access to /admin/batchimport path (this is the URL of the Admin Batch Import tool).
  Keep in mind, if your site uses the path \"/xmlui\", then you'd need to block access
  to /xmlui/admin/batchimport. If you are using the JSPUI, block all access to /dspace-admin/batchimport
  path (this is the URL of the Admin Batch Import tool). Keep in mind, if your site
  uses the path \"/jspui\", then you'd need to block access to /jspui/dspace-admin/batchimport.
  Keep in mind, only an Administrative user or a user with command-line access to
  the server is able to import/upload SAF packages. Therefore, assuming those users
  do not blindly upload untrusted SAF packages, then it is unlikely your site could
  be impacted by this vulnerability."
