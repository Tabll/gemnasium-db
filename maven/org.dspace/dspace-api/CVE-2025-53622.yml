title: "DSpace is vulnerable to Path Traversal attacks when importing packages using
  Simple Archive Format"
description: "A path traversal vulnerability is possible during the import of an archive
  (in [Simple Archive Format](https://wiki.lyrasis.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=104566653)),
  either from command-line (`./dspace import` command) or from the \"Batch Import
  (Zip)\" user interface feature.  _This vulnerability likely impacts all versions
  of DSpace 1.x <= 7.6.3, 8.0 <= 8.1, and 9.0_.\n\nAn attacker may craft a malicious
  Simple Archive Format (SAF) package where the `contents` file references any system
  files (using relative traversal sequences) which are readable by the Tomcat user.
  \ If such a package is imported, this will result in sensitive content disclose,
  including retrieving arbitrary files or configurations from the server where DSpace
  is running.\n\n**The Simple Archive Format (SAF) importer / Batch Import (Zip) is
  only usable by site administrators** (from user interface / REST API) or system
  administrators (from command-line).  Therefore, to exploit this vulnerability, the
  malicious payload would have to be provided by an attacker and trusted by an administrator
  (who would trigger the import).\n* **The most severe practical impact** is a case
  where an attacker obtains DSpace administrator credentials and uses the Batch Import
  feature with a malicious SAF archive to expose sensitive local files readable by
  the Tomcat user.\n* An attacker without administrative credentials might use some
  other tactic to convince an administrator to import a malicious SAF archive they
  have supplied."
