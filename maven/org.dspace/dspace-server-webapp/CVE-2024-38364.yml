package_slug: "maven/org.dspace/dspace-server-webapp"
title: "DSpace Cross Site Scripting (XSS) via a deposited HTML/XML document"
description: "In DSpace 7.0 through 7.6.1, when an HTML, XML or JavaScript Bitstream
  is downloaded, the user's browser _may_ execute any embedded JavaScript.  If that
  embedded JavaScript is malicious, there is a risk of an XSS attack.\n\nThis attack
  may only be initialized by a user who already has Submitter privileges in the repository.
  The submitter must upload the malicious HTML/XML/JavaScript file themselves. The
  attack itself would not occur until a different authenticated user downloads the
  malicious file.  CORS and CSRF protection built into DSpace help to limit the impact
  of the attack (and may block it in some scenarios).\n\nIf the repository is configured
  to only download HTML / XML / JavaScript Bitstreams using the [`Content-Disposition:
  attachment`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Disposition)
  header, then the attack is no longer possible.  See \"Workarounds\" below."
