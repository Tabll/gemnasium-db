package_slug: "maven/org.dspace/dspace-jspui"
title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "DSpace open source software is a repository application which provides
  durable access to digital resources. dspace-jspui is a UI component for DSpace.
  The JSPUI resumable upload implementations in SubmissionController and FileUploadRequest
  is vulnerable to multiple path traversal attacks, allowing an attacker to create
  files/directories anywhere on the server writable by the Tomcat/DSpace user, by
  modifying some request parameters during submission. This path traversal can only
  be executed by a user with special privileges (submitter rights). This vulnerability
  only impacts the JSPUI. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds.
  However, this vulnerability cannot be exploited by an anonymous user or a basic
  user. The user must first have submitter privileges to at least one Collection and
  be able to determine how to modify the request parameters to exploit the vulnerability."
