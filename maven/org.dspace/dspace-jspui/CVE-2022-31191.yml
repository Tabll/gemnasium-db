title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "DSpace open source software is a repository application which provides
  durable access to digital resources. dspace-jspui is a UI component for DSpace.
  The JSPUI spellcheck \"Did you mean\" HTML escapes the data-spell attribute in the
  link, but not the actual displayed text. Similarly, the JSPUI autocomplete HTML
  does not properly escape text passed to it. Both is vulnerable to XSS. This vulnerability
  only impacts the JSPUI. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
  for this issue."
