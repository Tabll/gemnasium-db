title: "URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')"
description: "DSpace open source software is a repository application which provides
  durable access to digital resources. dspace-jspui is a UI component for DSpace.
  The JSPUI controlled vocabulary servlet is vulnerable to an open redirect attack,
  where an attacker can craft a malicious URL that looks like a legitimate DSpace/repository
  URL. When that URL is clicked by the target, it redirects them to a site of the
  attacker's choice. This issue has been patched in versions 5.11 and 6.4. Users are
  advised to upgrade. There are no known workaround for this vulnerability."
