title: "Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference"
description: "XXE injection in /rtc/post/ endpoint in OpenMNS Horizon 31.0.8 and versions
  earlier than 32.0.2 on multiple platforms is vulnerable to XML external entity (XXE)
  injection, which can be used for instance to force Horizon to make arbitrary HTTP
  requests to internal and external services. The solution is to upgrade to Meridian
  2023.1.6, 2022.1.19, 2021.1.30, 2020.1.38 or Horizon 32.0.2 or newer. Meridian and
  Horizon installation instructions state that they are intended for installation
  within an organization's private networks and should not be directly accessible
  from the Internet. OpenNMS thanks Erik Wynter and Moshe Apelbaum for reporting this
  issue.\n"
