package_slug: "maven/com.google.oauth-client/google-oauth-client"
title: "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature"
description: "The vulnerability is that IDToken verifier does not verify if token
  is properly signed. Signature verification makes sure that the token's payload comes
  from valid provider, not from someone else. An attacker can provide a compromised
  token with custom payload. The token will pass the validation on the client side.
  We recommend upgrading to version 1.33.3 or above"
