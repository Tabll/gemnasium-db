title: "Incorrect Authorization"
description: "CometD is a scalable comet implementation for web messaging. In any
  version prior to 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6, internal usage of Oort and Seti channels
  is improperly authorized, so any remote user could subscribe and publish to those
  channels. By subscribing to those channels, a remote user may be able to watch cluster-internal
  traffic that contains other users' (possibly sensitive) data. By publishing to those
  channels, a remote user may be able to create/modify/delete other user's data and
  modify the cluster structure. A fix is available in versions 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and
  7.0.6. As a workaround, install a custom `SecurityPolicy` that forbids subscription
  and publishing to remote, non-Oort, sessions on Oort and Seti channels."
