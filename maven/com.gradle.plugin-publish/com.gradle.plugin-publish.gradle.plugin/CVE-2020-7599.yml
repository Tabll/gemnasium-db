package_slug: "maven/com.gradle.plugin-publish/com.gradle.plugin-publish.gradle.plugin"
title: "Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File"
description: "All versions of com.gradle.plugin-publish before 0.11.0 is vulnerable
  to Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File. When a plugin author publishes
  a Gradle plugin while running Gradle with the --info log level flag, the Gradle
  Logger logs an AWS pre-signed URL. If this build log is publicly visible (as it
  is in many popular public CI systems like TravisCI) this AWS pre-signed URL would
  allow a malicious actor to replace a recently uploaded plugin with their own."
