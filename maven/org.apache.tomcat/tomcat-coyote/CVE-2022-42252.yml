title: "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request Smuggling')"
description: "If Apache Tomcat 8.5.0 to 8.5.52, 9.0.0-M1 to 9.0.67, 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.26
  or 10.1.0-M1 to 10.1.0 was configured to ignore invalid HTTP headers via setting
  rejectIllegalHeader to false (the default for 8.5.x only), Tomcat does not reject
  a request containing an invalid Content-Length header making a request smuggling
  attack possible if Tomcat was located behind a reverse proxy that also failed to
  reject the request with the invalid header."
