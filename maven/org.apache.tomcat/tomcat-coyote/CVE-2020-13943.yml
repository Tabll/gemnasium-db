identifier: "CVE-2020-13943"
package_slug: "maven/org.apache.tomcat/tomcat-coyote"
title: "HTTP Request Smuggling"
description: "If a `HTTP/2` client connecting to Apache Tomcat exceeded the agreed
  maximum number of concurrent streams for a connection (in violation of the `HTTP/2`
  protocol), it was possible that a subsequent request made on that connection could
  contain HTTP headers from a previous request rather than the intended headers. This
  could lead to users seeing responses for unexpected resources."
