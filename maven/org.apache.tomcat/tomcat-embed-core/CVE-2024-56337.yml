title: "Apache Tomcat Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition vulnerability"
description: "Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition vulnerability in Apache
  Tomcat.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.1, from
  10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.33, from 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.97.\n\nThe mitigation for CVE-2024-50379
  was incomplete.\n\nUsers running Tomcat on a case insensitive file system with the
  default servlet write enabled (readonly initialisation\nparameter set to the non-default
  value of false) may need additional configuration to fully mitigate CVE-2024-50379
  depending on which version of Java they are using with Tomcat:\n- running on Java
  8 or Java 11: the system property sun.io.useCanonCaches must be explicitly set to
  false (it defaults to true)\n- running on Java 17: the system property sun.io.useCanonCaches,
  if set, must be set to false (it defaults to false)\n- running on Java 21 onwards:
  no further configuration is required (the system property and the problematic cache
  have been removed)\n\nTomcat 11.0.3, 10.1.35 and 9.0.99 onwards will include checks
  that sun.io.useCanonCaches is set appropriately before allowing the default servlet
  to be write enabled on a case insensitive file system. Tomcat will also set sun.io.useCanonCaches
  to false by default where it can."
