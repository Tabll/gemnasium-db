title: "HTTP Request Smuggling"
description: "If an `HTTP/2` client connecting to Apache Tomcat to M1 to to exceeded
  the agreed maximum number of concurrent streams for a connection (in violation of
  the `HTTP/2` protocol), it was possible that a subsequent request made on that connection
  could contain HTTP headers - including `HTTP/2` pseudo headers - from a previous
  request rather than the intended headers. This could lead to users seeing responses
  for unexpected resources."
