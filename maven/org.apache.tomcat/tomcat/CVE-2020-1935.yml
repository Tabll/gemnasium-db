identifier: "CVE-2020-1935"
package_slug: "maven/org.apache.tomcat/tomcat"
title: "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests (HTTP Request Smuggling)"
description: "In Apache Tomcat, the HTTP header parsing code used an approach to end-of-line
  parsing that allowed some invalid HTTP headers to be parsed as valid. This led to
  a possibility of HTTP Request Smuggling if Tomcat was located behind a reverse proxy
  that incorrectly handled the invalid `Transfer-Encoding` header in a particular
  manner."
