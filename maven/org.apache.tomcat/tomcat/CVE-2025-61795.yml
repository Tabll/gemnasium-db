package_slug: "maven/org.apache.tomcat/tomcat"
title: "Apache Tomcat Vulnerable to Improper Resource Shutdown or Release"
description: "If an error occurred (including exceeding limits) during the processing
  of a multipart upload, temporary copies of the uploaded parts written to disc were
  not cleaned up immediately but left for the garbage collection process to delete.
  Depending on JVM settings, application memory usage and application load, it was
  possible that space for the temporary copies of uploaded parts would be filled faster
  than GC cleared it, leading to a DoS.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Tomcat: from
  11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.11, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.46, from 9.0.0.M1 through
  9.0.109.\n\nThe following versions were EOL at the time the CVE was created but
  are\nknown to be affected: 8.5.0 though 8.5.100. Other, older, EOL versions may
  also be affected.\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.12 or later,
  10.1.47 or later or 9.0.110 or later which fixes the issue."
