identifier: "CVE-2019-12418"
package_slug: "maven/org.apache.tomcat/tomcat"
title: "Insufficiently Protected Credentials"
description: "When Apache Tomcat is configured with the JMX Remote Lifecycle Listener,
  a local attacker without access to the Tomcat process or configuration files is
  able to manipulate the RMI registry to perform a man-in-the-middle attack to capture
  user names and passwords used to access the JMX interface. The attacker can then
  use these credentials to access the JMX interface and gain complete control over
  the Tomcat instance."
