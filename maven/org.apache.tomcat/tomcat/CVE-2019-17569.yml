package_slug: "maven/org.apache.tomcat/tomcat"
title: "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request Smuggling')"
description: "The refactoring present in Apache Tomcat 9.0.28 to 9.0.30, 8.5.48 to
  8.5.50 and 7.0.98 to 7.0.99 introduced a regression. The result of the regression
  was that invalid Transfer-Encoding headers were incorrectly processed leading to
  a possibility of HTTP Request Smuggling if Tomcat was located behind a reverse proxy
  that incorrectly handled the invalid Transfer-Encoding header in a particular manner.
  Such a reverse proxy is considered unlikely."
