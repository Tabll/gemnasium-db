package_slug: "maven/org.apache.tomcat/tomcat"
title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor in Apache Tomcat"
description: "If an HTTP/2 client connecting to Apache Tomcat 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0-M7,
  9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.37 or 8.5.0 to 8.5.57 exceeded the agreed maximum number of concurrent
  streams for a connection (in violation of the HTTP/2 protocol), it was possible
  that a subsequent request made on that connection could contain HTTP headers - including
  HTTP/2 pseudo headers - from a previous request rather than the intended headers.
  This could lead to users seeing responses for unexpected resources."
