  9.0.81 and from 8.5.0 through 8.5.93 does not correctly parse HTTP trailer headers.
  A specially \ncrafted, invalid trailer header could cause Tomcat to treat a single
  \nrequest as multiple requests leading to the possibility of request \nsmuggling
  when behind a reverse proxy.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.0-M12
  onwards, 10.1.14 onwards, 9.0.81 onwards or 8.5.94 onwards, which fix the issue.\n\n"
