title: "Apache Tomcat Improper Input Validation vulnerability"
description: "Improper Input Validation vulnerability in Apache Tomcat.\n\nTomcatÂ from
  11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M11, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.13, from 9.0.0-M1 through
  9.0.81 and from 8.5.0 through 8.5.93 did not correctly parse HTTP trailer headers.
  A specially crafted, invalid trailer header could cause Tomcat to treat a single\nrequest
  as multiple requests leading to the possibility of request smuggling when behind
  a reverse proxy.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.0-M12 onwards,
  10.1.14 onwards, 9.0.81 onwards or 8.5.94 onwards, which fix the issue."
