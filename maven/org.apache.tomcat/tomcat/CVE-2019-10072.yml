package_slug: "maven/org.apache.tomcat/tomcat"
title: "HTTP/2 DoS"
description: "The fix for CVE-2019-0199 was incomplete and did not address HTTP/2
  connection window exhaustion on write in Apache Tomcat. By not sending `WINDOW_UPDATE`
  messages for the connection window (stream 0) clients were able to cause server-side
  threads to block eventually leading to thread exhaustion and a DoS."
