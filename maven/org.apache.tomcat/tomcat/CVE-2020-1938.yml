package_slug: "maven/org.apache.tomcat/tomcat"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "When using the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP), care must be taken when
  trusting incoming connections to Apache Tomcat. Tomcat treats AJP connections as
  having higher trust than, for example, a similar HTTP connection. If such connections
  are available to an attacker, they can be exploited in ways that may be surprising."
