identifier: "CVE-2019-0199"
package_slug: "maven/org.apache.tomcat/tomcat-util"
title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "The HTTP/2 implementation in Apache Tomcat accepted streams with excessive
  numbers of `SETTINGS` frames and also permitted clients to keep streams open without
  reading/writing request/response data. By keeping streams open for requests that
  utilised the Servlet API's blocking I/O, clients were able to cause server-side
  threads to block eventually leading to thread exhaustion and a DoS."
