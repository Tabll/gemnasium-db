title: "Apache Tomcat - Security constraint bypass with HTTP/0.9"
description: "Improper Input Validation vulnerability in Apache Tomcat.\n\nTomcat
  did not limit HTTP/0.9 requests to the GET method. If a security constraint was
  configured to allow HEAD requests to a URI but deny GET requests, the user could
  bypass that constraint on GET requests by sending a (specification invalid) HEAD
  request using HTTP/0.9.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through
  11.0.14, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.49, from 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.112.\n\n\nOlder,
  EOL versions are also affected.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.15
  or later, 10.1.50 or later or 9.0.113 or later, which fixes the issue."
