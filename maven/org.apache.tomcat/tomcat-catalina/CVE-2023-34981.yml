package_slug: "maven/org.apache.tomcat/tomcat-catalina"
title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "A regression in the fix for bug 66512 in Apache Tomcat 11.0.0-M5, 10.1.8,
  9.0.74 and 8.5.88 meant that, if a response does not include any HTTP headers no
  AJP SEND_HEADERS messare would be sent for the response which in turn meant that
  at least one AJP proxy (mod_proxy_ajp) would use the response headers from the previous
  request leading to an information leak."
