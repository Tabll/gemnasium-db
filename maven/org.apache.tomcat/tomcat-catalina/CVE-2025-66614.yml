title: "Apache Tomcat - Client certificate verification bypass"
description: "Improper Input Validation vulnerability.\n\nThis issue affects Apache
  Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.14, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.49, from 9.0.0-M1
  through 9.0.112.\n\nThe following versions were EOL at the time the CVE was created
  but are known to be affected: 8.5.0 through 8.5.100. Older EOL versions are not
  affected. Tomcat did not validate that the host name provided via the SNI extension
  was the same as the host name provided in the HTTP host header field. If Tomcat
  was configured with more than one virtual host and the TLS configuration for one
  of those hosts did not require client certificate authentication but another one
  did, it was possible for a client to bypass the client certificate authentication
  by sending different host names in the SNI extension and the HTTP host header field.\n\nThe
  vulnerability only applies if client certificate authentication is only enforced
  at the Connector. It does not apply if client certificate authentication is enforced
  at the web application.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.15 or
  later, 10.1.50 or later or 9.0.113 or later, which fix the issue."
