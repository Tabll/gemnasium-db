title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "Improper Input Validation vulnerability in Apache Tomcat.Tomcat from
  11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M10, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.15, from 9.0.0-M1 through
  9.0.82 and from 8.5.0 through 8.5.95 does not correctly parse HTTP trailer headers.
  A trailer header that exceeded the header size limit could cause Tomcat to treat
  a single \nrequest as multiple requests leading to the possibility of request \nsmuggling
  when behind a reverse proxy.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.0-M11Â onwards,
  10.1.16 onwards, 9.0.83 onwards or 8.5.96 onwards, which fix the issue.\n\n"
