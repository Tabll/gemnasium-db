  was able to view security sensitive files and/or inject content into those files:\n- writes
  enabled for the default servlet (disabled by default)\n- support for partial PUT
  (enabled by default)\n- a target URL for security sensitive uploads that was a sub-directory
  of a target URL for public uploads\n- attacker knowledge of the names of security
  sensitive files being uploaded\n- the security sensitive files also being uploaded
  via partial PUT\n\nIf all of the following were true, a malicious user was able
