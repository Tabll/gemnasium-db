package_slug: "maven/org.apache.tomcat/tomcat-catalina"
title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "When using Apache Tomcat to M1 to to to if a) an attacker is able to
  control the contents and name of a file on the server; and b) the server is configured
  to use the `PersistenceManager` with a `FileStore`; and c) the `PersistenceManager`
  is configured with `sessionAttributeValueClassNameFilter=\"null\"` (the default
  unless a `SecurityManager` is used) or a sufficiently lax filter to allow the attacker
  provided object to be deserialized; and d) the attacker knows the relative file
  path from the storage location used by `FileStore` to the file the attacker has
  control over; then, using a specifically crafted request, the attacker will be able
  to trigger remote code execution via deserialization of the file under their control.
  Note that all of conditions a) to d) must be true for the attack to succeed."
