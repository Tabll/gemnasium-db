title: "Apache Cassandra: User with MODIFY permission on ALL KEYSPACES can escalate
  privileges to superuser via unsafe actions (4.0.16 only)"
description: "Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions vulnerability in Apache Cassandra.
  An user with MODIFY permission ON ALL KEYSPACES can escalate privileges to superuser
  within a targeted Cassandra cluster via unsafe actions to a system resource. Operators
  granting data MODIFY permission on all keyspaces on affected versions should review
  data access rules for potential breaches.\n\n\n\nThis issue affects Apache Cassandra
  3.0.30, 3.11.17, 4.0.16, 4.1.7, 5.0.2, but this advisory is only for 4.0.16 because
  the fix to CVE-2025-23015 was incorrectly applied to 4.0.16, so that version is
  still affected.\n\nUsers in the 4.0 series are recommended to upgrade to version
  4.0.17 which fixes the issue. Users from 3.0, 3.11, 4.1 and 5.0 series should follow
  recommendation from CVE-2025-23015."
