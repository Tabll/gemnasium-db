  privileges to superuser via unsafe actions"
description: "Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions vulnerability in Apache Cassandra.
  An user with MODIFY permission ON ALL KEYSPACES can escalate privileges to superuser
  within a targeted Cassandra cluster via unsafe actions to a system resource. Operators

  data access rules for potential breaches.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Cassandra
  through 3.0.30, 3.11.17, 4.0.15, 4.1.7, 5.0.2.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade
