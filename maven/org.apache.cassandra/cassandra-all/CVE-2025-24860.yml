title: "Apache Cassandra: CassandraNetworkAuthorizer and CassandraCIDRAuthorizer can
  be bypassed allowing access to different network regions"
description: "Incorrect Authorization vulnerability in Apache Cassandra allowing users
  to access a datacenter or IP/CIDR groups they should not be able to when using CassandraNetworkAuthorizer
  or CassandraCIDRAuthorizer.\n\nUsers with restricted data center access can update
  their own permissions via data control language (DCL) statements on affected versions.\n\nThis
  issue affects Apache Cassandra: from 4.0.0 through 4.0.15 and from 4.1.0 through
  4.1.7 for CassandraNetworkAuthorizer, and from 5.0.0 through 5.0.2 for both CassandraNetworkAuthorizer
  and CassandraCIDRAuthorizer.\n\nOperators using CassandraNetworkAuthorizer or CassandraCIDRAuthorizer
  on affected versions should review data access rules for potential breaches. Users
  are recommended to upgrade to versions 4.0.16, 4.1.8, 5.0.3, which fixes the issue."
