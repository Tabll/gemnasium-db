package_slug: "maven/com.gradle/gradle-enterprise-maven-extension"
title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "An issue was discovered in the Maven Extension plugin before 1.6 for
  Gradle Enterprise. The extension uses a socket connection to send serialized Java
  objects. Deserialization is not restricted to an allow-list, thus allowing an attacker
  to achieve code execution via a malicious deserialization gadget chain. The socket
  is not bound exclusively to localhost. The port this socket is assigned to is randomly
  selected and is not intentionally exposed to the public (either by design or documentation).
  This could potentially be used to achieve remote code execution and local privilege
  escalation."
