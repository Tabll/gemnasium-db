description: "FileUtil.extract() enumerates all zip file entries and extracts each
  file without validating whether file paths in the archive are outside the intended
  directory.\n\nWhen creating an instance of TensorflowModel using the saved_model
  format and an exported tensorflow model, the apply() function invokes the vulnerable
  implementation of FileUtil.extract().\n\nArbitrary file creation can directly lead
  to code execution\n\n"
