title: "Eclipse Vert.x memory leak"
description: "A vulnerability in the Eclipse Vert.x toolkit results in a memory leak
  due to using Netty FastThreadLocal data structures. Specifically, when the Vert.x
  HTTP client establishes connections to different hosts, triggering the memory leak.
  The leak can be accelerated with intimate runtime knowledge, allowing an attacker
  to exploit this vulnerability. For instance, a server accepting arbitrary internet
  addresses could serve as an attack vector by connecting to these addresses, thereby
  accelerating the memory leak."
