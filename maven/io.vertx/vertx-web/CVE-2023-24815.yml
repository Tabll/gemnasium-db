package_slug: "maven/io.vertx/vertx-web"
title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "Vert.x-Web is a set of building blocks for building web applications
  in the java programming language. When running vertx web applications that serve
  files using `StaticHandler` on Windows Operating Systems and Windows File Systems,
  if the mount point is a wildcard (`*`) then an attacker can exfiltrate any class
  path resource. When computing the relative path to locate the resource, in case
  of wildcards, the code: `return \"/\" + rest;` from `Utils.java` returns the user
  input (without validation) as the segment to lookup. Even though checks are performed
  to avoid escaping the sandbox, given that the input was not sanitized `\\` are not
  properly handled and an attacker can build a path that is valid within the classpath.
  This issue only affects users deploying in windows environments and upgrading is
  the advised remediation path. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
