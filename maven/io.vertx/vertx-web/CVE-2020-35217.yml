identifier: "CVE-2020-35217"
package_slug: "maven/io.vertx/vertx-web"
title: "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
description: "Vert.x-Web framework does not perform a correct CSRF verification. Instead
  of comparing the CSRF token in the request with the CSRF token in the cookie, it
  compares the CSRF token in the cookie against a CSRF token that is stored in the
  session. An attacker does not even need to provide a CSRF token in the request because
  the framework does not consider it. The cookies are automatically sent by the browser
  and the verification will always succeed, leading to a successful CSRF attack."
