identifier: "CVE-2020-35217"
package_slug: "maven/io.vertx/vertx-web"
title: "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
description: "Vert.x-Web framework does not perform a correct
  CSRF verification. Instead of comparing the CSRF token in the request with the CSRF
  token in the cookie, it compares the CSRF token in the cookie against a CSRF token
  that is stored in the session. An attacker does not even need to provide a CSRF
  token in the request because the framework does not consider it. The cookies are
  automatically sent by the browser and the verification will always succeed, leading
  to a successful CSRF attack."
