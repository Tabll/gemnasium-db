title: "Vert.x-Web Access Control Flaw in StaticHandler’s Hidden File Protection for
  Files Under Hidden Directories"
description: "There is a flaw in the hidden file protection feature of Vert.x Web’s
  `StaticHandler` when `setIncludeHidden(false)` is configured.\n\nIn the current
  implementation, only files whose final path segment (i.e., the file name) begins
  with a dot (`.`) are treated as “hidden” and are blocked from being served. However,
  this logic fails in the following cases:\n\n- **Files under hidden directories**:
  For example, `/.secret/config.txt` — although `.secret` is a hidden directory, the
  file `config.txt` itself does not start with a dot, so it gets served.\n- **Real-world
  impact**: Sensitive files placed in hidden directories like `.git`, `.env`, `.aws`
  may become publicly accessible.\n\nAs a result, the behavior does not meet the expectations
  set by the `includeHidden=false` configuration, which should ideally protect all
  hidden files and directories. This gap may lead to unintended exposure of sensitive
  information."
