title: "WSO2 API Manager XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability"
description: "An XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability exists in the gateway component
  of WSO2 API Manager due to insufficient validation of XML input in crafted URL paths.
  User-supplied XML is parsed without appropriate restrictions, enabling external
  entity resolution.\n\nThis vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated
  remote attacker to read files from the serverâ€™s filesystem or perform denial-of-service
  (DoS) attacks.\n\n*  On systems running JDK 7 or early JDK 8, full file contents
  may be exposed.\n\n*  On later versions of JDK 8 and newer, only the first line
  of a file may be read, due to improvements in XML parser behavior.\n\n*  DoS attacks
  such as \"Billion Laughs\" payloads can cause service disruption."
