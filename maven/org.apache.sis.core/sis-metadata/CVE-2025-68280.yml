title: "Apache SIS has Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference vulnerability"
description: "Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference vulnerability
  in Apache SIS.\n\n\n\nIt is possible to write XML files in such a way that, when
  parsed by Apache SIS, an XML file reveals to the attacker the content of a local
  file on the server running Apache SIS. This vulnerability impacts the following
  SIS services:\n\n\n\n\n*  Reading of GeoTIFF files having the GEO_METADATA tag defined
  by the Defense Geospatial Information Working Group (DGIWG).\n\n*  Parsing of ISO
  19115 metadata in XML format.\n\n*  Parsing of Coordinate Reference Systems defined
  in the GML format.\n\n*  Parsing of files in GPS Exchange Format (GPX).\n\n\n\n\n\nThis
  issue affects Apache SIS from versions 0.4 through 1.5 inclusive. Users are recommended
  to upgrade to version 1.6, which will fix the issue. In the meantime, the security
  vulnerability can be avoided by launching Java with the javax.xml.accessExternalDTD
  system property sets to a comma-separated list of authorized protocols. For example:\n\n\n\njava
  -Djavax.xml.accessExternalDTD=\"\" ..."
