identifier: "CVE-2021-25641"
package_slug: "maven/org.apache.dubbo/dubbo"
title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "Each Apache Dubbo server will set a serialization id to tell the clients
  which serialization protocol it is working on. But for Dubbo, an attacker can choose
  which serialization id the Provider will use by tampering with the byte preamble
  flags, aka, not following the server's instruction. This means that if a weak deserializer
  such as the Kryo and FST are somehow in code scope (e.g. if Kryo is somehow a part
  of a dependency), a remote unauthenticated attacker can tell the Provider to use
  the weak deserializer, and then proceed to exploit it."
