package_slug: "maven/org.apache.dubbo/dubbo"
title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "Apache Dubbo is a java based, open source RPC framework. Versions prior
  to 2.6.10 and 2.7.10 is vulnerable to pre-auth remote code execution via arbitrary
  bean manipulation in the Telnet handler. The Dubbo main service port can be used
  to access a Telnet Handler which offers some basic methods to collect information
  about the providers and methods exposed by the service and it can even allow to
  shutdown the service. This endpoint is unprotected. Additionally, a provider method
  can be invoked using the `invoke` handler. This handler uses a safe version of FastJson
  to process the call arguments. However, the resulting list is later processed with
  `PojoUtils.realize` which can be used to instantiate arbitrary classes and invoke
  its setters. Even though FastJson is properly protected with a default blocklist,
  `PojoUtils.realize` is not, and an attacker can leverage that to achieve remote
  code execution. Versions 2.6.10 and 2.7.10 contain fixes for this issue."
