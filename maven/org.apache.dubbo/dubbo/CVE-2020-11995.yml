identifier: "CVE-2020-11995"
package_slug: "maven/org.apache.dubbo/dubbo"
title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "A deserialization vulnerability existed in dubbo which could lead to
  malicious code execution. Most Dubbo users use `Hessian2` as the default serialization/deserialization
  protool, during `Hessian2` deserializing the HashMap object, some functions in the
  classes stored in HasMap will be executed after a series of program calls, however,
  those special functions may cause remote command execution. For example, the `hashCode()`
  function of the EqualsBean class in rome-1.7.0.jar will cause the remotely load
  malicious classes and execute malicious code by constructing a malicious request.
  This issue was fixed in Apache Dubbo "
