package_slug: "maven/org.apache.dubbo/dubbo"
title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "Apache Dubbo by default supports generic calls to arbitrary methods
  exposed by provider interfaces. These invocations are handled by the GenericFilter
  which will find the service and method specified in the first arguments of the invocation
  and use the Java Reflection API to make the final call. The signature for the $invoke
  or $invokeAsync methods is Ljava/lang/String;[Ljava/lang/String;[Ljava/lang/Object;
  where the first argument is the name of the method to invoke, the second one is
  an array with the parameter types for the method being invoked and the third one
  is an array with the actual call arguments."
