title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "A deserialization vulnerability existed in dubbo and its earlier versions,
  which could lead to malicious code execution. Most Dubbo users use Hessian2 as the
  default serialization/deserialization protool, during Hessian2 deserializing the
  HashMap object, some functions in the classes stored in HasMap will be executed
  after a series of program calls, however, those special functions may cause remote
  command execution."
