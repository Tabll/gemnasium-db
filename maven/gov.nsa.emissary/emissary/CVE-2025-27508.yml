package_slug: "maven/gov.nsa.emissary/emissary"
title: "Emissary May Use a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm"
description: "The ChecksumCalculator class within  allows for hashing and checksum
  generation, but it includes or defaults to algorithms that are no longer recommended
  for secure cryptographic use cases (e.g., SHA-1, CRC32, and SSDEEP). These algorithms,
  while possibly valid for certain non-security-critical tasks, can expose users to
  security risks if used in scenarios where strong cryptographic guarantees are required."
