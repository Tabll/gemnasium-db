title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "Addresses partial fix in CVE-2018-1263. Spring-integration-zip, versions
  prior to 1.0.4, exposes an arbitrary file write vulnerability, that can be achieved
  using a specially crafted zip archive (affects other archives as well, bzip2, tar,
  xz, war, cpio, 7z), that holds path traversal filenames. So when the filename gets
  concatenated to the target extraction directory, the final path ends up outside
  of the target folder."
