title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "Spring-integration-zip versions prior to 1.0.1 exposes an arbitrary
  file write vulnerability, which can be achieved using a specially crafted zip archive
  (affects other archives as well, bzip2, tar, xz, war, cpio, 7z) that holds path
  traversal filenames. So when the filename gets concatenated to the target extraction
  directory, the final path ends up outside of the target folder."
