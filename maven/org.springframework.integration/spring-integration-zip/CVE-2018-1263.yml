title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "Addresses partial fix in CVE-2018-1261. Pivotal spring-integration-zip,
  versions prior to 1.0.2, exposes an arbitrary file write vulnerability, that can
  be achieved using a specially crafted zip archive (affects other archives as well,
  bzip2, tar, xz, war, cpio, 7z), that holds path traversal filenames. So when the
  filename gets concatenated to the target extraction directory, the final path ends
  up outside of the target folder."
