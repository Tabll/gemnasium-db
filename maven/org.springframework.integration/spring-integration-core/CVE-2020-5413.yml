title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "Spring Integration framework provides Kryo Codec implementations as
  an alternative for Java (de)serialization. When Kryo is configured with default
  options, all unregistered classes are resolved on demand. This leads to the \"deserialization
  gadgets\" exploit when provided data contains malicious code for execution during
  deserialization. In order to protect against this type of attack, Kryo can be configured
  to require a set of trusted classes for (de)serialization. Spring Integration should
  be proactive against blocking unknown \"deserialization gadgets\" when configuring
  Kryo in code."
