title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command
  Injection')"
description: "Ballcat Codegen provides the function of online editing code to generate
  templates. In versions prior to 1.0.0.beta.2, attackers can implement remote code
  execution through malicious code injection of the template engine. This happens
  because Velocity and freemarker templates are introduced but input verification
  is not done. The fault is rectified in version 1.0.0.beta.2."
