title: "Pebble has Arbitrary Local File Inclusion (LFI) Vulnerability via `include`
  macro"
description: "If untrusted user input is used to dynamically create a `PebbleTemplate`
  with the method `PebbleEngine#getLiteralTemplate`, then an attacker can include
  arbitrary local files from the file system into the generated template, leaking
  potentially sensitive information into the output of `PebbleTemplate#evaluate`.
  This is done via the `include` macro."
