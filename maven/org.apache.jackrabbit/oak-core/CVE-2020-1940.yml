description: "The optional initial password change and password expiration features
  are prone to a sensitive information disclosure vulnerability. The code mandates
  the changed password to be passed as an additional attribute to the credentials
  object but does not remove it upon processing during the first phase of the authentication.
  In combination with additional, independent authentication mechanisms, this may
  lead to the new password being disclosed."
