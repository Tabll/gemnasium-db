title: "Nu Html Checker (vnu) contains a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability"
description: "Nu Html Checker (validator.nu) contains a restriction bypass that allows
  remote attackers to make the server perform arbitrary HTTP/HTTPS requests to internal
  resources, including localhost services. While the validator implements hostname-based
  protections to block direct access to localhost and 127.0.0.1, these controls can
  be bypassed using DNS rebinding techniques or domains that resolve to loopback addresses.This
  issue affects The Nu Html Checker (vnu): latest (commit 23f090a11bab8d0d4e698f1ffc197a4fe226a9cd)."
