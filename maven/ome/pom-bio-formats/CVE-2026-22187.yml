title: "Bio-Formats performs unsafe Java deserialization of attacker-controlled memoization
  cache files (.bfmemo) during image processing"
description: "Bio-Formats versions up to and including 8.3.0 perform unsafe Java deserialization
  of attacker-controlled memoization cache files (.bfmemo) during image processing.
  The loci.formats.Memoizer class automatically loads and deserializes memo files
  associated with images without validation, integrity checks, or trust enforcement.
  An attacker who can supply a crafted .bfmemo file alongside an image can trigger
  deserialization of untrusted data, which may result in denial of service, logic
  manipulation, or potentially remote code execution in environments where suitable
  gadget chains are present on the classpath."
