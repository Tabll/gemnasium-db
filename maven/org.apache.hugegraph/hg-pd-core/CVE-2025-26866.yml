title: "Apache HugeGraph-Server: RAFT and deserialization vulnerability"
description: "A remote code execution vulnerability exists where a malicious Raft
  node can exploit insecure Hessian deserialization within the PD store. The fix enforces
  IP-based authentication to restrict cluster membership and implements a strict class
  `whitelist` to harden the Hessian serialization process against object injection
  attacks.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 1.7.0, which fixes the issue."
