title: "Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort in Apache Derby"
description: "The password hash generation algorithm in the BUILTIN authentication
  functionality for Apache Derby before 10.6.1.0 performs a transformation that reduces
  the size of the set of inputs to SHA-1, which produces a small search space that
  makes it easier for local and possibly remote attackers to crack passwords by generating
  hash collisions, related to password substitution."
