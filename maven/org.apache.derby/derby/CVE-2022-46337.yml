title: "Apache Derby: LDAP injection vulnerability in authenticator"
description: "A cleverly devised username might bypass LDAP authentication checks.
  In \nLDAP-authenticated Derby installations, this could let an attacker fill \nup
  the disk by creating junk Derby databases. In LDAP-authenticated \nDerby installations,
  this could also allow the attacker to execute \nmalware which was visible to and
  executable by the account which booted \nthe Derby server. In LDAP-protected databases
  which weren't also \nprotected by SQL GRANT/REVOKE authorization, this vulnerability
  could \nalso let an attacker view and corrupt sensitive data and run sensitive \ndatabase
  functions and procedures.\n\nMitigation:\n\nUsers should upgrade to Java 21 and
  Derby 10.17.1.0.\n\nAlternatively, users who wish to remain on older Java versions
  should \nbuild their own Derby distribution from one of the release families to
  \nwhich the fix was backported: 10.16, 10.15, and 10.14. Those are the \nreleases
  which correspond, respectively, with Java LTS versions 17, 11, \nand 8.\n\n"
