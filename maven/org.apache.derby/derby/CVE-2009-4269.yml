identifier: "CVE-2009-4269"
package_slug: "maven/org.apache.derby/derby"
title: "Weak password hash generation"
description: "The password hash generation algorithm in this package performs a transformation
  that reduces the size of the set of inputs to `SHA-1`, which produces a small search
  space that makes it easier for local and possibly remote attackers to crack passwords
  by generating hash collisions, related to password substitution."
