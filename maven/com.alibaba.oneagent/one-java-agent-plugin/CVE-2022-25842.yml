description: "All versions of package com.alibaba.oneagent:one-java-agent-plugin is
  vulnerable to Arbitrary File Write via Archive Extraction (Zip Slip) using a specially
  crafted archive that holds directory traversal filenames (e.g. ../../evil.exe).
  The attacker can overwrite executable files and either invoke them remotely or wait
  for the system or user to call them, thus achieving remote command execution on
  the victimâ€™s machine."
