title: "Command Injection"
description: "A remote code execution vulnerability occurs in OpenTSDB via command
  injection in the `yrange` parameter. The `yrange` value is written to a gnuplot
  file in the `/tmp` directory. This file is then executed via the `mygnuplot.sh`
  shell script. (`tsd/GraphHandler.java` attempted to prevent command injections by
  blocking backticks but this is insufficient)."
