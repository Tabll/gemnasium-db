package_slug: "maven/net.opentsdb/opentsdb"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command
  Injection')"
description: "\nDue to insufficient validation of parameters passed to the legacy
  HTTP query API, it is possible to inject crafted OS commands into multiple parameters
  and execute malicious code on the OpenTSDB host system. This exploit exists due
  to an incomplete fix that was made when this vulnerability was previously disclosed
  as CVE-2020-35476. Regex validation that was implemented to restrict allowed input
  to the query API does not work as intended, allowing crafted commands to bypass
  validation.\n\n"
