title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "The fix for CVE-2020-9484 was incomplete. When using Apache Tomcat with 
  a configuration edge case that was highly unlikely to be used, the Tomcat instance 
  was still vulnerable to CVE-2020-9494. Note that both the previously
  published prerequisites for CVE-2020-9484 and the previously published mitigations
  for CVE-2020-9484 also apply to this issue."
