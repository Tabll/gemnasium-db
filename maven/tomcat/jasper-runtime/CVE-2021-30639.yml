package_slug: "maven/tomcat/jasper-runtime"
title: "Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions"
description: "A vulnerability in Apache Tomcat allows an attacker to remotely trigger
  a denial of service. An error introduced as part of a change to improve error handling
  during non-blocking I/O meant that the error flag associated with the `Request`
  object was not reset between requests. This meant that once a non-blocking I/O error
  occurred, all future requests handled by that request object would fail. Users were
  able to trigger non-blocking I/O errors, e.g. by dropping a connection, thereby
  creating the possibility of triggering a DoS. Applications that do not use non-blocking
  I/O are not exposed to this vulnerability."
