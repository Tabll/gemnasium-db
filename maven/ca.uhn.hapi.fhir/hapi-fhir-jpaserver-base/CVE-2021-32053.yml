description: "JPA Server in HAPI FHIR before 5.4.0 allows a user to deny service (e.g.,
  disable access to the database after the attack stops) via history requests. This
  occurs because of a SELECT COUNT statement that requires a full index scan, with
  an accompanying large amount of server resources if there are many simultaneous
  history requests."
