identifier: "CVE-2019-12741"
package_slug: "maven/ca.uhn.hapi.fhir/hapi-fhir"
title: "Cross-site Scripting"
description: "XSS exists in the HAPI FHIR testpage overlay module of the HAPI FHIR library.
  The attack involves unsanitized HTTP parameters being output in a form page,
  allowing attackers to leak cookies and other sensitive information from
  `ca/uhn/fhir/to/BaseController.java` via a specially crafted URL. (This
  module is not generally used in production systems so the attack surface is
  expected to be low, but affected systems are recommended to upgrade
  immediately.)"
