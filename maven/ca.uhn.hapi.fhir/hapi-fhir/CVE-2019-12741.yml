identifier: "CVE-2019-12741"
package_slug: "maven/ca.uhn.hapi.fhir/hapi-fhir"
title: "Cross-site Scripting"
description: "XSS exists in the HAPI FHIR testpage overlay module of the HAPI FHIR
  library. The attack involves unsanitized HTTP parameters being output in a form
  page, allowing attackers to leak cookies and other sensitive information from `ca/uhn/fhir/to/BaseController.java`
  via a specially crafted URL. (This module is not generally used in production systems
  so the attack surface is expected to be low, but affected systems are recommended
  to upgrade immediately.)"
