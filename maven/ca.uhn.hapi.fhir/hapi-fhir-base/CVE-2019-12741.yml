package_slug: "maven/ca.uhn.hapi.fhir/hapi-fhir-base"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "XSS exists in the HAPI FHIR testpage overlay module of the HAPI FHIR
  library before 3.8.0. The attack involves unsanitized HTTP parameters being output
  in a form page, allowing attackers to leak cookies and other sensitive information
  from ca/uhn/fhir/to/BaseController.java via a specially crafted URL. (This module
  is not generally used in production systems so the attack surface is expected to
  be low, but affected systems are recommended to upgrade immediately.)"
