package_slug: "maven/org.jruby/jruby"
title: "JRuby-OpenSSL has hostname verification disabled by default"
description: "When verifying SSL certificates, jruby-openssl is not verifying that
  the hostname presented in the certificate matches the one we are trying to connect
  to, meaning a MITM could just present _any_ valid cert for a completely different
  domain they own, and JRuby wouldn't complain."
