title: "ThingsBoard allows an authenticated user to upload malicious SVG images"
description: "ThingsBoard in versions prior to v4.2.1 allows an authenticated user
  to upload malicious SVG images via the \"Image Gallery\", leading to a Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The exploit can be triggered when any user accesses
  the public API endpoint of the malicious SVG images, or if the malicious images
  are embedded in an `iframe` element, during a widget creation, deployed to any page
  of the platform (e.g., dashboards), and accessed during normal operations. The vulnerability
  resides in the `ImageController`, which fails to restrict the execution of JavaScript
  code when an image is loaded by the user's browser. This vulnerability can lead
  to the execution of malicious code in the context of other users' sessions, potentially
  compromising their accounts and allowing unauthorized actions."
