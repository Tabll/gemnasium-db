title: "Stack-based Buffer Overflow"
description: "XStream serializes Java objects to XML and back again. Versions prior
  to 1.4.20 may allow a remote attacker to terminate the application with a stack
  overflow error, resulting in a denial of service only via manipulation the processed
  input stream. The attack uses the hash code implementation for collections and maps
  to force recursive hash calculation causing a stack overflow. This issue is patched
  in version 1.4.20 which handles the stack overflow and raises an InputManipulationException
  instead. A potential workaround for users who only use HashMap or HashSet and whose
  XML refers these only as default map or set, is to change the default implementation
  of java.util.Map and java.util per the code example in the referenced advisory.
  However, this implies that your application does not care about the implementation
  of the map and all elements are comparable."
