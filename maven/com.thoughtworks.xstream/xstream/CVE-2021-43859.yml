title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "XStream is an open source java library to serialize objects to XML and
  back again. may allow a remote attacker to allocate % CPU time on the target system
  depending on CPU type or parallel execution of such a payload resulting in a denial
  of service only by manipulating the processed input stream. XStream monitors and
  accumulates the time it takes to add elements to collections and throws an exception
  if a set threshold is exceeded. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.
  Users unable to upgrade may set the NO_REFERENCE mode to prevent recursion. See
  GHSA-rmr5-cpv2-vgjf for further details on a workaround if an upgrade is not possible."
