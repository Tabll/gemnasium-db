identifier: "CVE-2021-39139"
package_slug: "maven/com.thoughtworks.xstream/xstream"
title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "XStream is a simple library to serialize objects to XML and back again. 
  This vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to load and execute arbitrary code 
  from a remote host only by manipulating the processed input stream. A user is only 
  affected if using the version out of the box with JDK 1.7u21 or below. However, 
  this scenario can be adjusted easily to an external Xalan that works regardless of 
  the version of the Java runtime. Users who followed the recommendation to setup 
  XStream's security framework with an allow list limited to the minimal required 
  types are not impacted."
