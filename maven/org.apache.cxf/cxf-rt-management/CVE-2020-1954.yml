identifier: "CVE-2020-1954"
package_slug: "maven/org.apache.cxf/cxf-rt-management"
title: "Information Exposure"
description: "Apache CXF has the ability to integrate with JMX by registering an `InstrumentationManager`
  extension with the CXF bus. If the ‘createMBServerConnectorFactory‘ property of
  the default `InstrumentationManagerImpl` is not disabled, then it is vulnerable
  to a man-in-the-middle (MITM) style attack. An attacker on the same host can connect
  to the registry and rebind the entry to another server, thus acting as a proxy to
  the original. They are then able to gain access to all of the information that is
  sent and received over JMX."
