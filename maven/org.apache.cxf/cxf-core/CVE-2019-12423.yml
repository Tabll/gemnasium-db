identifier: "CVE-2019-12423"
package_slug: "maven/org.apache.cxf/cxf-core"
title: "Insufficiently Protected Credentials"
description: "Apache CXF ships with a OpenId Connect JWK Keys service, which allows
  a client to obtain the public keys in JWK format, which can then be used to verify
  the signature of tokens issued by the service. Typically, the service obtains the
  public key from a local keystore (JKS/PKCS12) by specifing the path of the keystore
  and the alias of the keystore entry. This case is not vulnerable. However it is
  also possible to obtain the keys from a JWK keystore file, by setting the configuration
  parameter `rs.security.keystore.type` to `jwk`. For this case all keys are returned
  in this file, including all private key and secret key credentials. This is an obvious
  security risk if the user has configured the signature keystore file with private
  or secret key credentials."
