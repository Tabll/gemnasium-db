identifier: "CVE-2019-17573"
package_slug: "maven/org.apache.cxf/cxf-core"
title: "Cross-site Scripting"
description: "By default, Apache CXF creates a `/services` page containing a listing
  of the available endpoint names and addresses. This webpage is vulnerable to a reflected
  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack, which allows a malicious actor to inject javascript
  into the web page. Please note that the attack exploits a feature which is not typically
  present in modern browsers, which remove dot segments before sending the request.
  However, Mobile applications may be vulnerable."
