package_slug: "maven/org.apache.cxf/cxf-core"
title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "Apache CXF provides all of the components that are required to build
  a fully fledged OpenId Connect service. There is a vulnerability in the access token
  services, where it does not validate that the authenticated principal is equal to
  that of the supplied `clientId` parameter in the request. If a malicious client
  was able to somehow steal an authorization code issued to another client, then they
  could exploit this vulnerability to obtain an access token for the other client."
