title: "Apache CXF is vulnerable to DoS attacks as entire files are read into memory
  and logged"
description: "Apache CXF stores large stream based messages as temporary files on
  the local filesystem. A bug was introduced which means that the entire temporary
  file is read into memory and then logged. An attacker might be able to exploit this
  to cause a denial of service attack by causing an out of memory exception. In addition,
  it is possible to configure CXF to encrypt temporary files to prevent sensitive
  credentials from being cached unencrypted on the local filesystem, however this
  bug means that the cached files are written out to logs unencrypted.\n\nUsers are
  recommended to upgrade to versions 3.5.11, 3.6.6, 4.0.7 or 4.1.1, which fixes this
  issue."
