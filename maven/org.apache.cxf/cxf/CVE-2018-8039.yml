identifier: "CVE-2018-8039"
package_slug: "maven/org.apache.cxf/cxf"
title: "Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions"
description: "It is possible to configure Apache CXF to use the `com.sun.net.ssl`
  implementation via `System.setProperty`. When this system property is set, CXF uses
  some reflection to try to make the `HostnameVerifier` work with the old `com.sun.net.ssl.HostnameVerifier`
  interface. However, the default `HostnameVerifier` implementation in CXF does not
  implement the method in this interface, and an exception is thrown. However, in
  Apache CXF prior the exception is caught in the reflection code and not properly
  propagated. What this means is that if you are using the `com.sun.net.ssl` stack
  with CXF, an error with TLS hostname verification will not be thrown, leaving a
  CXF client subject to man-in-the-middle attacks."
