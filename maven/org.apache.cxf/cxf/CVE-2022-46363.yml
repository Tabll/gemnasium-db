title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "A vulnerability in Apache CXF before versions 3.5.5 and 3.4.10 allows
  an attacker to perform a remote directory listing or code exfiltration. The vulnerability
  only applies when the CXFServlet is configured with both the static-resources-list
  and redirect-query-check attributes. These attributes are not supposed to be used
  together, and so the vulnerability can only arise if the CXF service is misconfigured."
