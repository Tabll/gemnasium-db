package_slug: "maven/org.apache.cxf/cxf-rt-rs-security-xml"
title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "CXF supports (via `JwtRequestCodeFilter`) passing OAuth 2 parameters
  via a JWT token as opposed to query parameters (see: The OAuth Authorization Framework:
  JWT Secured Authorization Request (JAR)). Instead of sending a JWT token as a `request`
  parameter, the spec also supports specifying a URI from which to retrieve a JWT
  token from via the `request_uri` parameter. CXF was not validating the `request_uri`
  parameter (apart from ensuring it uses https) and was making a REST request to the
  parameter in the request to retrieve a token. This means that CXF was vulnerable
  to DDos attacks on the authorization server, as specified in section of the spec."
