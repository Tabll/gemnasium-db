title: "Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions"
description: "It is possible to configure Apache CXF to use the com.sun.net.ssl implementation
  via 'System.setProperty(\"java.protocol.handler.pkgs\", \"com.sun.net.ssl.internal.www.protocol\");'.
  When this system property is set, CXF uses some reflection to try to make the HostnameVerifier
  work with the old com.sun.net.ssl.HostnameVerifier interface. However, the default
  HostnameVerifier implementation in CXF does not implement the method in this interface,
  and an exception is thrown. However, in Apache CXF prior to 3.2.5 and 3.1.16 the
  exception is caught in the reflection code and not properly propagated. What this
  means is that if you are using the com.sun.net.ssl stack with CXF, an error with
  TLS hostname verification will not be thrown, leaving a CXF client subject to man-in-the-middle
  attacks."
