identifier: "CVE-2016-6812"
package_slug: "maven/org.apache.cxf/cxf-rt-transports-http"
title: "Cross-site Scripting"
description: "The HTTP transport module in Apache CXF uses `FormattedServiceListWriter`
  to provide an HTML page which lists the names and absolute URL addresses of the
  available service endpoints. The module calculates the base URL using the current
  `HttpServletRequest` which is used by `FormattedServiceListWriter` to build the
  service endpoint absolute URLs. If the unexpected matrix parameters have been injected
  into the request URL then these matrix parameters will find their way back to the
  client in the services list page which represents an XSS risk to the client."
