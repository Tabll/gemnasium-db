package_slug: "maven/org.jsoup/jsoup"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "jsoup is a Java HTML parser, built for HTML editing, cleaning, scraping,
  and cross-site scripting (XSS) safety. jsoup may incorrectly sanitize HTML including
  `javascript:` URL expressions, which could allow XSS attacks when a reader subsequently
  clicks that link. If the non-default `SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks` option is
  enabled, HTML including `javascript:` URLs that have been crafted with control characters
  will not be sanitized. If the site that this HTML is published on does not set a
  Content Security Policy, an XSS attack is then possible. This issue is patched in
  jsoup 1.15.3. Users should upgrade to this version. Additionally, as the unsanitized
  input may have been persisted, old content should be cleaned again using the updated
  version. To remediate this issue without immediately upgrading: - disable `SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks`,
  which will rewrite input URLs as absolute URLs - ensure an appropriate [Content
  Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) is defined.
  (This should be used regardless of upgrading, as a defence-in-depth best practice.)"
