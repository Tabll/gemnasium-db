package_slug: "maven/org.jsoup/jsoup"
title: "Uncaught Exception"
description: "jsoup is a Java library for working with HTML. Those using jsoup to
  parse untrusted HTML or XML may be vulnerable to DoS attacks. If the parser is run
  on user supplied input, an attacker may supply content that causes the parser to
  get stuck (loop indefinitely until cancelled), to complete more slowly than usual,
  or to throw an unexpected exception. This effect may support a denial of service
  attack. The issue is patched There are a few available workarounds. Users may rate
  limit input parsing, limit the size of inputs based on system resources, and/or
  implement thread watchdogs to cap and timeout parse runtimes."
