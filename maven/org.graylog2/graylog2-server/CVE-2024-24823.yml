package_slug: "maven/org.graylog2/graylog2-server"
title: "Session Fixation"
description: "Graylog is a free and open log management platform. Starting in version
  4.3.0 and prior to versions 5.1.11 and 5.2.4, reauthenticating with an existing
  session cookie would re-use that session id, even if for different user credentials.
  In this case, the pre-existing session could be used to gain elevated access to
  an existing Graylog login session, provided the malicious user could successfully
  inject their session cookie into someone else's browser. The complexity of such
  an attack is high, because it requires presenting a spoofed login screen and injection
  of a session cookie into an existing browser, potentially through a cross-site scripting
  attack. No such attack has been discovered. Graylog 5.1.11 and 5.2.4, and any versions
  of the 6.0 development branch, contain patches to not re-use sessions under any
  circumstances. Some workarounds are available. Using short session expiration and
  explicit log outs of unused sessions can help limiting the attack vector. Unpatched
  this vulnerability exists, but is relatively hard to exploit. A proxy could be leveraged
  to clear the `authentication` cookie for the Graylog server URL for the `/api/system/sessions`
  endpoint, as that is the only one vulnerable."
