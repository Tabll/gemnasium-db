title: "Graylog Allows Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Files Plugin and API Browser"
description: "Two minor vulnerabilities were identified in the Graylog2 enterprise
  server, which can be combined to carry out a stored cross-site scripting attack.\nAn
  attacker with the permission `FILES_CREATE` can exploit these vulnerabilities to
  upload arbitrary Javascript code to the Graylog2 server, which - upon requesting
  of the file by a user of the API browser - results in the execution of this Javascript
  code in the context of the Graylog frontend application.\nThis enables the attacker
  to carry out authenticated API requests with the permissions of the logged-in user,
  thereby taking over the user session."
