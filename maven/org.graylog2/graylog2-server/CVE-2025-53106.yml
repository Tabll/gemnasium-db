title: "Graylog vulnerable to privilege escalation through API tokens"
description: "Graylog users can gain elevated privileges by creating and using API
  tokens for the local Administrator or any other user for whom the malicious user
  knows the ID.\n\nFor the attack to succeed, the attacker needs a user account in
  Graylog. They can then proceed to issue hand-crafted requests to the Graylog REST
  API and exploit a weak permission check for token creation."
