description: "It is possible to obtain user session cookies by submitting an HTML
  form as part of an Event Definition Remediation Step field.\nFor this attack to
  succeed, the attacker needs a user account with permissions to create event definitions,
  while the user must have permissions to view alerts. Additionally, an active Input
  must be present on the Graylog server that is capable of receiving form data (e.g.
  a HTTP input, TCP raw or syslog etc)."
