title: "Graylog user session is still usable after logout"
description: "### Summary\n\nIn a multi-node Graylog cluster, after a user has explicitly
  logged out, a user session may still be used for API requests until it has reached
  its original expiry time.\n\n### Details\n\nEach node maintains an in-memory cache
  of user sessions. Upon a cache-miss, the session is loaded from the database. After
  that, the node operates solely on the cached session. Modifications to sessions
  will update the cached version as well as the session persisted in the database.
  However, each node maintains their isolated version of the session.\n\nWhen the
  user logs out, the session is removed from the node-local cache and deleted from
  the database. The other nodes will however still use the cached session.\n\nThese
  nodes will only fail to accept the session id if they intent to update the session
  in the database. They will then notice that the session is gone. This is true for
  most API requests originating from user interaction with the Graylog UI because
  these will lead to an update of the session's \"last access\" timestamp.\n\nIf the
  session update is however prevented by setting the `X-Graylog-No-Session-Extension:true`
  header in the request, the node will consider the (cached) session valid until the
  session is expired according to its timeout setting.\n\n### PoC\nIn a 2-node setup,
  with both nodes behind a load balancer:\n\n1. Log in\n1. Extract the session ID
  from the cookie\n1. Log out and close the browser\n1. Perform the following API
  request repeatedly with curl (with `<session-id>` replaced with the session id from
  step 2 and `<lb-host>` replaced with the hostname of your load balancer):\n  ```\n
  \ curl -I -H X-Graylog-No-Session-Extension:true https://<session-id>:session@<lb-host>/api/system/cluster/nodes\n
  \ ```\n1. Notice that the request is sometimes rejected, but sometimes succeeds\n\n\n###
  Impact\n\nNo session identifiers are leaked.\n\nAfter a user has logged out, the
  UI shows the login screen again, which gives the user the impression that their
  session is not valid anymore. However, if the session becomes compromised later,
  it can still be used to perform API requests against the Graylog cluster. The time
  frame for this is limited to the configured session lifetime, starting from the
  time when the user logged out.\n\n\n"
