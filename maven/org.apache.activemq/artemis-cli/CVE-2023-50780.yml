title: "Apache ActiveMQ Artemis: Authenticated users could perform RCE via Jolokia
  MBeans"
description: "Apache ActiveMQ Artemis allows access to diagnostic information and
  controls through MBeans, which are also exposed through the authenticated Jolokia
  endpoint. Before version 2.29.0, this also included the Log4J2 MBean. This MBean
  is not meant for exposure to non-administrative users. This could eventually allow
  an authenticated attacker to write arbitrary files to the filesystem and indirectly
  achieve RCE.\n\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 2.29.0 or later, which
  fixes the issue."
