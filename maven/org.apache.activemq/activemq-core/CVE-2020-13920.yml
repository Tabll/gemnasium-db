identifier: "CVE-2020-13920"
package_slug: "maven/org.apache.activemq/activemq-core"
title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "Apache ActiveMQ uses `LocateRegistry.createRegistry()` to create the
  JMX RMI registry and binds the server to the `jmxrmi` entry. It is possible to connect
  to the registry without authentication and call the rebind method to rebind jmxrmi
  to something else. If an attacker creates another server to proxy the original,
  and bound that, he effectively becomes a man in the middle and is able to intercept
  the credentials when a user connects."
