title: "Apache ActiveMQ Artemis User Without Create Address Permissions can Modify
  Address Routing-Type"
description: "A vulnerability exists in Apache ActiveMQ Artemis whereby a user with
  the createDurableQueue or createNonDurableQueue permission on an address can augment
  the routing-type supported by that address even if said user doesn't have the createAddress
  permission for that particular address. When combined with the send permission and
  automatic queue creation a user could successfully send a message with a routing-type
  not supported by the address when that message should actually be rejected on the
  basis that the user doesn't have permission to change the routing-type of the address.\n\nThis
  issue affects Apache ActiveMQ Artemis from 2.0.0 through 2.39.0.\n\nUsers are recommended
  to upgrade to version 2.40.0 which fixes the issue."
