description: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site
  Scripting') vulnerability in Apache Archiva.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Archiva:
  from 2.0.0.\n\nAs this project is retired, we do not plan to release a version that
  fixes this issue. Users are recommended to find an alternative or restrict access
  to the instance to trusted users. Alternatively, you could configure a HTTP proxy
  in front of your Archiva instance to only forward requests that do not have malicious
  characters in the URL.\n\nNOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are
  no longer supported by the maintainer.\n\n"
