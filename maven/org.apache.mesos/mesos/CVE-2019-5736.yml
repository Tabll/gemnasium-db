identifier: "CVE-2019-5736"
package_slug: "maven/org.apache.mesos/mesos"
title: "Containment Errors (Container Errors)"
description: "runc allows attackers to overwrite the host runc binary (and consequently
  obtain host root access) by leveraging the ability to execute a command as root
  within one of these types of containers: (1) a new container with an attacker-controlled
  image, or (2) an existing container, to which the attacker previously had write
  access, that can be attached with docker exec. This occurs because of file-descriptor
  mishandling, related to `/proc/self/exe`."
