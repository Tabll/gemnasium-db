package_slug: "maven/io.github.karlatemp/unsafe-accessor"
title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "UnsafeAccessor (UA) is a bridge to access jdk.internal.misc.Unsafe &
  sun.misc.Unsafe. Normally, if UA is loaded as a named module, the internal data
  of UA is protected by JVM and others can only access UA via UA's standard API. The
  main application can set up `SecurityCheck.AccessLimiter` for UA to limit access
  to UA. Starting with version 1.4.0 and prior to version 1.7.0, when `SecurityCheck.AccessLimiter`
  is set up, untrusted code can access UA without limitation, even when UA is loaded
  as a named module. This issue does not affect those for whom `SecurityCheck.AccessLimiter`
  is not set up. Version 1.7.0 contains a patch."
