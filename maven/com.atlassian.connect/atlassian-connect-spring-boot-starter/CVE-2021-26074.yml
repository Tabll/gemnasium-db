package_slug: "maven/com.atlassian.connect/atlassian-connect-spring-boot-starter"
title: "Incorrect Authorization"
description: "Broken Authentication in Atlassian Connect Spring Boot (ACSB) from version
  1.1.0 before version 2.1.3: Atlassian Connect Spring Boot is a Java Spring Boot
  package for building Atlassian Connect apps. Authentication between Atlassian products
  and the Atlassian Connect Spring Boot app occurs with a server-to-server JWT or
  a context JWT. Atlassian Connect Spring Boot versions between 1.1.0 - 2.1.2 erroneously
  accept context JWTs in lifecycle endpoints (such as installation) where only server-to-server
  JWTs should be accepted, permitting an attacker to send authenticated re-installation
  events to an app."
