package_slug: "maven/org.apache.axis/axis"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "** UNSUPPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** ** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** When
  integrating Apache Axis 1.x in an application, it may not have been obvious that
  looking up a service through \"ServiceFactory.getService\" allows potentially dangerous
  lookup mechanisms such as LDAP. When passing untrusted input to this API method,
  this could expose the application to DoS, SSRF and even attacks leading to RCE.\n\nAs
  Axis 1 has been EOL we recommend you migrate to a different SOAP engine, such as
  Apache Axis 2/Java. As a workaround, you may review your code to verify no untrusted
  or unsanitized input is passed to \"ServiceFactory.getService\", or by applying
  the patch from https://github.com/apache/axis-axis1-java/commit/7e66753427466590d6def0125e448d2791723210
  . The Apache Axis project does not expect to create an Axis 1.x release fixing this
  problem, though contributors that would like to work towards this are welcome.\n\n"
