description: "** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** Improper Input Validation vulnerability
  in Apache Axis allowed users with access to the admin service to perform possible
  SSRF\nThis issue affects Apache Axis: through 1.3.\n\nAs Axis 1 has been EOL we
  recommend you migrate to a different SOAP engine, such as Apache Axis 2/Java. Alternatively
  you could use a build of Axis with the patch from https://github.com/apache/axis-axis1-java/commit/685c309febc64aa393b2d64a05f90e7eb9f73e06
  applied. The Apache Axis project does not expect to create an Axis 1.x release \nfixing
  this problem, though contributors that would like to work towards\n this are welcome.\n\n"
