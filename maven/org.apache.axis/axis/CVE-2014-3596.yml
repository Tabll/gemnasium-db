package_slug: "maven/org.apache.axis/axis"
title: "Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch"
description: "The `getCN` function in Apache Axis does not properly verify that the
  server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or `subjectAltName`
  field of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof
  SSL servers via a certificate with a subject that specifies a common name in a field
  that is not the `CN` field."
