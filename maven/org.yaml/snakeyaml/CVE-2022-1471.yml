title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "SnakeYaml's Constructor() class does not restrict types which can be
  instantiated during deserialization. Deserializing yaml content provided by an attacker
  can lead to remote code execution. We recommend using SnakeYaml's SafeConsturctor
  when parsing untrusted content to restrict deserialization."
