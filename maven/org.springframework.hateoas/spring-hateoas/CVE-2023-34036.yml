package_slug: "maven/org.springframework.hateoas/spring-hateoas"
title: "Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output"
description: "\nReactive web applications that use Spring HATEOAS to produce hypermedia-based
  responses might be exposed to malicious forwarded headers if they are not behind
  a trusted proxy that ensures correctness of such headers, or if they don't have
  anything else in place to handle (and possibly discard) forwarded headers either
  in WebFlux or at the level of the underlying HTTP server.\n\nFor the application
  to be affected, it needs to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n * It needs to
  use the reactive web stack (Spring WebFlux) and Spring HATEOAS to create links in
  hypermedia-based responses.\n * The application infrastructure does not guard against
  clients submitting (X-)Forwarded… headers.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
