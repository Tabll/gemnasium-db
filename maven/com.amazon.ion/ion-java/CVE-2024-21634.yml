package_slug: "maven/com.amazon.ion/ion-java"
title: "Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling"
description: "Amazon Ion is a Java implementation of the Ion data notation. Prior
  to version 1.10.5, a potential denial-of-service issue exists in `ion-java` for
  applications that use `ion-java` to deserialize Ion text encoded data, or deserialize
  Ion text or binary encoded data into the `IonValue` model and then invoke certain `IonValue` methods
  on that in-memory representation. An actor could craft Ion data that, when loaded
  by the affected application and/or processed using the `IonValue` model, results
  in a `StackOverflowError` originating from the `ion-java` library. The patch is
  included in `ion-java` 1.10.5. As a workaround, do not load data which originated
  from an untrusted source or that could have been tampered with."
