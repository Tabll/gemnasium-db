title: "WildFly Elytron: OIDC app attempting to access the second tenant, the user
  should be prompted to log"
description: "A flaw was found in JBoss EAP. When an OIDC app that serves multiple
  tenants attempts to access the second tenant, it should prompt the user to log in
  again since the second tenant is secured with a different OIDC configuration. The
  underlying issue is in OidcSessionTokenStore when determining if a cached token
  should be used or not. This logic needs to be updated to take into account the new
  \"provider-url\" option in addition to the \"realm\" option."
