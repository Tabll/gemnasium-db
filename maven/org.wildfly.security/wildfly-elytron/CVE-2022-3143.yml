title: "Wildfly-elytron possibly vulnerable to timing attacks via use of unsafe comparator"
description: "wildfly-elytron: possible timing attacks via use of unsafe comparator.
  A flaw was found in Wildfly-elytron. Wildfly-elytron uses java.util.Arrays.equals
  in several places, which is unsafe and vulnerable to timing attacks. To compare
  values securely, use java.security.MessageDigest.isEqual instead. This flaw allows
  an attacker to access secure information or impersonate an authed user."
