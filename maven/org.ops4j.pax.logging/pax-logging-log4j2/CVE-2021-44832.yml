package_slug: "maven/org.ops4j.pax.logging/pax-logging-log4j2"
title: "Improper Input Validation and Injection in Apache Log4j2"
description: "Apache Log4j2 versions 2.0-beta7 through 2.17.0 (excluding security
  fix releases 2.3.2 and 2.12.4) are vulnerable to an attack where an attacker with
  permission to modify the logging configuration file can construct a malicious configuration
  using a JDBC Appender with a data source referencing a JNDI URI which can execute
  remote code. This issue is fixed by limiting JNDI data source names to the java
  protocol in Log4j2 versions 2.17.1, 2.12.4, and 2.3.2."
