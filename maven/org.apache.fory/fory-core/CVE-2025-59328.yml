title: "Apache Fory Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability"
description: "A vulnerability in Apache Fory allows a remote attacker to cause a Denial
  of Service (DoS). The issue stems from the insecure deserialization of untrusted
  data. An attacker can supply a large, specially crafted data payload that, when
  processed, consumes an excessive amount of CPU resources during the deserialization
  process. This leads to CPU exhaustion, rendering the application or system using
  the Apache Fory library unresponsive and unavailable to legitimate users.\n\nUsers
  of Apache Fory are strongly advised to upgrade to version 0.12.2 or later to mitigate
  this vulnerability. Developers of libraries and applications that depend on Apache
  Fory should update their dependency requirements to Apache Fory 0.12.2 or later and
  release new versions of their software."
