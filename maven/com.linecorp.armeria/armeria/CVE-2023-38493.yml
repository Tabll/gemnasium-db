title: "Paths contain matrix variables bypass decorators"
description: "Armeria is a microservice framework Spring supports Matrix variables.
  When Spring integration is used, Armeria calls Spring controllers via `TomcatService`
  or `JettyService` with the path that may contain matrix variables. Prior to version
  1.24.3, the Armeria decorators might not invoked because of the matrix variables.
  If an attacker sends a specially crafted request, the request may bypass the authorizer.
  Version 1.24.3 contains a patch for this issue."
