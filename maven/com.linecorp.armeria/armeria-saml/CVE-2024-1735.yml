title: "Armeria SAML authentication bypass due to missing validation on unsigned SAML
  messages"
description: "### Impact\n\nThe SAML implementation provided by `armeria-saml` currently
  accepts unsigned SAML messages (assertions, logout requests, etc.) as they are,
  rather than rejecting them by default. As a result, an attacker can forge a SAML
  message to authenticate themselves, despite the fact that such an unsigned SAML
  message should be rejected.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability has been patched
  in Armeria version 1.27.2. All users who rely on `armeria-saml` older than version
  1.27.2 must upgrade to 1.27.2 or later.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no known
  workaround for this vulnerability.\n\n"
