package_slug: "maven/org.jboss.fuse/jboss-fuse"
title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor in JBoss Fuse"
description: "JBoss Fuse does not enable encrypted passwords by default in its usage
  of Apache Zookeeper. This permitted sensitive information disclosure via logging
  to local users. Note: this description has been updated; previous text mistakenly
  identified the source of the flaw as Zookeeper. Previous text: Apache Zookeeper
  logs cleartext admin passwords, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information
  by reading the log."
