package_slug: "maven/org.apache.jspwiki/jspwiki-war"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "A carefully crafted request on AJAXPreview.jsp could trigger an XSS
  vulnerability on Apache JSPWiki, which could allow the attacker to execute javascript
  in the victim's browser and get some sensitive information about the victim. This
  vulnerability leverages CVE-2021-40369, where the Denounce plugin dangerously renders
  user-supplied URLs. Upon re-testing CVE-2021-40369, it appears that the patch was
  incomplete as it was still possible to insert malicious input via the Denounce plugin.
  Apache JSPWiki users should upgrade to 2.11.3 or later."
