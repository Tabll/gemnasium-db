title: "Apache Shiro has an Authentication Bypass"
description: "**Authentication Bypass:**\nA vulnerability exists in Apache Shiro that
  allows authentication bypass for static files when served from a case-insensitive
  filesystem (such as the default configuration on macOS or Windows).\n\nThe issue
  arises when Shiro's URL filters are configured with lower-case rules (a common default),
  but the underlying operating system treats mixed-case filenames as identical. An
  attacker can access protected static resources by varying the capitalization of
  the filename in the request (e.g., requesting `/SECRET.TXT` to bypass a rule for
  `/secret.txt`).\n\nThis issue specifically affects static file handling and does
  not impact dynamic resource paths that are case-sensitive."
