title: "Apache Shiro Affected by an Observable Timing Discrepancy Vulnerability"
description: "Observable Timing Discrepancy vulnerability in Apache Shiro.\n\nThis
  issue affects Apache Shiro: from 1.*, 2.* before 2.0.7.\n\nUsers are recommended
  to upgrade to version 2.0.7 or later, which fixes the issue.\n\nPrior to Shiro 2.0.7,
  code paths for non-existent vs. existing users are different enough,\nthat a brute-force
  attack may be able to tell, by timing the requests only, determine if\nthe request
  failed because of a non-existent user vs. wrong password.\n\nThe most likely attack
  vector is a local attack only.\nShiro security model  https://shiro.apache.org/security-model.html#username_enumeration
   discusses this as well.\n\nTypically, brute force attack can be mitigated at the
  infrastructure level."
