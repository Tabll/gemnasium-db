title: "Deep Java Library path traversal issue"
description: "[Deep Java Library (DJL)](https://docs.djl.ai/master/index.html) is
  an open-source, high-level, engine-agnostic Java framework for deep learning. DJL
  is designed to be easy to get started with and simple to use for Java developers.
  DJL provides a native Java development experience and functions like any other regular
  Java library.\n\nDJL provides utilities for extracting tar and zip model archives
  that are used when loading models for use with DJL. These utilities were found to
  contain issues that do not protect against absolute path traversal during the extraction
  process."
