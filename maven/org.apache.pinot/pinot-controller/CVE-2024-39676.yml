title: "Apache Pinot: Unauthorized endpoint exposed sensitive information"
description: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability
  in Apache Pinot.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Pinot: from 0.1 before 1.0.0.\n\nUsers
  are recommended to upgrade to version 1.0.0Â and configure RBAC, which fixes the
  issue.\n\nDetails:\n\nWhen using a request to path `/appconfigs` to the controller,
  it can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information such as system information
  (e.g. arch, os version), environment information (e.g. maxHeapSize) and Pinot configurations
  (e.g. zookeeper path). This issue was addressed by the Role-based Access Control
  https://docs.pinot.apache.org/operators/tutorials/authentication/basic-auth-access-control
  , so that `/appConfigs` and all other APIs can be access controlled. Only authorized
  users have access to it. Note the user needs to add the admin role accordingly to
  the RBAC guide to control access to this endpoint, and in the future version of
  Pinot, a default admin role is planned to be added."
