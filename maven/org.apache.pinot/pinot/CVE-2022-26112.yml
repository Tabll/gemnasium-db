title: "Apache Pinot has Groovy Function support enabled by default"
description: "Pinot allows you to run any function using Apache Groovy scripts. In
  versions prior to 0.10.0, Pinot query endpoint and realtime ingestion layer has
  a vulnerability in unprotected environments due to groovy function support being
  enabled by default. This issue has been fixed by making function support disabled
  by default, in version 0.11.0. A potential workaround is to disable groovy script
  support."
