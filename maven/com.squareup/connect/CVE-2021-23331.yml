identifier: "CVE-2021-23331"
package_slug: "maven/com.squareup/connect"
title: "Insecure Temporary File"
description: "`prepareDownloadFilecreates` creates a temporary file with the permissions
  bits of -rw-r--r-- on unix-like systems. On unix-like systems, the system temporary
  directory is shared between users. As such, the contents of the file downloaded
  by `downloadFileFromResponse` will be visible to all other users on the local system.
  A workaround fix for this issue is to set the system property `java.io.tmpdir` to
  a safe directory as remediation. Note: This version of the SDK is end of life and
  no longer maintained, please upgrade to the latest version."
