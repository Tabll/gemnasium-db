description: "Arbitrary code execution due to incomplete sandbox protection: Constructors,
  instance variable initializers, and instance initializers in Pipeline scripts were
  not subject to sandbox protection, and could therefore execute arbitrary code. This
  could be exploited e.g. by regular Jenkins users with the permission to configure
  Pipelines in Jenkins, or by trusted committers to repositories containing Jenkinsfiles."
