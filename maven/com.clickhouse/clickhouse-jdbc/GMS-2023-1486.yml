title: "ClickHouse vulnerable to client certificate password exposure in client exception"
description: "### Summary\nAs initially reported in issue #1331, when client certificate
  authentication is enabled with password protection, the password (referred to as
  the client option `sslkey`) may be exposed in client exceptions (e.g., ClickHouseException
  or SQLException). This vulnerability can potentially lead to unauthorized access,
  data breaches, and violations of user privacy.\n\n### Details\nDuring the handling
  of ClickHouseException, the client certificate password may be inadvertently exposed
  when sslkey is specified. This issue can arise when an exception is thrown during
  the execution of a query or a database operation. The client certificate password
  is then included in the exception message, which could be logged or exposed to unauthorized
  parties.\n\n### Impact\nThis vulnerability enables an attacker with access to client
  exception error messages or logs to obtain client certificate passwords, potentially
  allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information, data manipulation, and denial
  of service attacks. The extent of the risk depends on the specific implementation
  and usage of the affected systems. However, any exposure of client certificate passwords
  should be treated as a high-priority security concern.\n"
