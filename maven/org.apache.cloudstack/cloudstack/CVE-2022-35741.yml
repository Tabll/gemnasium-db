package_slug: "maven/org.apache.cloudstack/cloudstack"
title: "Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference"
description: "Apache CloudStack version 4.5.0 and later has a SAML 2.0 authentication
  Service Provider plugin which is found to be vulnerable to XML external entity (XXE)
  injection. This plugin is not enabled by default and the attacker would require
  that this plugin be enabled to exploit the vulnerability. When the SAML 2.0 plugin
  is enabled in affected versions of Apache CloudStack could potentially allow the
  exploitation of XXE vulnerabilities. The SAML 2.0 messages constructed during the
  authentication flow in Apache CloudStack are XML-based and the XML data is parsed
  by various standard libraries that are now understood to be vulnerable to XXE injection
  attacks such as arbitrary file reading, possible denial of service, server-side
  request forgery (SSRF) on the CloudStack management server."
