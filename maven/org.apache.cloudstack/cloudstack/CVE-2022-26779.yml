package_slug: "maven/org.apache.cloudstack/cloudstack"
title: "Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)"
description: "Apache CloudStack prior to 4.16.1.0 used insecure random number generation
  for project invitation tokens. If a project invite is created based only on an email
  address, a random token is generated. An attacker with knowledge of the project
  ID and the fact that the invite is sent, could generate time deterministic tokens
  and brute force attempt to use them prior to the legitimate receiver accepting the
  invite. This feature is not enabled by default, the attacker is required to know
  or guess the project ID for the invite in addition to the invitation token, and
  the attacker would need to be an existing authorized user of CloudStack."
