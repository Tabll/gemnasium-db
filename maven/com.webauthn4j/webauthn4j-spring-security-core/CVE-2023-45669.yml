package_slug: "maven/com.webauthn4j/webauthn4j-spring-security-core"
title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "WebAuthn4J Spring Security provides Web Authentication specification
  support for Spring applications. Affected versions are subject to improper signature
  counter value handling. A flaw was found in webauthn4j-spring-security-core. When
  an authneticator returns an incremented signature counter value during authentication,
  webauthn4j-spring-security-core does not properly persist the value, which means
  cloned authenticator detection does not work. An attacker who cloned valid authenticator
  in some way can use the cloned authenticator without being detected. This issue
  has been addressed in version `0.9.1.RELEASE`. Users are advised to upgrade. There
  are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n"
