package_slug: "maven/org.graniteds/granite-server-core"
title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "The Java implementation of AMF3 deserializers used in GraniteDS, version
  3.1.1.G, may allow instantiation of arbitrary classes via their public parameter-less
  constructor and subsequently call arbitrary Java Beans setter methods. The ability
  to exploit this vulnerability depends on the availability of classes in the class
  path that make use of deserialization. A remote attacker with the ability to spoof
  or control information may be able to send serialized Java objects with pre-set
  properties that result in arbitrary code execution when deserialized."
