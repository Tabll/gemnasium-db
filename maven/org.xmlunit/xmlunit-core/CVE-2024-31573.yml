title: "XMLUnit for Java has Insecure Defaults when Processing XSLT Stylesheets"
description: "When performing XSLT transformations XMLUnit for Java did not disable
  XSLT extension functions by default. Depending on the XSLT processor being used
  this could allow arbitrary code to be executed when XMLUnit is used to transform
  data with a stylesheet who's source can not be trusted. If the stylesheet can be
  provided externally this may even lead to a remote code execution."
