description: "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
  for applications built on top of it. In versions prior to 11.10.13, 12.6.7, and
  12.10.2, a user disabled on a wiki using email verification for registration canouldre-activate
  themself by using the activation link provided for his registration. The problem
  has been patched in the following versions of XWiki: 11.10.13, 12.6.7, 12.10.2,
  13.0. It is possible to workaround the issue by resetting the `validkey` property
  of the disabled XWiki users. This can be done by editing the user profile with object
  editor."
