  XWiki projects. Starting in version 3.1-milestone-1, any user can edit their own
  profile and inject code, which is going to be executed with programming right. The
  same vulnerability can also be exploited in all other places where short text properties
  are displayed, e.g., in apps created using Apps Within Minutes that use a short
  text field. The problem has been patched on versions 13.10.9, 14.4.4, 14.7RC1."
