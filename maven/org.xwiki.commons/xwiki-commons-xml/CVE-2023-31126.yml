package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.commons/xwiki-commons-xml"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Invalid Characters in Identifiers in Web Pages"
description: "`org.xwiki.commons:xwiki-commons-xml` is an XML library used by the
  open-source wiki platform XWiki. The HTML sanitizer, introduced in version 14.6-rc-1,
  allows the injection of arbitrary HTML code and thus cross-site scripting via invalid
  data attributes. This vulnerability does not affect restricted cleaning in HTMLCleaner
  as there attributes are cleaned and thus characters like `/` and `>` are removed
  in all attribute names. This problem has been patched in XWiki 14.10.4 and 15.0
  RC1 by making sure that data attributes only contain allowed characters. There are
  no known workarounds apart from upgrading to a version including the fix."
