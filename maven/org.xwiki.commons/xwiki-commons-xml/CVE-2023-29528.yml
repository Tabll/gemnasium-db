title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "XWiki Commons are technical libraries common to several other top level
  XWiki projects. The \"restricted\" mode of the HTML cleaner in XWiki, introduced
  in version 4.2-milestone-1 and massively improved in version 14.6-rc-1, allowed
  the injection of arbitrary HTML code and thus cross-site scripting via invalid HTML
  comments. As a consequence, any code relying on this \"restricted\" mode for security
  is vulnerable to JavaScript injection (\"cross-site scripting\"/XSS). When a privileged
  user with programming rights visits such a comment in XWiki, the malicious JavaScript
  code is executed in the context of the user session. This allows server-side code
  execution with programming rights, impacting the confidentiality, integrity and
  availability of the XWiki instance. This problem has been patched in XWiki 14.10,
  HTML comments are now removed in restricted mode and a check has been introduced
  that ensures that comments don't start with `>`. There are no known workarounds
  apart from upgrading to a version including the fix.\n"
