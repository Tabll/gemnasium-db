title: "Elasticsearch Incorrect Authorization vulnerability"
description: "Incorrect Authorization issue exists in the API key based security model
  for Remote Cluster Security, which is currently in Beta, in Elasticsearch 8.10.0
  and before 8.13.0. This allows aÂ malicious user with a valid API key for a remote
  cluster configured to use the new Remote Cluster Security to read arbitrary documents
  from any index on the remote cluster, and only if they use the Elasticsearch custom
  transport protocol to issue requests with the target index ID, the shard ID and
  the document ID. None of Elasticsearch REST API endpoints are affected by this issue."
