package_slug: "maven/org.elasticsearch/elasticsearch"
title: "Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference"
description: "Elasticsearch Security versions 6.5.0 and 6.5.1 contain an XXE flaw
  in Machine Learning's find_file_structure API. If a policy allowing external network
  access has been added to Elasticsearch's Java Security Manager then an attacker
  could send a specially crafted request capable of leaking content of local files
  on the Elasticsearch node. This could allow a user to access information that they
  should not have access to."
