title: "Improper Privilege Management"
description: "In Elasticsearch before 7.9.0 and 6.8.12 a field disclosure flaw was
  found when running a scrolling search with Field Level Security. If a user runs
  the same query another more privileged user recently ran, the scrolling search can
  leak fields that should be hidden. This could result in an attacker gaining additional
  permissions against a restricted index."
