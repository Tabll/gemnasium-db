description: "A document disclosure flaw was found in Elasticsearch versions after
  7.6.0 and before 7.11.0 when Document or Field Level Security is used. Get requests
  do not properly apply security permissions when executing a query against a recently
  updated document. This affects documents that have been updated and not yet refreshed
  in the index. This could result in the search disclosing the existence of documents
  and fields the attacker should not be able to view."
