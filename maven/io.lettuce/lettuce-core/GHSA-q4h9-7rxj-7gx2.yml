  i don't want to broadcast vulnerabilities.\n\n> An unsafe reading of environment
  file could potentially cause a denial of service in Netty. When loaded on an Windows
  application, Netty attempts to load a file that does not exist. If an attacker creates
  such a large file, the Netty application crashes. This vulnerability is fixed in
  4.1.115."
