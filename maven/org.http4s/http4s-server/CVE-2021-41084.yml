package_slug: "maven/org.http4s/http4s-server"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream
  Component ('Injection')"
description: "http4s is an open source scala interface for HTTP. In affected versions
  http4s is vulnerable to response-splitting or request-splitting attacks when untrusted
  user input is used to create any of the following fields: Header names (`Header.name`Ã¥),
  Header values (`Header.value`), Status reason phrases (`Status.reason`), URI paths
  (`Uri.Path`), URI authority registered names (`URI.RegName`) (through 0.21). This
  issue has been resolved in versions 0.21.30, 0.22.5, 0.23.4, and 1.0.0-M27 perform
  the following. As a matter of practice http4s services and client applications should
  sanitize any user input in the aforementioned fields before returning a request
  or response to the backend. The carriage return, newline, and null characters are
  the most threatening."
