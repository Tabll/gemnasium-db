package_slug: "maven/org.http4s/http4s-server"
title: "Origin Validation Error"
description: "Http4s is a minimal, idiomatic Scala interface for HTTP services. In
  http4s versions 0.21.26 and prior, 0.22.0 through 0.22.2, 0.23.0, 0.23.1, and 1.0.0-M1
  through 1.0.0-M24, the default CORS configuration is vulnerable to an origin reflection
  attack. The middleware is also susceptible to a Null Origin Attack. The problem
  is fixed in 0.21.27, 0.22.3, 0.23.2, and 1.0.0-M25. The original `CORS` implementation
  and `CORSConfig` are deprecated. See the GitHub GHSA for more information, including
  code examples and workarounds."
