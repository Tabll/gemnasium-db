identifier: "CVE-2021-32643"
package_slug: "maven/org.http4s/http4s-core_2.12"
title: "Path Traversal"
description: "Http4s is a Scala interface for HTTP services. `StaticFile.fromUrl`
  can leak the presence of a directory on a server when the `URL` scheme is not `file://`,
  and the URL points to a fetchable resource under its scheme and authority. The function
  returns `F[None]`, indicating no resource, if `url.getFile` is a directory, without
  first checking the scheme or authority of the URL. If a URL connection to the scheme
  and URL would return a stream, and the path in the URL exists as a directory on
  the server, the presence of the directory on the server could be inferred from the
  response. The contents and other metadata about the directory are not exposed."
