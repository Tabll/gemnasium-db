package_slug: "maven/org.http4s/http4s-server_2.11"
title: "Default CORS config allows any origin with credentials"
description: "Http4s is a minimal, idiomatic Scala interface for HTTP services. In http4s versions 0.21.26 
  and prior, 0.22.0 through 0.22.2, 0.23.0, 0.23.1, and 1.0.0-M1 through 1.0.0-M24, the default CORS 
  configuration is vulnerable to an origin reflection attack. The middleware is also susceptible 
  to a Null Origin Attack. The problem is fixed in 0.21.27, 0.22.3, 0.23.2, and 1.0.0-M25. 
  The original `CORS` implementation and `CORSConfig` are deprecated. See the GitHub GHSA for
  more information, including code examples and workarounds."
