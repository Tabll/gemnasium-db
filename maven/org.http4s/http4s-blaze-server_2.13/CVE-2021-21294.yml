title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "Http4s (http4s-blaze-server) is a minimal, idiomatic Scala interface
  for HTTP services. Http4s before versions 0.21.17, 0.22.0-M2, and 1.0.0-M14 have
  a vulnerability which can lead to a denial-of-service. Blaze-core, a library underlying
  http4s-blaze-server, accepts connections unboundedly on its selector pool. This
  has the net effect of amplifying degradation in services that are unable to handle
  their current request load, since incoming connections are still accepted and added
  to an unbounded queue. Each connection allocates a socket handle, which drains a
  scarce OS resource. This can also confound higher level circuit breakers which work
  based on detecting failed connections. http4s provides a general \"MaxActiveRequests\"
  middleware mechanism for limiting open connections, but it is enforced inside the
  Blaze accept loop, after the connection is accepted and the socket opened. Thus,
  the limit only prevents the number of connections which can be simultaneously processed,
  not the number of connections which can be held open. In 0.21.17, 0.22.0-M2, and
  1.0.0-M14, a new \"maxConnections\" property, with a default value of 1024, has
  been added to the `BlazeServerBuilder`. Setting the value to a negative number restores
  unbounded behavior, but is strongly disrecommended. The NIO2 backend does not respect
  `maxConnections`. Its use is now deprecated in http4s-0.21, and the option is removed
  altogether starting in http4s-0.22. There are several possible workarounds described
  in the refrenced GitHub Advisory GHSA-xhv5-w9c5-2r2w."
