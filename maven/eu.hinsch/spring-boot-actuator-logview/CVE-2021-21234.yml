title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "spring-boot-actuator-logview in a library that adds a simple logfile
  viewer as spring boot actuator endpoint. It is maven package \"eu.hinsch:spring-boot-actuator-logview\".
  In spring-boot-actuator-logview before version 0.2.13 there is a directory traversal
  vulnerability. The nature of this library is to expose a log file directory via
  admin (spring boot actuator) HTTP endpoints. Both the filename to view and a base
  folder (relative to the logging folder root) can be specified via request parameters.
  While the filename parameter was checked to prevent directory traversal exploits
  (so that `filename=../somefile` would not work), the base folder parameter was not
  sufficiently checked, so that `filename=somefile&base=../` could access a file outside
  the logging base directory). The vulnerability has been patched in release 0.2.13.
  Any users of 0.2.12 should be able to update without any issues as there are no
  other changes in that release. There is no workaround to fix the vulnerability other
  than updating or removing the dependency. However, removing read access of the user
  the application is run with to any directory not required for running the application
  can limit the impact. Additionally, access to the logview endpoint can be limited
  by deploying the application behind a reverse proxy."
