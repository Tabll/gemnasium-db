package_slug: "maven/org.jenkins-ci.plugins/credentials-binding"
title: "Insufficiently Protected Credentials"
description: "Jenkins Credentials Binding Plugin 1.14 and earlier masks passwords
  it provides to build processes in their build logs. Jenkins however transforms provided
  password values, e.g. replacing environment variable references, which could result
  in values different from but similar to configured passwords being provided to the
  build. Those values are not subject to masking, and could allow unauthorized users
  to recover the original password."
