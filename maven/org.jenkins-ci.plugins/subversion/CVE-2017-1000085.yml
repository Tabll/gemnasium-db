identifier: "CVE-2017-1000085"
package_slug: "maven/org.jenkins-ci.plugins/subversion"
title: "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
description: "Subversion Plugin connects to a user-specified Subversion repository
  as part of form validation. This functionality improperly checked permissions, allowing
  any user with `Item/Build` permission (but not `Item/Configure`) to connect to any
  web server or Subversion server and send credentials with a known ID, thereby possibly
  capturing them. Additionally, this functionality did not require POST requests be
  used, thereby allowing the above to be performed without direct access to Jenkins
  via Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks."
