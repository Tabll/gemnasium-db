identifier: "CVE-2017-1000091"
package_slug: "maven/org.jenkins-ci.plugins/github-branch-source"
title: "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
description: "GitHub Branch Source Plugin connects to a user-specified GitHub API
  URL as part of form validation and completion. This functionality improperly checked
  permissions, allowing any user with `Overall/Read` access to Jenkins to connect
  to any web server and send credentials with a known ID, thereby possibly capturing
  them. Additionally, this functionality did not require POST requests be used, thereby
  allowing the above to be performed without direct access to Jenkins via Cross-Site
  Request Forgery."
