  job configuration form"
description: "Jenkins Curseforge Publisher Plugin 1.0 and earlier stores API Keys
  unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.\n\nThese
  keys can be viewed by users with Item/Extended Read permission or access to the
  Jenkins controller file system.\n\nAdditionally, the job configuration form does

  them.\n\nAs of publication of this advisory, there is no fix."
