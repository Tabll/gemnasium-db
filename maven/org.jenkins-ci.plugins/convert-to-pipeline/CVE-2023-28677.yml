title: "Jenkins Convert To Pipeline Plugin vulnerable to command injection"
description: "Jenkins Convert To Pipeline Plugin 1.0 and earlier uses basic string
  concatenation to convert Freestyle projects' Build Environment, Build Steps, and
  Post-build Actions to the equivalent Pipeline step invocations.\n\nThis allows attackers
  able to configure Freestyle projects to prepare a crafted configuration that injects
  Pipeline script code into the (unsandboxed) Pipeline resulting from a conversion
  by Convert To Pipeline Plugin. If an administrator converts the Freestyle project
  to a Pipeline, the script will be pre-approved."
