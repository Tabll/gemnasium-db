title: "Improper handling of case sensitivity in Jenkins OpenId Connect Authentication
  Plugin "
description: "The Jenkins OpenId Connect Authentication Plugin 4.452.v2849b_d3945fa_
  and earlier treats usernames as case-insensitive.\n\nOn a Jenkins instance configured
  with a case-sensitive OpenID Connect provider, this allows attackers to log in as
  any user by providing a username that differs only in letter case, potentially gaining
  administrator access to Jenkins.\n\nOpenId Connect Authentication Plugin 4.453.v4d7765c854f4
  introduces an advanced configuration option to manage username case sensitivity,
  with default to case-sensitive."
