title: "Arbitrary file read vulnerability in Git server Plugin can lead to RCE"
description: "Jenkins Git server Plugin uses the [args4j](https://github.com/kohsuke/args4j)
  library to parse command arguments and options on the Jenkins controller when processing
  Git commands received via SSH. This command parser has a feature that replaces an
  @ character followed by a file path in an argument with the fileâ€™s contents (`expandAtFiles`).
  This feature is enabled by default and Git server Plugin 99.va_0826a_b_cdfa_d and
  earlier does not disable it.\n\nThis allows attackers with Overall/Read permission
  to read the first two lines of arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system
  using the default character encoding of the Jenkins controller process.\n\nSee [SECURITY-3314](https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2024-01-24/#SECURITY-3314)
  for further information about the potential impact of being able to read files on
  the Jenkins controller, as well as the [limitations for reading binary files](https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2024-01-24/#binary-files-note).
  Note that for this issue, unlike SECURITY-3314, attackers need Overall/Read permission."
