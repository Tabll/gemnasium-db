package_slug: "maven/org.jenkins-ci.plugins/config-file-provider"
title: "Improper Privilege Management"
description: "The Config File Provider Plugin is used to centrally manage configuration
  files that often include secrets, such as passwords. Users with only Overall/Read
  access to Jenkins were able to access URLs directly that allowed viewing these files.
  Access to view these files now requires sufficient permissions to configure the
  provided files, view the configuration of the folder in which the configuration
  files are defined, or have Job/Configure permissions to a job able to use these
  files."
