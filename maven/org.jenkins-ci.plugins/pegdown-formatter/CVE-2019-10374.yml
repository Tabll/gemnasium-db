title: "Jenkins PegDown Formatter Plugin has Cross-site Scripting vulnerability"
description: "PegDown Formatter Plugin uses the PegDown library to implement support
  for rendering Markdown formatted descriptions in Jenkins. It advertises disabling
  of HTML to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) as a feature.\n\nPegDown Formatter
  Plugin does not prevent the use of `javascript:` scheme in URLs for links. This
  results in an XSS vulnerability exploitable by users able to configure entities
  with descriptions or similar properties that are rendered by the configured markup
  formatter.\n\nAs of publication of this advisory, there is no fix."
