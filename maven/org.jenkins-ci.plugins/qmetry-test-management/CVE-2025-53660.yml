title: "Jenkins QMetry Test Management Plugin vulnerability exposes API keys"
description: "QMetry Test Management Plugin 1.13 and earlier stores Qmetry Automation
  API Keys unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller as part
  of its configuration.\n\nThese API keys can be viewed by users with Item/Extended
  Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.\n\nAdditionally,
  the job configuration form does not mask these API keys, increasing the potential
  for attackers to observe and capture them.\n\nAs of publication of this advisory,
  there is no fix."
