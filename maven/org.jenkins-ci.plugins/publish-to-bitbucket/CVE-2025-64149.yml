  check"
description: "Jenkins Publish to Bitbucket Plugin 0.4 and earlier does not perform
  a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.\n\nThis allows attackers with Overall/Read
  permission to connect to an attacker-specified HTTP URL using attacker-specified
  credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in
  Jenkins.\n\nAdditionally, this endpoint does not require POST requests, resulting
  in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.\n\nAs of publication of this
  advisory, there is no fix."
