title: "Jenkins Templating Engine Plugin Vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution"
description: "Jenkins Templating Engine Plugin allows defining libraries both in the
  global configuration, as well as scoped to folders containing the pipelines using
  them. While libraries in the global configuration can only be set up by administrators
  and can therefore be trusted, libraries defined in folders can be configured by
  users with Item/Configure permission.\n\nIn Templating Engine Plugin 2.5.3 and earlier,
  libraries defined in folders are not subject to sandbox protection. This vulnerability
  allows attackers with Item/Configure permission to execute arbitrary code in the
  context of the Jenkins controller JVM.\n\nIn Templating Engine Plugin 2.5.4, libraries
  defined in folders are subject to sandbox protection."
