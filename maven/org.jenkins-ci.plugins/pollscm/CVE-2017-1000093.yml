identifier: "CVE-2017-1000093"
package_slug: "maven/org.jenkins-ci.plugins/pollscm"
title: "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
description: "The Poll SCM Plugin was not requiring requests to its API be sent via
  POST, thereby opening itself to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. This allowed
  attackers to initiate polling of projects with a known name. While Jenkins in general
  does not consider polling to be a protection-worthy action as it's similar to cache
  invalidation, the plugin specifically adds a permission to be able to use this functionality,
  and this issue undermines that permission."
