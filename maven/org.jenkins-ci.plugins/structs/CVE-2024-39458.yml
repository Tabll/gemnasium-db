title: "Exposure of secrets through system log in Jenkins Structs Plugin"
description: "Structs Plugin provides utility functionality used, e.g., in Pipeline
  to instantiate and configure build steps, typically before their execution.\n\nWhen
  Structs Plugin 337.v1b_04ea_4df7c8 and earlier fails to configure a build step,
  it logs a warning message containing diagnostic information that may contain secrets
  passed as step parameters.\n\nThis can result in accidental exposure of secrets
  through the default system log.\n\nStructs Plugin 338.v848422169819 inspects the
  types of actual parameters before logging these warning messages, and limits detailed
  diagnostic information to FINE level log messages if secrets are involved. These
  log messages are not displayed in the default Jenkins system log."
