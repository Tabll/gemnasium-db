title: "Jenkins Role-based Authorization Strategy Plugin grants permissions even after
  they’ve been disabled"
description: "Permissions in Jenkins can be enabled and disabled. Some permissions
  are disabled by default, e.g., Overall/Manage or Item/Extended Read. Disabled permissions
  cannot be granted directly, only through greater permissions that imply them (e.g.,
  Overall/Administer or Item/Configure).\n\nRole-based Authorization Strategy Plugin
  587.v2872c41fa_e51 and earlier grants permissions even after they’ve been disabled.\n\nThis
  allows attackers to have greater access than they’re entitled to after the following
  operations took place:\n\nA permission is granted to attackers directly or through
  groups.\n\nThe permission is disabled, e.g., through the script console.\n\nRole-based
  Authorization Strategy Plugin 587.588.v850a_20a_30162 does not grant disabled permissions."
