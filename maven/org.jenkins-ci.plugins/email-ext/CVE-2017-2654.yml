package_slug: "maven/org.jenkins-ci.plugins/email-ext"
title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "jenkins-email-ext before version 2.57.1 is vulnerable to an Information
  Exposure. The Email Extension Plugins is able to send emails to a dynamically created
  list of users based on the changelogs, like authors of SCM changes since the last
  successful build. This could in some cases result in emails being sent to people
  who have no user account in Jenkins, and in rare cases even people who were not
  involved in whatever project was being built, due to some mapping based on the local-part
  of email addresses."
