title: "Incorrect permission check in Jenkins GitLab Plugin allows enumerating credentials
  IDs "
description: "The Jenkins GitLab Plugin 1.9.6 and earlier does not correctly perform
  a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.\n\nThis allows attackers with global Item/Configure
  permission (while lacking Item/Configure permission on any particular job) to enumerate
  credential IDs of GitLab API token credentials and Secret text credentials stored
  in Jenkins. Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using
  another vulnerability.\n\nAn enumeration of credential IDs in GitLab Plugin 1.9.7
  requires Overall/Administer permission."
