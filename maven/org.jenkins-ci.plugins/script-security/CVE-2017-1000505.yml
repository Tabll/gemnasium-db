identifier: "CVE-2017-1000505"
package_slug: "maven/org.jenkins-ci.plugins/script-security"
title: "Information Exposure"
description: "Users with the ability to configure sandboxed Groovy scripts are able
  to use a type coercion feature in Groovy to create new `File` objects from strings.
  This allowed reading arbitrary files on the Jenkins master file system. Such a type
  coercion is now subject to sandbox protection and considered to be a call to the
  `new File(String)` constructor for the purpose of in-process script approval."
