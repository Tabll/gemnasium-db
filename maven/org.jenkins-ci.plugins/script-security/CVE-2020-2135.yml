title: "Sandbox bypass vulnerability in Script Security Plugin"
description: "Sandbox protection in Script Security Plugin 1.70 and earlier can be
  circumvented through:\n- Crafted constructor calls and bodies (due to an incomplete
  fix of [SECURITY-582](https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2017-08-07/#super-constructor-calls))\n-
  Crafted method calls on objects that implement `GroovyInterceptable`\n\nThis allows
  attackers able to specify and run sandboxed scripts to execute arbitrary code in
  the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.\n\nScript Security Plugin 1.71 has additional
  restrictions and sanity checks to ensure that super constructors cannot be constructed
  without being intercepted by the sandbox. In addition, it also intercepts method
  calls on objects that implement `GroovyInterceptable` as calls to `GroovyObject#invokeMethod(String,
  Object)`, which is on the list of dangerous signatures and should not be approved
  for use in the sandbox."
