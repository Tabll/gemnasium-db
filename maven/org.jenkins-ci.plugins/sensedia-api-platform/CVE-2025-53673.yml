title: "Jenkins Sensedia API Platform Plugin vulnerability exposes unencrypted tokens
  in its global configuration file"
description: "Jenkins Sensedia Api Platform tools Plugin 1.0 stores the Sensedia API
  Manager integration token unencrypted in its global configuration file `com.sensedia.configuration.SensediaApiConfiguration.xml`
  on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.\n\nThis token can be viewed
  by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.\n\nAdditionally, the
  global configuration form does not mask the token, increasing the potential for
  attackers to observe and capture it.\n\nAs of publication of this advisory, there
  is no fix."
