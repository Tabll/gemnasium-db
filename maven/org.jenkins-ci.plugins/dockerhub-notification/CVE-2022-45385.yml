title: "Lack of authentication mechanism for webhook in CloudBees Docker Hub/Registry
  Notification Plugin"
description: "CloudBees Docker Hub/Registry Notification Plugin provides several webhook
  endpoints that can be used to trigger builds when Docker images used by a job have
  been rebuilt.\n\nIn CloudBees Docker Hub/Registry Notification Plugin 2.6.2 and
  earlier, these endpoints can be accessed without authentication.\n\nThis allows
  unauthenticated attackers to trigger builds of jobs corresponding to the attacker-specified
  repository.\n\nCloudBees Docker Hub/Registry Notification Plugin 2.6.2.1 requires
  a token as a part of webhook URLs, which will act as authentication for the webhook
  endpoint. As a result, all webhook URLs in the plugin will be different after updating
  the plugin.\n\nAdministrators can set the [Java system](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/system-properties/)
  property `org.jenkinsci.plugins.registry.notification.webhook.JSONWebHook.DO_NOT_REQUIRE_API_TOKEN`
  to `true` to disable this fix."
