title: "Missing permission check in Jenkins Dimensions Plugin allows enumerating credentials
  IDs"
description: "Dimensions Plugin 0.9.3 and earlier does not perform a permission check
  in an HTTP endpoint.\n\nThis allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate
  credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. Those can be used as part of an
  attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.\n\nAn enumeration
  of credentials IDs in Dimensions Plugin 0.9.3.1 requires the appropriate permissions."
