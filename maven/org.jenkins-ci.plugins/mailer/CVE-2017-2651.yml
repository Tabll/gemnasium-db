description: "jenkins-mailer-plugin before version 1.20 is vulnerable to an information
  disclosure while using the feature to send emails to a dynamically created list
  of users based on the changelogs. This could in some cases result in emails being
  sent to people who have no user account in Jenkins, and in rare cases even people
  who were not involved in whatever project was being built, due to some mapping based
  on the local-part of email addresses."
