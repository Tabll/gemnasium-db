identifier: "CVE-2017-1000387"
package_slug: "maven/org.jenkins-ci.plugins/build-publisher"
title: "Insufficiently Protected Credentials"
description: "Jenkins Build-Publisher stores credentials to other Jenkins instances
  in the file `hudson.plugins.build_publisher.BuildPublisher.xml` in the Jenkins master
  home directory. These credentials were stored unencrypted, allowing anyone with
  local file system access to access them. Additionally, the credentials were also
  transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form. This could result in
  exposure of the credentials through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities,
  and similar situations."
