title: "Jenkins Credentials plugin reveals encrypted values of credentials to users
  with Extended Read permission"
description: "Jenkins Credentials Plugin 1380.va_435002fa_924 and earlier, except
  1371.1373.v4eb_fa_b_7161e9, does not redact encrypted values of credentials using
  the `SecretBytes` type (e.g., Certificate credentials, or Secret file credentials
  from Plain Credentials Plugin) when accessing item `config.xml` via REST API or
  CLI.\n\nThis allows attackers with Item/Extended Read permission to view encrypted
  `SecretBytes` values in credentials.\n\nThis issue is similar to SECURITY-266 in
  the 2016-05-11 security advisory, which applied to the `Secret` type used for inline
  secrets and some credentials types.\n\nCredentials Plugin 1381.v2c3a_12074da_b_
  redacts the encrypted values of credentials using the `SecretBytes` type in item
  `config.xml` files.\n\nThis fix is only effective on Jenkins 2.479 and newer, LTS
  2.462.3 and newer. While Credentials Plugin 1381.v2c3a_12074da_b_ can be installed
  on Jenkins 2.463 through 2.478 (both inclusive), encrypted values of credentials
  using the `SecretBytes` type will not be redacted when accessing item `config.xml`
  via REST API or CLI."
