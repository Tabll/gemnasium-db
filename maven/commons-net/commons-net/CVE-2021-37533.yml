package_slug: "maven/commons-net/commons-net"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "Prior to Apache Commons Net 3.9.0, Net's FTP client trusts the host
  from PASV response by default. A malicious server can redirect the Commons Net code
  to use a different host, but the user has to connect to the malicious server in
  the first place. This may lead to leakage of information about services running
  on the private network of the client. The default in version 3.9.0 is now false
  to ignore such hosts, as cURL does. See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NET-711."
