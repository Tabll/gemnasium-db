title: "Incorrect Authorization"
description: "OpenSearch is open-source software suite for search, analytics, and
  observability applications. Prior to versions 1.3.10 and 2.7.0, there is an issue
  with the implementation of fine-grained access control rules (document-level security,
  field-level security and field masking) where they are not correctly applied to
  the queries during extremely rare race conditions potentially leading to incorrect
  access authorization. For this issue to be triggered, two concurrent requests need
  to land on the same instance exactly when query cache eviction happens, once every
  four hours. OpenSearch 1.3.10 and 2.7.0 contain a fix for this issue."
