title: "Incorrect Authorization"
description: "OpenSearch is a community-driven, open source fork of Elasticsearch
  and Kibana. There is an issue with the implementation of fine-grained access control
  rules (document-level security, field-level security and field masking) where they
  are not correctly applied to the indices that back data streams potentially leading
  to incorrect access authorization. OpenSearch 1.3.7 and 2.4.0 contain a fix for
  this issue. Users are advised to update. There are no known workarounds for this
  issue."
