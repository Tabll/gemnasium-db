title: "Field-level security issue with .keyword fields in OpenSearch"
description: "### Advisory title: Field-level security issue with .keyword fields\n\n###
  Affected versions:\nOpenSearch 1.0.0-1.3.7 and 2.0.0-2.4.1\n\n### Patched versions:\nOpenSearch
  1.3.8 and 2.5.0\n\n### Impact:\nThere is an issue in the implementation of field-level
  security (FLS) and field masking where rules written to explicitly exclude fields
  are not correctly applied for certain queries that rely on their auto-generated
  .keyword fields.\n\nThis issue is only present for authenticated users with read
  access to the indexes containing the restricted fields.\n\n### Workaround:\nFLS
  rules that use explicit exclusions can be written to grant explicit access instead.
  Policies authored in this way are not subject to this issue.\n\n### Patches:\nOpenSearch
  versions 1.3.8 and 2.5.0 contain a fix for this issue.\n\n### For more information:\nIf
  you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please contact AWS/Amazon
  Security via our issue reporting page (https://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting/)
  or directly via email to [aws-security@amazon.com](mailto:aws-security@amazon.com).
  Please do not create a public GitHub issue."
