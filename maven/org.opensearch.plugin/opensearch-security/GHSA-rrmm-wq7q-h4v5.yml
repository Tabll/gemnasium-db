title: "OpenSearch unauthorized data access on fields protected by field masking for
  fields of type ip, geo_point, geo_shape, xy_point, xy_shape"
description: "OpenSearch versions 2.19.2 and earlier improperly apply field masking
  rules on fields of the types `ip`, `geo_point`, `geo_shape`, `xy_point`, `xy_shape`.
  While the content of these fields is properly redacted in the `_source` document
  returned by search operations, the original unredacted values remain available to
  search queries. This allows to reconstruct the original field contents using range
  queries.\n\nAdditionally, the content of fields of type `geo_point`, `geo_shape`,
  `xy_point`, `xy_shape` is returned in an unredacted form if requested via the `fields`
  option of the search API."
