title: "OpenSearch unauthorized data access on fields protected by field level security
  if field is a member of an object"
description: "OpenSearch versions 2.19.2 and earlier improperly apply Field Level
  Security (FLS) rules on fields which are not at the top level of the source document
  tree (i.e., which are members of a JSON object).\n\nIf an FLS exclusion rule (like
  `~object`) is applied to an object valued attribute in a source document, the object
  is properly removed from the `_source` document in search and get results. However,
  any member attribute of that object remains available to search queries. This allows
  to reconstruct the original field contents using range queries."
