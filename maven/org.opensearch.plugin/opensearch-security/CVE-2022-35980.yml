title: "Improper Authorization of Index Containing Sensitive Information"
description: "OpenSearch Security is a plugin for OpenSearch that offers encryption,
  authentication and authorization. Versions 2.0.0.0 and 2.1.0.0 of the security plugin
  are affected by an information disclosure vulnerability. Requests to an OpenSearch
  cluster configured with advanced access control features document level security
  (DLS), field level security (FLS), and/or field masking will not be filtered when
  the query's search pattern matches an aliased index. OpenSearch Dashboards creates
  an alias to `.kibana` by default, so filters with the index pattern of `*` to restrict
  access to documents or fields will not be applied. This issue allows requests to
  access sensitive information when customer have acted to restrict access that specific
  information. OpenSearch 2.2.0, which is compatible with OpenSearch Security 2.2.0.0,
  contains the fix for this issue. There is no recommended work around."
