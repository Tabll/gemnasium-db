title: "Improper Preservation of Permissions"
description: "OpenSearch is a community-driven, open source fork of Elasticsearch
  and Kibana following the license change in early 2021. There is an issue with the
  implementation of tenant permissions in OpenSearch Dashboards where authenticated
  users with read-only access to a tenant can perform create, edit and delete operations
  on index metadata of dashboards and visualizations in that tenant, potentially rendering
  them unavailable. This issue does not affect index data, only metadata. Dashboards
  correctly enforces read-only permissions when indexing and updating documents. This
  issue does not provide additional read access to data users donâ€™t already have.
  This issue can be mitigated by disabling the tenants functionality for the cluster.
  Versions 1.3.14 and 2.11.0 contain a fix for this issue."
