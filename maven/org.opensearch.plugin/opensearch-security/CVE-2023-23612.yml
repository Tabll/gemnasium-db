title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "OpenSearch is an open source distributed and RESTful search engine.
  OpenSearch uses JWTs to store role claims obtained from the Identity Provider (IdP)
  when the authentication backend is SAML or OpenID Connect. There is an issue in
  how those claims are processed from the JWTs where the leading and trailing whitespace
  is trimmed, allowing users to potentially claim roles they are not assigned to if
  any role matches the whitespace-stripped version of the roles they are a member
  of. This issue is only present for authenticated users, and it requires either the
  existence of roles that match, not considering leading/trailing whitespace, or the
  ability for users to create said matching roles. In addition, the Identity Provider
  must allow leading and trailing spaces in role names. OpenSearch 1.0.0-1.3.7 and
  2.0.0-2.4.1 are affected. Users are advised to upgrade to OpenSearch 1.3.8 or 2.5.0.
  There are no known workarounds for this issue."
