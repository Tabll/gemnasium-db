title: "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')"
description: "Netty is an asynchronous event-driven network application framework
  for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients.
  Netty prior to version 4.1.71.Final skips control chars when they are present at
  the beginning / end of the header name. It should instead fail fast as these are
  not allowed by the spec and could lead to HTTP request smuggling. Failing to do
  the validation might cause netty to \"sanitize\" header names before it forward
  these to another remote system when used as proxy. This remote system can't see
  the invalid usage anymore, and therefore does not do the validation itself. Users
  should upgrade to version 4.1.71.Final."
