title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "The AWS SDK for Java enables Java developers to work with Amazon Web
  Services. A partial-path traversal issue exists within the `downloadDirectory` method
  in the AWS S3 TransferManager component of the AWS SDK for Java v1 prior to version
  1.12.261. Applications using the SDK control the `destinationDirectory` argument,
  but S3 object keys are determined by the application that uploaded the objects.
  The `downloadDirectory` method allows the caller to pass a filesystem object in
  the object key but contained an issue in the validation logic for the key name.
  A knowledgeable actor could bypass the validation logic by including a UNIX double-dot
  in the bucket key. Under certain conditions, this could permit them to retrieve
  a directory from their S3 bucket that is one level up in the filesystem from their
  working directory. This issueâ€™s scope is limited to directories whose name prefix
  matches the destinationDirectory. E.g. for destination directory`/tmp/foo`, the
  actor can cause a download to `/tmp/foo-bar`, but not `/tmp/bar`. If `com.amazonaws.services.s3.transfer.TransferManager::downloadDirectory`
  is used to download an untrusted buckets contents, the contents of that bucket can
  be written outside of the intended destination directory. Version 1.12.261 contains
  a patch for this issue. As a workaround, when calling `com.amazonaws.services.s3.transfer.TransferManager::downloadDirectory`,
  pass a `KeyFilter` that forbids `S3ObjectSummary` objects that `getKey` method return
  a string containing the substring `..` ."
