package_slug: "maven/com.amazonaws/aws-encryption-sdk-java"
title: "Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm"
description: "A weak robustness vulnerability exists in the AWS Encryption SDKs for
  Java, Python, C and Javalcript prior to versions 2.0.0. Due to the non-committing
  property of AES-GCM (and other AEAD ciphers such as AES-GCM-SIV or (X)ChaCha20Poly1305)
  used by the SDKs to encrypt messages, an attacker can craft a unique cyphertext
  which will decrypt to multiple different results, and becomes especially relevant
  in a multi-recipient setting. We recommend users update their SDK to 2.0.0 or later."
