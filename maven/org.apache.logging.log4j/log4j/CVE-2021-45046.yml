title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream
  Component ('Injection')"
description: "It was found that the fix to address CVE-2021-44228 in Apache Log4j
  was incomplete in certain non-default configurations. This could allows attackers
  with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data when the logging configuration
  uses a non-default Pattern Layout with either a Context Lookup (for example, `$${ctx:loginId})`
  or a Thread Context Map pattern (`%X`, `%mdc`, or `%MDC`) to craft malicious input
  data using a JNDI Lookup pattern resulting in a denial of service (DOS) attack.
  Log4j restricts JNDI LDAP lookups to localhost by default. Note that previous mitigations
  involving configuration such as to set the system property `log4j2.noFormatMsgLookup`
  to `true` do NOT mitigate this specific vulnerability. Log4j fixes this issue by
  removing support for message lookup patterns and disabling JNDI functionality by
  default."
