title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "JMSAppender in Log4j is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted data
  when the attacker has write access to the Log4j configuration. The attacker can
  provide `TopicBindingName` and `TopicConnectionFactoryBindingName` configurations
  causing JMSAppender to perform JNDI requests that result in remote code execution
  in a similar fashion to CVE-2021-44228. Note this issue only affects Log4j when
  specifically configured to use JMSAppender, which is not the default. Apache Log4j
  reached end of life in August Users should upgrade to Log4j 2 as it addresses numerous
  other issues from the previous versions."
