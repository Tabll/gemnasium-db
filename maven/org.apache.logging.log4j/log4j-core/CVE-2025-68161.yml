package_slug: "maven/org.apache.logging.log4j/log4j-core"
title: "Apache Log4j does not verify the TLS hostname in its Socket Appender"
description: "The Socket Appender in Apache Log4j Core versions 2.0-beta9 through
  2.25.2 does not perform TLS hostname verification of the peer certificate, even
  when the  [verifyHostName](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/appenders/network.html#SslConfiguration-attr-verifyHostName)
  \ configuration attribute or the  [log4j2.sslVerifyHostName](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/systemproperties.html#log4j2.sslVerifyHostName)
  system property is set to true.\n\nThis issue may allow a man-in-the-middle attacker
  to intercept or redirect log traffic under the following conditions:\n\n*  The attacker
  is able to intercept or redirect network traffic between the client and the log
  receiver.\n*  The attacker can present a server certificate issued by a certification
  authority trusted by the Socket Appender’s configured trust store (or by the default
  Java trust store if no custom trust store is configured).\n\n\nUsers are advised
  to upgrade to Apache Log4j Core version 2.25.3, which addresses this issue.\n\nAs
  an alternative mitigation, the Socket Appender may be configured to use a private
  or restricted trust root to limit the set of trusted certificates."
