package_slug: "maven/org.apache.logging.log4j/log4j-api"
title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "It was found that the fix to address CVE-2021-44228 in Apache Log4j
  2.15.0 was incomplete in certain non-default configurations. This could allows attackers
  with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data when the logging configuration
  uses a non-default Pattern Layout with either a Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId})
  or a Thread Context Map pattern (%X, %mdc, or %MDC) to craft malicious input data
  using a JNDI Lookup pattern resulting in an information leak and remote code execution
  in some environments and local code execution in all environments. Log4j 2.16.0
  (Java 8) and 2.12.2 (Java 7) fix this issue by removing support for message lookup
  patterns and disabling JNDI functionality by default."
