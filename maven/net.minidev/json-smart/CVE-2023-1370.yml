package_slug: "maven/net.minidev/json-smart"
title: "json-smart Uncontrolled Recursion vulnerability"
description: "Affected versions of [net.minidev:json-smart](https://github.com/netplex/json-smart-v1)
  are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) due to a StackOverflowError when parsing
  a deeply nested JSON array or object.\n\nWhen reaching a ‘[‘ or ‘{‘ character in
  the JSON input, the code parses an array or an object respectively. It was discovered
  that the 3PP does not have any limit to the nesting of such arrays or objects. Since
  the parsing of nested arrays and objects is done recursively, nesting too many of
  them can cause stack exhaustion (stack overflow) and crash the software."
