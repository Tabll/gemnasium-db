package_slug: "maven/org.wildfly/wildfly-server"
title: "Wildfly Server Role Based Access Control (RBAC) provider has Improper Access
  Control"
description: "A flaw was found in the Wildfly Server Role Based Access Control (RBAC)
  provider. When authorization to control management operations is secured using the
  Role Based Access Control provider, a user without the required privileges can suspend
  or resume the server. A user with a Monitor or Auditor role is supposed to have
  only read access permissions and should not be able to suspend the server.\nThe
  vulnerability is caused by the Suspend and Resume handlers not performing authorization
  checks to validate whether the current user has the required permissions to proceed
  with the action."
