title: "Duplicate Advisory: WildFly Elytron OpenID Connect Client Extension authorization
  code injection attack"
description: "# Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of [GHSA-5565-3c98-g6jc](https://advisory-inbox.githubapp.com/advisory_reviews/GHSA-5565-3c98-g6jc).
  This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n# Original Description\nA
  vulnerability was found in OIDC-Client. When using the RH SSO OIDC adapter with
  EAP 7.x or when using the elytron-oidc-client subsystem with EAP 8.x, authorization
  code injection attacks can occur, allowing an attacker to inject a stolen authorization
  code into the attacker's own session with the client with a victim's identity. This
  is usually done with a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) or phishing attack."
