title: "Apache Camel Missing Header Out Filter Leads to Potential Bypass/Injection
  Vulnerability"
description: "Bypass/Injection vulnerability in Apache Camel in Camel-Undertow component
  under particular conditions.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Camel: from 4.10.0 before
  4.10.3, from 4.8.0 before 4.8.6.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version
  4.10.3 for 4.10.x LTS and 4.8.6 for 4.8.x LTS.\n\nCamel undertow component is vulnerable
  to Camel message header injection, in particular the custom header filter strategy
  used by the component only filter the \"out\" direction, while it doesn't filter
  the \"in\" direction.\n\n\nThis allows an attacker to include Camel specific headers
  that for some Camel components can alter the behaviour such as the camel-bean component,
  or the camel-exec component."
