title: "Apache Camel: Camel Message Header Injection via Improper Filtering"
description: "Bypass/Injection vulnerability in Apache Camel-Bean component under
  particular conditions.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Camel: from 4.9.0 through <=
  4.10.1, from 4.0.0-M1 through <= 4.8.4, from 3.10.0 through <= 3.22.3.\n\nUsers
  are recommended to upgrade to version 4.10.2 for 4.10.x LTS, 4.8.5 for 4.8.x LTS
  and 3.22.4 for 3.x releases.\n\nThis vulnerability is only present in the following
  situation. The user is using one of the following HTTP Servers via one the of the
  following Camel components\n\n*  camel-servlet\n*  camel-jetty\n*  camel-undertow\n*
  \ camel-platform-http\n*  camel-netty-http\n\n\nand in the route, the exchange will
  be routed to a camel-bean producer. So ONLY camel-bean component is affected. In
  particular:\n\n*  The bean invocation (is only affected if you use any of the above together
  with camel-bean component).\n\n*  The bean that can be called, has more than 1 method
  implemented.\nIn these conditions an attacker could be able to forge a Camel header
  name and make the bean component invoking other methods in the same bean.\n\nThe
  vulnerability arises due to a bug in the default filtering mechanism that only blocks
  headers starting with \"Camel\", \"camel\", or \"org.apache.camel.\".\n\n\nMitigation: You
  can easily work around this in your Camel applications by removing the headers in
  your Camel routes. There are many ways of doing this, also globally or per route.
  This means you could use the removeHeaders EIP, to filter out anything like \"cAmel,
  cAMEL\" etc, or in general everything not starting with \"Camel\", \"camel\" or
  \"org.apache.camel.\"."
