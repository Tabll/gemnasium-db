title: "Apache Camel Message Header Injection through request parameters"
description: "Bypass/Injection vulnerability in Apache Camel.\n\nThis issue affects
  Apache Camel: from 4.9.0 before 4.10.2, from 4.0.0 before 4.8.5, from 3.10.0 before
  3.22.4.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 4.10.2 for 4.10.x LTS, 4.8.5
  for 4.8.x LTS and 3.22.4 for 3.x releases.\n\nThis vulnerability is present in Camel's
  default incoming header filter, that allows an attacker to include Camel specific
  headers that for some Camel components can alter the behaviours such as the camel-bean
  component, or the camel-exec component.\n\nIf you have Camel applications that are
  directly connected to the internet via HTTP, then an attackerÂ could include parameters
  in the HTTP requests that are sent to the Camel application that get translated
  into headers.\n\nThe headers could be both provided as request parameters for an
  HTTP methods invocation or as part of the payload of the HTTP methods invocation.\n\nAll
  the known Camel HTTP component such as camel-servlet, camel-jetty, camel-undertow,
  camel-platform-http, and camel-netty-http would be vulnerable out of the box.\n\nThis
  CVE is related to the CVE-2025-27636: while they have the same root cause and are
  fixed with the same fix, CVE-2025-27636 was assumed to only be exploitable if an
  attacker could add malicious HTTP headers, while we have now determined that it
  is also exploitable via HTTP parameters. Like in CVE-2025-27636, exploitation is
  only possible if the Camel route uses particular vulnerable components."
