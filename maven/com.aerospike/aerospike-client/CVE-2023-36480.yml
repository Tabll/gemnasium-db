package_slug: "maven/com.aerospike/aerospike-client"
title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "The Aerospike Java client is a Java application that implements a network
  protocol to communicate with an Aerospike server. Prior to versions 7.0.0, 6.2.0,
  5.2.0, and 4.5.0 some of the messages received from the server contain Java objects
  that the client deserializes when it encounters them without further validation.
  Attackers that manage to trick clients into communicating with a malicious server
  can include especially crafted objects in its responses that, once deserialized
  by the client, force it to execute arbitrary code. This can be abused to take control
  of the machine the client is running on. Versions 7.0.0, 6.2.0, 5.2.0, and 4.5.0
  contain a patch for this issue."
