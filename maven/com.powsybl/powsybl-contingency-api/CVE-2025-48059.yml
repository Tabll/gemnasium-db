title: "PowSyBl Core Contains a Polynomial ReDoS in RegexCriterion"
description: "_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nThis is an advisory
  for a **potential polynomial Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)** vulnerability
  in the `RegexCriterion` class. This class compiles and evaluates an unvalidated,
  user-supplied regular expression against the identifier of an `Identifiable` object
  via `Pattern.compile(regex).matcher(id).find()`.\n\nTo trigger **polynomial ReDoS**
  in `RegexCriterion`, **two attacker-controlled conditions** must be met:\n- **Control
  over the regex input** passed into the constructor:\n- _Example:_ An attacker supplies
  a malicious pattern such as `(.*a){10000}`.\n- **Control or influence over the output
  of `Identifiable.getId()`**:\n-  _Example:_ A long string like `\"aaaa...!\"` that
  forces excessive backtracking.\n\nIf both conditions are satisfied, a malicious
  actor can cause **significant CPU exhaustion** through repeated or recursive `filter(...)`
  calls â€” especially if performed over large network models or filtering operations.\nWhile
  this class does not handle file or memory data directly, its reliance on untrusted
  regular expressions and potentially attacker-controlled identifiers makes it vulnerable
  to **polynomial ReDoS** under the right conditions. This risk is amplified when
  the library is used in dynamic or scriptable environments where external users control
  either criterion construction or network object identifiers.\nAlthough not as dangerous
  as _catastrophic exponential ReDoS_, the polynomial pattern still induces significant
  performance\ndegradation as input size increases."
