title: "PowSyBl Core allows deserialization of untrusted SparseMatrix data"
description: "_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nThis is a disclosure
  for a security vulnerability in the `SparseMatrix` class. The vulnerability is a
  deserialization issue that\ncan lead to a wide range of privilege escalations depending
  on the circumstances. The problematic area is the `read` method\nof the `SparseMatrix`
  class.\nThis method takes in an `InputStream` and returns a `SparseMatrix` object.
  We consider this to be a method that can be\nexposed to untrusted input in at least
  two use cases:\n- A user can adopt this method in an application where users can
  submit an `InputStream` and the application parses it into\na `SparseMatrix`. This
  can be a multi-tenant application that hosts many different users perhaps with different
  privilege\nlevels.\n- A user adopts the method for a local tool but receives the
  `InputStream` from external sources."
