title: "PowSyBl Core contains Polynomial REDoS’es"
description: "_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nThis is an advisory
  for a **potential polynomial Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)** vulnerability
  in the PowSyBl's DataSource mechanism. When the `listNames(String regex)` method
  is called on a DataSource, the user-supplied regular expression (which may be unvalidated)
  is compiled and evaluated against a collection of file-like resource names.\n\nTo
  trigger a **polynomial ReDoS** via this mechanism, **two attacker-controlled conditions**
  must be met:\n- **Control over the regex input** passed into `listNames(String regex)`.\n-
  _Example:_ An attacker supplies a malicious pattern like `(.*a){10000}`.\n- **Control
  or influence over the file/resource names** being matched.\n- _Example:_ Filenames
  such as `\"aaaa...!\"` that induce regex engine backtracking.\n\nIf both conditions
  are satisfied, a malicious actor can cause **significant CPU consumption** due to
  regex backtracking — even\nwith polynomial patterns. Since both inputs can be controlled
  via a publicly accessible method or external filesystem handling,\nthe `listNames(String
  regex)` method is considered vulnerable to polynomial **REDoS**.\n\nUnlike classic
  _catastrophic exponential_ ReDoS, this subtle attack exploits a greedy `.*` prefix
  followed by a fixed suffix, repeated multiple times.\nWhen applied to long filenames
  that almost match the pattern, the regex engine performs extensive backtracking,
  degrading performance predictably with input size. In a multi-tenant environment,
  an attacker can degrade the performance - and thereby the availability - of the
  server to an extent that it affects other users of the application. This can for
  example be useful if an attacker wants to delay other users in a scenario where
  a time advantage can be a competitive advantage.\nA tricky part in this is that
  the attacker needs to control both the pattern and the input which may not always
  be the case."
