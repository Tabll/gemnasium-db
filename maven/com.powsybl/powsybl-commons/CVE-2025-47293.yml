title: "PowSyBl Core XML Reader allows XXE and SSRF"
description: "_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\nIn certain places,
  powsybl-core XML parsing is vulnerable to an XXE attack and in on place also to
  an SSRF attack.\nThis allows an attacker to elevate their privileges to read files
  that they do not have permissions to, including sensitive files on the system.\nThe
  vulnerable class is `com.powsybl.commons.xml.XmlReader` which is considered to be
  untrusted in use cases where untrusted users can submit their XML to the vulnerable
  methods. This can be a multi-tenant application that hosts many different users
  perhaps with different privilege levels."
