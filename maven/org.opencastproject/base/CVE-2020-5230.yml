title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream
  Component ('Injection')"
description: "Opencast before 8.1 and 7.6 allows almost arbitrary identifiers for
  media packages and elements to be used. This can be problematic for operation and
  security since such identifiers are sometimes used for file system operations which
  may lead to an attacker being able to escape working directories and write files
  to other locations. In addition, Opencast's Id.toString(…) vs Id.compact(…) behavior,
  the latter trying to mitigate some of the file system problems, can cause errors
  due to identifier mismatch since an identifier may unintentionally change. This
  issue is fixed in Opencast 7.6 and 8.1."
