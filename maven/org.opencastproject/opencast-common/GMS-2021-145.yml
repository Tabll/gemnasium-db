package_slug: "maven/org.opencastproject/opencast-common"
title: "Opencast publishes global system account credentials"
description: "The issue was mostly mitigated before, drastically reducing the risk.
  See references below for more information.\n\n### Impact\n\nOpencast before version
  10.6 will try to authenticate against any external services listed in a media package
  when it is trying to access the files, sending the global system user's credentials,
  regardless of the target being part of the Opencast cluster or not.\n\nPrevious
  mitigations already prevented clear text authentications for such requests (e.g.
  HTTP Basic authentication), but with enough malicious intent, even hashed credentials
  can be broken.\n\n### Patches\n\nOpencast 10.6 will now send authentication requests
  only against servers which are part of the Opencast cluster, preventing external
  services from getting any form of authentication attempt in the first place.\n\n###
  Workarounds\n\nNo workaround available.\n\n### References\n\n- [Patch fixing the
