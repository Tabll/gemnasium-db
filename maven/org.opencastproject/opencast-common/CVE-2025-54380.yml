package_slug: "maven/org.opencastproject/opencast-common"
title: "Opencast still publishes global system account credentials "
description: "Opencast prior to versions 17.6 would incorrectly send the hashed global
  system account credentials (ie: `org.opencastproject.security.digest.user` and `org.opencastproject.security.digest.pass`)
  when attempting to fetch mediapackage elements included in a mediapackage XML file.
  \ A [previous CVE](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/security/advisories/GHSA-hcxx-mp6g-6gr9)
  prevented many cases where the credentials were inappropriately sent, but not all.
  \ The remainder are addressed with this patch."
