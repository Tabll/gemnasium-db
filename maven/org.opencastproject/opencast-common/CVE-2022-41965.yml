title: "URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')"
description: "Opencast is a free, open-source platform to support the management of
  educational audio and video content. Prior to Opencast 12.5, Opencast's Paella authentication
  page could be used to redirect to an arbitrary URL for authenticated users. The
  vulnerability allows attackers to redirect users to sites outside of one's Opencast
  install, potentially facilitating phishing attacks or other security issues. This
  issue is fixed in Opencast 12.5 and newer."
