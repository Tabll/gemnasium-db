package_slug: "maven/org.opencastproject/opencast-search-service-impl"
title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "Opencast is a free and open source solution for automated video capture
  and distribution at scale. Prior to Opencast 10.14 and 11.7, users could pass along
  URLs for files belonging to organizations other than the user's own, which Opencast
  would then import into the current organization, bypassing organizational barriers.
  Attackers must have full access to Opencast's ingest REST interface, and also know
  internal links to resources in another organization of the same Opencast cluster.
  Users who do not run a multi-tenant cluster are not affected by this issue. This
  issue is fixed in Opencast 10.14 and 11.7."
