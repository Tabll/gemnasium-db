title: "Searching Opencast may cause a denial of service"
description: "First noticed in Opencast 13 and 14, Opencast's Elasticsearch integration
  may generate syntactically invalid Elasticsearch queries in relation to previously
  acceptable search queries.  From Opencast version 11.4 and newer, Elasticsearch
  queries are retried a configurable number of times in the case of error to handle
  temporary losses of connection to Elasticsearch.  These invalid queries would fail,
  causing the retry mechanism to begin requerying with the same syntactically invalid
  query immediately, in an infinite loop.  This causes a massive increase in log size
  which can in some cases cause a denial of service due to disk exhaustion."
