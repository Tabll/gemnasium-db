title: "Opencast has a partial path traversal vulnerability in UI config"
description: "The protections against path traversal attacks in the UI config module
  are insufficient, still partially allowing for attacks in very specific cases.\n\nThe
  path is checked without checking for the file separator. This could allow attackers
  access to files within another folder which starts with the same path. For example,
  the default UI config directory is placed at `/etc/opencast/ui-config`. Without
  this patch, an attacker can get access to files in a folder `/etc/opencast/ui-config-hidden`
  if those files are readable by Opencast.\n\nGeneral path traversal is not possible.
  For example, an attacker **cannot** exploit this to access files in `/etc/opencast/encoding`
  or even in `/etc/opencast/` directly."
