identifier: "CVE-2020-5206"
package_slug: "maven/org.opencastproject/opencast-kernel"
title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "In Opencast using a `remember-me` cookie with an arbitrary username
  can cause Opencast to assume proper authentication for that user even if the remember-me
  cookie was incorrect given that the attacked endpoint also allows anonymous access.
  This way, an attacker can, for example, fake a `remember-me` token, assume the identity
  of the global system administrator and request non-public content from the search
  service without ever providing any proper authentication."
