identifier: "CVE-2020-5229"
package_slug: "maven/org.opencastproject/opencast-kernel"
title: "Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm"
description: "Opencast stores passwords using the outdated and cryptographically insecure
  MD5 hash algorithm. Password hashes are salted using the username instead of a random
  salt, causing hashes for users with the same username and password to collide. This
  is problematic especially for common users like the default `admin` user. This means
  that for an attacker it might be feasible to reconstruct a user's password given
  access to these hashes. Note that attackers needing access to the hashes means that
  they must gain access to the database in which these are stored first to be able
  to start cracking the passwords. The problem is addressed in Opencast 8.1 which
  now uses the modern and much stronger bcrypt password hashing algorithm for storing
  passwords. Note that old hashes remain MD5 until the password is updated. For a
  list of users whose password hashes are stored using MD5, take a look at the
  `/user-utils/users/md5.json` REST endpoint."
