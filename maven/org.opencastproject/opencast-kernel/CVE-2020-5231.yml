package_slug: "maven/org.opencastproject/opencast-kernel"
title: "Incorrect Default Permissions"
description: "In Opencast before 7.6 and 8.1, users with the role ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN
  can use the user-utils endpoint to create new users not including the role ROLE_ADMIN.
  ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN is a non-standard role in Opencast which is referenced neither
  in the documentation nor in any code (except for tests) but only in the security
  configuration. From the name – implying an admin for a specific course – users would
  never expect that this role allows user creation. This issue is fixed in 7.6 and
  8.1 which both ship a new default security configuration."
