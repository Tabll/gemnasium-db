title: "Apache Axis 1.x (EOL) may allow RCE when untrusted input is passed to getService"
description: "When integrating Apache Axis 1.x in an application, it may not have
  been obvious that looking up a service through \"ServiceFactory.getService\" allows
  potentially dangerous lookup mechanisms such as LDAP. When passing untrusted input
  to this API method, this could expose the application to DoS, SSRF and even attacks
  leading to RCE.\n\nAs Axis 1 has been EOL we recommend you migrate to a different
  SOAP engine, such as Apache Axis 2/Java. As a workaround, you may review your code
  to verify no untrusted or unsanitized input is passed to \"ServiceFactory.getService\",
  or by applying the patch from  https://github.com/apache/axis-axis1-java/commit/7e66753427466590d6def0125e448d2791723210
  . The Apache Axis project does not expect to create an Axis 1.x release fixing this
  problem, though contributors that would like to work towards this are welcome."
