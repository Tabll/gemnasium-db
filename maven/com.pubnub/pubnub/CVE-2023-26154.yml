  com.pubnub:pubnub; versions of the package pubnub before 6.19.0; all versions of
  the package github.com/pubnub/go; versions of the package github.com/pubnub/go/v7

  the package pubnub/swift before 6.2.0; versions of the package pubnub before 5.2.0;
  versions of the package pubnub before 4.3.0 is vulnerable to Insufficient Entropy
  via the getKey function, due to inefficient implementation of the AES-256-CBC cryptographic
  algorithm. The provided encrypt function is less secure when hex encoding and trimming
  are applied, leaving half of the bits in the key always the same for every encoded
  message or file.\r\r**Note:**\r\rIn order to exploit this vulnerability, the attacker
  needs to invest resources in preparing the attack and brute-force the encryption."
