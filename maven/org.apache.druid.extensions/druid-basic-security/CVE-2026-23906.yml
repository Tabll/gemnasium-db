title: "Apache Druid Vulnerable to Authentication Bypass"
description: "Affected Products and Versions\n*  Apache Druid\n*  Affected Versions:
  0.17.0 through 35.x (all versions prior to 36.0.0)\n*  Prerequisites:  *  druid-basic-security
  extension enabled\n*  LDAP authenticator configured\n*  Underlying LDAP server permits
  anonymous bind\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVulnerability Description\n\nAn authentication bypass
  vulnerability exists in Apache Druid when using the druid-basic-security extension
  with LDAP authentication. If the underlying LDAP server is configured to allow anonymous\nbinds,
  an attacker can bypass authentication by providing an existing username with an
  empty password. This allows unauthorized access to otherwise restricted Druid resources
  without valid credentials.\n\nThe vulnerability stems from improper validation of
  LDAP authentication responses when anonymous binds are permitted, effectively treating
  anonymous bind success as valid user authentication.\n\nImpact\n\nA remote, unauthenticated
  attacker can:\n*  Gain unauthorized access to the Apache Druid cluster\n*  Access
  sensitive data stored in Druid datasources\n*  Execute queries and potentially manipulate
  data\n*  Access administrative interfaces if the bypassed account has elevated privileges\n*
  \ Completely compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the
  Druid deployment\n\n\nMitigation\n\nImmediate Mitigation (No Druid Upgrade Required):\n*
  \ Disable anonymous bind on your LDAP server. This prevents the vulnerability from
  being exploitable and is the recommended immediate action.\n\n\n\nResolution\n*
  \ Upgrade Apache Druid to version 36.0.0 or later, which includes fixes to properly
  reject anonymous LDAP bind attempts."
