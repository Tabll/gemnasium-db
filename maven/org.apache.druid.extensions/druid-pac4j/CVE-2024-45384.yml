title: "druid-pac4j, Apache Druid extension, has Padding Oracle vulnerability"
description: "Padding Oracle vulnerability in Apache Druid extension, druid-pac4j.\nThis
  could allow an attacker to manipulate a pac4j session cookie.\n\nThis issue affects
  Apache Druid versions 0.18.0 through 30.0.0.\nSince the druid-pac4j extension is
  optional and disabled by default, Druid installations not using the druid-pac4j
  extension are not affected by this vulnerability.\n\nWhile we are not aware of a
  way to meaningfully exploit this flaw, we nevertheless recommend upgrading to version
  30.0.1 or higher which fixes the issue and ensuring you have a strong druid.auth.pac4j.cookiePassphrase
  as a precaution."
