package_slug: "maven/org.rundeck/rundeckapp"
title: "Authenticated users can view job names and groups they do not have authorization
  to view"
description: "Rundeck is an open source automation service with a web console, command
  line tools and a WebAPI. In affected versions access to two URLs used in both Rundeck
  Open Source and Process Automation products could allow authenticated users to access
  the URL path, which provides a list of job names and groups for any project, without
  the necessary authorization checks. The output of these endpoints only exposes the
  name of job groups and the jobs contained within the specified project. The output
  is read-only and the access does not allow changes to the information. This vulnerability
  has been patched in version 4.17.3. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to
  upgrade may block access to the two URLs used in either Rundeck Open Source or Process
  Automation products at a load balancer level."
