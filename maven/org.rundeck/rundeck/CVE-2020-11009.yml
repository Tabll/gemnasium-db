package_slug: "maven/org.rundeck/rundeck"
title: "Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key"
description: "In Rundeck before version 3.2.6, authenticated users can craft a request
  that reveals Execution data and logs and Job details that they are not authorized
  to see. Depending on the configuration and the way that Rundeck is used, this could
  result in anything between a high severity risk, or a very low risk. If access is
  tightly restricted and all users on the system have access to all projects, this
  is not really much of an issue. If access is wider and allows login for users that
  do not have access to any projects, or project access is restricted, there is a
  larger issue. If access is meant to be restricted and secrets, sensitive data, or
  intellectual property are exposed in Rundeck execution output and job data, the
  risk becomes much higher. This vulnerability is patched in version 3.2.6"
