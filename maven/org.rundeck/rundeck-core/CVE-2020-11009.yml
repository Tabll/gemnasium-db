identifier: "CVE-2020-11009"
package_slug: "maven/org.rundeck/rundeck-core"
title: "Information Exposure"
description: "In Rundeck, authenticated users can craft a request that reveals Execution
  data and logs and Job details that they are not authorized to see. Depending on
  the configuration and the way that Rundeck is used, this could result in anything
  between a high severity risk, or a very low risk. If access is tightly restricted
  and all users on the system have access to all projects, this is not really much
  of an issue. If access is wider and allows login for users that do not have access
  to any projects, or project access is restricted, there is a larger issue. If access
  is meant to be restricted and secrets, sensitive data, or intellectual property
  are exposed in Rundeck execution output and job data, the risk becomes much higher.
