  user can upload a zip-format plugin with a crafted plugin.yaml, or a crafted aclpolicy
  yaml file, or upload an untrusted project archive with a crafted aclpolicy yaml
  file, that can cause the server to run untrusted code on Rundeck Community or Enterprise
  Edition. An authenticated user can make a POST request, that can cause the server
  to run untrusted code on Rundeck Enterprise Edition. The zip-format plugin issues
  requires authentication and authorization to these access levels, and affects all
  Rundeck editions:`admin` level access to the `system` resource type. The ACL Policy
  yaml file upload issues requires authentication and authorization to these access
  levels, and affects all Rundeck editions: `create` `update` or `admin` level access
  to a `project_acl` resource, and/or`create` `update` or `admin` level access to
  the `system_acl` resource. The unauthorized POST request requires authentication,
