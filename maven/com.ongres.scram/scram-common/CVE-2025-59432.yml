title: "Timing Attack Vulnerability in SCRAM Authentication"
description: "A timing attack vulnerability exists in the SCRAM Java implementation.
  The issue arises because `Arrays.equals` was used to compare secret values such
  as client proofs and server signatures. Since `Arrays.equals` performs a short-circuit
  comparison, the execution time varies depending on how many leading bytes match.
  This behavior could allow an attacker to perform a timing side-channel attack and
  potentially infer sensitive authentication material. All users relying on SCRAM
  authentication are impacted."
