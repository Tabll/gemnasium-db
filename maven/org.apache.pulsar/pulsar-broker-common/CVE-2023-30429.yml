title: "Incorrect Authorization"
description: "Incorrect Authorization vulnerability in Apache Software Foundation
  Apache Pulsar.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Pulsar: before 2.10.4, and 2.11.0.\n\nWhen
  a client connects to the Pulsar Function Worker via the Pulsar Proxy where the Pulsar
  Proxy uses mTLS authentication to authenticate with the Pulsar Function Worker,
  the Pulsar Function Worker incorrectly performs authorization by using the Proxy's
  role for authorization instead of the client's role, which can lead to privilege
  escalation, especially if the proxy is configured with a superuser role.\n\nThe
  recommended mitigation for impacted users is to upgrade the Pulsar Function Worker
  to a patched version.\n\n2.10 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at
  least 2.10.4.\n2.11 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 2.11.1.\n3.0
  Pulsar Function Worker users are unaffected.\nAny users running the Pulsar Function
  Worker for 2.9.* and earlier should upgrade to one of the above patched versions.\n"
