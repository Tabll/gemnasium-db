package_slug: "maven/org.apache.pulsar/pulsar-broker-common"
title: "Improper Certificate Validation"
description: "Apache Pulsar Brokers and Proxies create an internal Pulsar Admin Client
  that does not verify peer TLS certificates, even when tlsAllowInsecureConnection
  is disabled via configuration. The Pulsar Admin Client's intra-cluster and geo-replication
  HTTPS connections is vulnerable to man in the middle attacks, which could leak authentication
  data, configuration data, and any other data sent by these clients. An attacker
  can only take advantage of this vulnerability by taking control of a machine 'between'
  the client and the server. The attacker must then actively manipulate traffic to
  perform the attack. This issue affects Apache Pulsar Broker and Proxy versions 2.7.0
  to 2.7.4; 2.8.0 to 2.8.3; 2.9.0 to 2.9.2; 2.10.0; 2.6.4 and earlier."
