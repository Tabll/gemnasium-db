package_slug: "maven/org.apache.pulsar/pulsar-broker-common"
title: "Improper Certificate Validation"
description: "TLS hostname verification cannot be enabled in the Pulsar Broker's Java
  Client, the Pulsar Broker's Java Admin Client, the Pulsar WebSocket Proxy's Java
  Client, and the Pulsar Proxy's Admin Client leaving intra-cluster connections and
  geo-replication connections vulnerable to man in the middle attacks, which could
  leak credentials, configuration data, message data, and any other data sent by these
  clients. The vulnerability is for both the pulsar+ssl protocol and HTTPS. An attacker
  can only take advantage of this vulnerability by taking control of a machine 'between'
  the client and the server. The attacker must then actively manipulate traffic to
  perform the attack by providing the client with a cryptographically valid certificate
  for an unrelated host. This issue affects Apache Pulsar Broker, Proxy, and WebSocket
  Proxy versions 2.7.0 to 2.7.4; 2.8.0 to 2.8.3; 2.9.0 to 2.9.2; 2.10.0; 2.6.4 and
  earlier."
