  Apache Pulsar Broker allows a client to stay connected to a broker after authentication
  data expires if the client connected through the Pulsar Proxy when the broker is
  configured with authenticateOriginalAuthData=false or if a client connects directly
  to a broker with a specially crafted connect command when the broker is configured
  with authenticateOriginalAuthData=false.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Pulsar: through
  2.9.4, from 2.10.0 through 2.10.3, 2.11.0.\n\n2.9 Pulsar Broker users should upgrade
  to at least 2.9.5.\n2.10 Pulsar Broker users should upgrade to at least 2.10.4.\n2.11
  Pulsar Broker users should upgrade to at least 2.11.1.\n3.0 Pulsar Broker users
  are unaffected.\nAny users running the Pulsar Broker for 2.8.* and earlier should
