title: "Apache Pulsar Kafka Connector Logs Sensitive Information in Application Logs"
description: "Apache Pulsar contains multiple connectors for integrating with Apache
  Kafka. The Pulsar IO Apache Kafka Source Connector, Sink Connector, and Kafka Connect
  Adaptor Sink Connector log sensitive configuration properties in plain text in application
  logs.\n\n\nThis vulnerability can lead to unintended exposure of credentials in
  log files, potentially allowing attackers with access to these logs to obtain Apache
  Kafka credentials. The vulnerability's impact is limited by the fact that an attacker
  would need access to the application logs to exploit this issue.\n\nThis issue affects
  Apache Pulsar IO's Apache Kafka connectors in all versions before 3.0.11, 3.3.6,
  and 4.0.4.\n\n\n3.0.x version users should upgrade to at least 3.0.11.\n\n3.3.x
  version users should upgrade to at least 3.3.6.\n\n4.0.x version users should upgrade
  to at least 4.0.4.\n\n\nUsers operating versions prior to those listed above should
  upgrade to the aforementioned patched versions or newer versions."
