title: "Apache Pulsar: Improper Authentication for Pulsar Proxy Statistics Endpoint"
description: "Improper Authentication vulnerability in Apache Pulsar Proxy allows
  an attacker to connect to the /proxy-stats endpoint without authentication. The
  vulnerable endpoint exposes detailed statistics about live connections, along with
  the capability to modify the logging level of proxied connections without requiring
  proper authentication credentials.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Pulsar versions
  from 2.6.0 to 2.10.5, from 2.11.0 to 2.11.2, from 3.0.0 to 3.0.1, and 3.1.0.\n\nThe
  known risks include exposing sensitive information such as connected client IP and
  unauthorized logging level manipulation which could lead to a denial-of-service
  condition by significantly increasing the proxy's logging overhead. When deployed
  via the Apache Pulsar Helm chart within Kubernetes environments, the actual client
  IP might not be revealed through the load balancer's default behavior, which typically
  obscures the original source IP addresses when externalTrafficPolicy is being configured
  to \"Cluster\" by default. The /proxy-stats endpoint contains topic level statistics,
  however, in the default configuration, the topic level statistics aren't known to
  be exposed.\n\n2.10 Pulsar Proxy users should upgrade to at least 2.10.6.\n2.11
  Pulsar Proxy users should upgrade to at least 2.11.3.\n3.0 Pulsar Proxy users should
  upgrade to at least 3.0.2.\n3.1 Pulsar Proxy users should upgrade to at least 3.1.1.\n\nUsers
  operating versions prior to those listed above should upgrade to the aforementioned
  patched versions or newer versions. Additionally, it's imperative to recognize that
  the Apache Pulsar Proxy is not intended for direct exposure to the internet. The
  architectural design of Pulsar Proxy assumes that it will operate within a secured
  network environment, safeguarded by appropriate perimeter defenses."
