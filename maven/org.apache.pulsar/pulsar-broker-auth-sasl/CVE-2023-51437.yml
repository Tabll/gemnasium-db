  Provider can allow an attacker to forge a SASL Role Token that will pass signature
  verification.\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 2.11.3, 3.0.2, or 3.1.1
  which fixes the issue. Users should also consider updating the configured secret
  in the `saslJaasServerRoleTokenSignerSecretPath` file.\n\nAny component matching
  an above version running the SASL Authentication Provider is affected. That includes
  the Pulsar Broker, Proxy, Websocket Proxy, or Function Worker.\n\n2.11 Pulsar users
  should upgrade to at least 2.11.3.\n3.0 Pulsar users should upgrade to at least
  3.0.2.\n3.1 Pulsar users should upgrade to at least 3.1.1.\nAny users running Pulsar
  2.8, 2.9, 2.10, and earlier should upgrade to one of the above patched versions.\n\nFor
