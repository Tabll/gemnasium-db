title: "Apache Pulsar: Improper Authorization For Namespace and Topic Management Endpoints"
description: "This vulnerability allows authenticated users with produce or consume
  permissions to perform unauthorized operations on partitioned topics, such as unloading
  topics and triggering compaction. These management operations should be restricted
  to users with the tenant admin role or superuser role. An authenticated user with
  produce permission can create subscriptions and update subscription properties on
  partitioned topics, even though this should be limited to users with consume permissions.
  This impact analysis assumes that Pulsar has been configured with the default authorization
  provider. For custom authorization providers, the impact could be slightly different.
  Additionally, the vulnerability allows an authenticated user to read, create, modify,
  and delete namespace properties in any namespace in any tenant. In Pulsar, namespace
  properties are reserved for user provided metadata about the namespace.\n\nThis
  issue affects Apache Pulsar versions from 2.7.1 to 2.10.6, from 2.11.0 to 2.11.4,
  from 3.0.0 to 3.0.3, from 3.1.0 to 3.1.3, and from 3.2.0 to 3.2.1.\n\n3.0 Apache
  Pulsar users should upgrade to at least 3.0.4.\n3.1 and 3.2 Apache Pulsar users
  should upgrade to at least 3.2.2.\n\nUsers operating versions prior to those listed
  above should upgrade to the aforementioned patched versions or newer versions."
