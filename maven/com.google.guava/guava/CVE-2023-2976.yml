title: "Guava vulnerable to insecure use of temporary directory"
description: "Use of Java's default temporary directory for file creation in `FileBackedOutputStream`
  in Google Guava versions 1.0 to 31.1 on Unix systems and Android Ice Cream Sandwich
  allows other users and apps on the machine with access to the default Java temporary
  directory to be able to access the files created by the class.\n\nEven though the
  security vulnerability is fixed in version 32.0.0, maintainers recommend using version
  32.0.1 as version 32.0.0 breaks some functionality under Windows."
