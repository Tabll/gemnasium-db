description: "Use of Java's default temporary directory for file creation in `FileBackedOutputStream`
  in Google Guava versions 1.0 to 31.1 on Unix systems and Android Ice Cream Sandwich
  allows other users and apps on the machine with access to the default Java temporary
  directory to be able to access the files created by the class.\n\nEven though the
