package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.rendering/xwiki-rendering-syntax-xhtml"
title: "XWiki Rendering is vulnerable to XSS attacks through insecure XHTML syntax"
description: "The XHTML syntax depended on the `xdom+xml/current` syntax which allows
  the creation of raw blocks that permit the insertion of arbitrary HTML content including
  JavaScript. This allows XSS attacks for users who can edit a document like their
  user profile (enabled by default). The attack works by setting the document's syntax
  to `xdom+xml/current` and then inserting content like\n```\n<document><p><metadata><metadata><entry><string>syntax</string><org.xwiki.rendering.syntax.Syntax><type><name>XHTML</name><id>xhtml</id><variants
  class=\"empty-list\"></variants></type><version>5</version></org.xwiki.rendering.syntax.Syntax></entry></metadata></metadata></p><rawtext
  syntax=\"html/5.0\" content=\"&lt;script&gt;alert(1);&lt;/script&gt;\"></rawtext></document>\n```\n\nThis
  has been fixed by removing the dependency on the `xdom+xml/current` syntax from
  the XHTML syntax. Note that the `xdom+xml` syntax is still vulnerable to this attack.
  As it's main purpose is testing and its use is quite difficult, this syntax shouldn't
  be installed or used on a regular wiki. We're currently not aware of any further
  dependencies on it."
