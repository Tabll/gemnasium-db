package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.rendering/xwiki-rendering-xml"
title: "XWiki vulnerable to remote code execution through insufficient protection
  against {{/html}} injection"
description: "Any user who can edit their own user profile or any other document can
  execute arbitrary script macros including Groovy and Python macros that allow remote
  code execution including unrestricted read and write access to all wiki contents.
  The reason is that rendering output is included as content of HTML macros with insufficient
  escaping, and it is thus possible to close the HTML macro and inject script macros
  that are executed with programming rights. To demonstrate, the content `{{html}}{{/html
  {{/html}}}}` can be inserted into any field of the user profile that supports wiki
  syntax like the \"About\" field. If this leads to the display of raw HTML, the instance
  is vulnerable."
