title: "Improper Neutralization of Script in Attributes in a Web Page"
description: "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Prior to version 14.6-rc-1,
  HTML rendering didn't check for dangerous attributes/attribute values. This allowed
  cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via attributes and link URLs, e.g., supported
  in XWiki syntax. This has been patched in XWiki 14.6-rc-1. There are no known workarounds
  apart from upgrading to a fixed version."
