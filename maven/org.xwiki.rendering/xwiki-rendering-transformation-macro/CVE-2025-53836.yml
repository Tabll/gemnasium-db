package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.rendering/xwiki-rendering-transformation-macro"
title: "XWiki Rendering is vulnerable to RCE attacks when processing nested macros"
description: "The default macro content parser didn't preserve the restricted attribute
  of the transformation context when executing nested macros. This allows executing
  macros that are normally forbidden in restricted mode, in particular script macros.
  The [cache](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Cache%20Macro)
  and [chart](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Chart%20Macro)
  macros that are bundled in XWiki use the vulnerable feature. The following XWiki
  syntax, when used inside a comment in XWiki, demonstrates the privilege escalation
  from comment right to programming right and thus remote code execution (RCE) that
  is possible due to this:\n\n```\n{{cache}}{{groovy}}println(\"Hello from Groovy!\"){{/groovy}}{{/cache}}\n```\n\nThis
  vulnerability exists since the restricted attribute has been added to the transformation
  context in version 4.2."
