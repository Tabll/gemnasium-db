title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED **\n\nThe value set as the DefaultLocaleResolver.LOCALE_KEY
  attribute on the session was not validated while resolving XML definition files,
  leading to possible path traversal and eventually SSRF/XXE when passing user-controlled
  data to this key. Passing user-controlled data to this key may be relatively common,
  as it was also used like that to set the language in the 'tiles-test' application
  shipped with Tiles.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Tiles from version 2 onwards.\n\nNOTE:
  This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.\n\n"
