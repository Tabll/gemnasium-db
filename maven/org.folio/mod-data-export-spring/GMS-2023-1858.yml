title: "Hard-coded System User Credentials in Folio Data Export Spring module "
description: "### Impact\nThe module creates a system user that is used to perform
  internal module-to-module operations. Credentials for this user are hard-coded in
  the source code. This makes it trivial to authenticate as this user, resulting in
  unauthorized access to potentially dangerous APIs, allowing to view and modify configuration
  including single-sign-on configuration, to read, add and modify user data, and to
  read and transfer fees/fines in a patron's account.\n\n### Patches\nUpgrade mod-data-export-spring
  to >=2.0.2, or a 1.5.x version >=1.5.4.\n\n### Workarounds\nNo known workarounds.\n\n###
