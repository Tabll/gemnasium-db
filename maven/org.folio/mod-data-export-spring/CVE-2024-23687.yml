title: "Hard-coded System User Credentials in Folio Data Export Spring module "
description: "The module creates a system user that is used to perform internal module-to-module
  operations.  Credentials for this user are hard-coded in the source code.  This
  makes it trivial to authenticate as this user, resulting in unauthorized access
  to potentially dangerous APIs, allowing to view and modify configuration including
  single-sign-on configuration, to read, add and modify user data, and to read and
  transfer fees/fines in a patron's account."
