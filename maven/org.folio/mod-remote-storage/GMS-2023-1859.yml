title: "Hard-coded System User Credentials in Folio Data Export Spring module "
description: "### Impact\nThe module creates a system user that is used to perform
  internal module-to-module operations. Credentials for this user are hard-coded in
  the source code. This makes it trivial to authenticate as this user, allowing unauthorized
  read access to these mod-inventory-storage records: instances, holdings, items,
  contributor-types, identifier-types. This includes records marked as suppressed
  from discovery.\n\n### Patches\nUpgrade mod-remote-storage to >=2.0.3, or a 1.7.x
  version >=1.7.1.\n\n### Workarounds\nNo known workarounds.\n\n### References\nhttps://wiki.folio.org/x/hbMMBw
