title: "Hard-coded System User Credentials in Folio Data Export Spring module "
description: "The module creates a system user that is used to perform internal module-to-module
  operations.  Credentials for this user are hard-coded in the source code.  This
  makes it trivial to authenticate as this user, allowing unauthorized read access
  to these mod-inventory-storage records: instances, holdings, items, contributor-types,
  identifier-types. This includes records marked as suppressed from discovery."
