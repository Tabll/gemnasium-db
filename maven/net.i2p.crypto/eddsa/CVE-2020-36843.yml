title: "Ed25519 Signature Malleability in ed25519-java Due to Missing Scalar Range
  Check"
description: "The implementation of EdDSA in EdDSA-Java (aka ed25519-java) through
  0.3.0 exhibits signature malleability and does not satisfy the SUF-CMA (Strong Existential
  Unforgeability under Chosen Message Attacks) property. This allows attackers to
  create new valid signatures different from previous signatures for a known message."
