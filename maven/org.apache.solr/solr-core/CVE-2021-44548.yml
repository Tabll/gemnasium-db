  call being made from the Solr host to another host on the network. If the attacker
  has wider access to the network, this may lead to SMB attacks, which may result
  in: * The exfiltration of sensitive data such as OS user hashes (NTLM/LM hashes),
  * In case of misconfigured systems, SMB Relay Attacks which can lead to user impersonation
  on SMB Shares or, in a worse-case scenario, Remote Code Execution This issue affects
  all Apache Solr This issue only affects Windows."
