package_slug: "maven/org.apache.solr/solr-core"
title: "Authorization Bug Disclosure"
description: "In Apache Solr, the cluster can be partitioned into multiple collections
  and only a subset of nodes actually host any given collection. If a node receives
  a request for a collection it does not host, it forwards the request to a relevant
  node and serves the request. Solr bypasses all authorization settings for such requests."
