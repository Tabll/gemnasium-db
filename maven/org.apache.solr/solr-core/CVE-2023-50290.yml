title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability
  in Apache Solr.\nThe Solr Metrics API publishes all unprotected environment variables
  available to each Apache Solr instance. Users are able to specify which environment
  variables to hide, however, the default list is designed to work for known secret
  Java system properties. Environment variables cannot be strictly defined in Solr,
  like Java system properties can be, and may be set for the entire host,Â unlike Java
  system properties which are set per-Java-proccess.\n\nThe Solr Metrics API is protected
  by the \"metrics-read\" permission.\nTherefore, Solr Clouds with Authorization setup
  will only be vulnerable via users with the \"metrics-read\" permission.\nThis issue
  affects Apache Solr: from 9.0.0 before 9.3.0.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade
  to version 9.3.0 or later, in which environment variables are not published via
  the Metrics API.\n\n"
