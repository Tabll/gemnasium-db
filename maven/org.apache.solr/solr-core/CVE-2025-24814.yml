package_slug: "maven/org.apache.solr/solr-core"
title: "Apache Solr vulnerable to Execution with Unnecessary Privileges"
description: "Core creation allows users to replace \"trusted\" configset files with
  arbitrary configuration\n\nSolr instances that (1) use the \"FileSystemConfigSetService\"
  component (the default in \"standalone\" or \"user-managed\" mode), and (2) are
  running without authentication and authorization are vulnerable to a sort of privilege
  escalation wherein individual \"trusted\" configset files can be ignored in favor
  of potentially-untrusted replacements available elsewhere on the filesystem.  These
  replacement config files are treated as \"trusted\" and can use \"<lib>\" tags to
  add to Solr's classpath, which an attacker might use to load malicious code as a
  searchComponent or other plugin.\n\nThis issue affects all Apache Solr versions
  up through Solr 9.7.  Users can protect against the vulnerability by enabling authentication
  and authorization on their Solr clusters or switching to SolrCloud (and away from
  \"FileSystemConfigSetService\").  Users are also recommended to upgrade to Solr
  9.8.0, which mitigates this issue by disabling use of \"<lib>\" tags by default."
