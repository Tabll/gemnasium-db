identifier: "CVE-2017-3163"
package_slug: "maven/org.apache.solr/solr-core"
title: "Path traversal attack"
description: "When using the Index Replication feature, Apache Solr nodes can pull
  index files from a master/leader node using an HTTP API which accepts a file name
  Solr does not validate the file name, hence it is possible to craft a special request
  involving path traversal, leaving any file readable to the Solr server process exposed.
  Solr servers protected and restricted by firewall rules and/or authentication would
  not be at risk since only trusted clients and users would gain direct HTTP access."
