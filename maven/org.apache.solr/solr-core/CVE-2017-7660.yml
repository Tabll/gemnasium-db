identifier: "CVE-2017-7660"
package_slug: "maven/org.apache.solr/solr-core"
title: "Security Vulnerability in secure inter-node communication"
description: "This package uses a PKI based mechanism to secure inter-node communication
  when security is enabled. It is possible to create a specially crafted node name
  that does not exist as part of the cluster and point it to a malicious node. This
  can trick the nodes in cluster to believe that the malicious node is a member of
  the cluster. So, if Solr users have enabled BasicAuth authentication mechanism using
  the BasicAuthPlugin or if the user has implemented a custom Authentication plugin,
  which does not implement either `HttpClientInterceptorPlugin` or `HttpClientBuilderPlugin`,
  his/her servers are vulnerable to this attack. Users who only use SSL without basic
  authentication or those who use Kerberos are not affected."
