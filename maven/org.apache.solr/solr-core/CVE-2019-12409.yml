  configuration option in the default `solr. then JMX monitoring will be enabled and
  exposed on `RMI_PORT` (`default=18983`), without any authentication. If this port

  to your Solr nodes will be able to access JMX, which may in turn allow them to upload
  malicious code for execution on the Solr server."
