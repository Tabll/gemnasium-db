title: "Improper Authentication vulnerability in Apache Solr"
description: "Solr instances using the PKIAuthenticationPlugin, which is enabled by
  default when Solr Authentication is used, are vulnerable to Authentication bypass.
  A fake ending at the end of any Solr API URL path, will allow requests to skip Authentication
  while maintaining the API contract with the original URL Path. This fake ending
  looks like an unprotected API path, however it is stripped off internally after
  authentication but before API routing.\n\n\nThis issue affects Apache Solr: from
  5.3.0 before 8.11.4, from 9.0.0 before 9.7.0.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade
  to version 9.7.0, or 8.11.4, which fix the issue."
