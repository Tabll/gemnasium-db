package_slug: "maven/org.apache.solr/solr-parent"
title: "Incorrect Authorization"
description: "In Apache Solr, the cluster can be partitioned into multiple collections
  and only a subset of nodes actually host any given collection. However, if a node
  receives a request for a collection it does not host, it proxies the request to
  a relevant node and serves the request. Solr bypasses all authorization settings
  for such requests. This affects all Solr versions prior to 7.7 that use the default
  authorization mechanism of Solr (RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin)."
