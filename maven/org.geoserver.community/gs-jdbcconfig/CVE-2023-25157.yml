title: "GeoServer OGC Filter SQL Injection Vulnerabilities"
description: "GeoServer is an open source software server written in Java that allows
  users to share and edit geospatial data. GeoServer includes support for the OGC
  Filter expression language and the OGC Common Query Language (CQL) as part of the
  Web Feature Service (WFS) and Web Map Service (WMS) protocols. CQL is also supported
  through the Web Coverage Service (WCS) protocol for ImageMosaic coverages. Users
  are advised to upgrade to either version 2.21.4, or version 2.22.2 to resolve this
  issue. Users unable to upgrade should disable the PostGIS Datastore *encode functions*
  setting to mitigate ``strEndsWith``, ``strStartsWith`` and ``PropertyIsLike `` misuse
  and enable the PostGIS DataStore *preparedStatements* setting to mitigate the ``FeatureId``
  misuse."
