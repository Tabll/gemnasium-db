title: "Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity"
description: "We failed to apply the fix for CVE-2022-30126 to the 1.x branch in the
  1.28.2 release. In Apache Tika, a regular expression in the StandardsText class,
  used by the StandardsExtractingContentHandler could lead to a denial of service
  caused by backtracking on a specially crafted file. This only affects users who
  are running the StandardsExtractingContentHandler, which is a non-standard handler.
  This is fixed in 1.28.3."
