title: "Apache Tika has XXE vulnerability"
description: "Critical XXE in Apache Tika tika-core (1.13-3.2.1), tika-pdf-module
  (2.0.0-3.2.1) and tika-parsers (1.13-1.28.5) modules on all platforms allows an
  attacker to carry out XML External Entity injection via a crafted XFA file inside
  of a PDF.\n\nThis CVE covers the same vulnerability as in CVE-2025-54988. However,
  this CVE expands the scope of affected packages in two ways.\n\nFirst, while the
  entrypoint for the vulnerability was the tika-parser-pdf-module as reported in CVE-2025-54988,
  the vulnerability and its fix were in tika-core. Users who upgraded the tika-parser-pdf-module
  but did not upgrade tika-core to >= 3.2.2 would still be vulnerable.\n\nSecond,
  the original report failed to mention that in the 1.x Tika releases, the PDFParser
  was in the \"org.apache.tika:tika-parsers\" module."
