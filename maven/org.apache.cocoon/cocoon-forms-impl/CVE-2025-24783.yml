title: "Apache Cocoon vulnerable to Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number
  Generator"
description: "Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) vulnerability
  in Apache Cocoon.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Cocoon: all versions.\n\nWhen a continuation
  is created, it gets a random identifier. Because the random number generator used
  to generate these identifiers was seeded with the startup time, it may not have
  been sufficiently unpredictable, and an attacker could use this to guess continuation
  ids and look up continuations they should not have had access to.\n\nAs a mitigation,
  you may enable the \"session-bound-continuations\" option to make sure continuations
  are not shared across sessions.\n\n\nAs this project is retired, we do not plan
  to release a version that fixes this issue. Users are recommended to find an alternative
  or restrict access to the instance to trusted users.\n\nNOTE: This vulnerability
  only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer."
