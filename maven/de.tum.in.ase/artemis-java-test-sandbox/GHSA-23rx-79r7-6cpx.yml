title: "Duplicate Advisory: Sandbox escape in Artemis Java Test Sandbox"
description: "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-883x-6fch-6wjx. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n## Original Description\nArtemis Java Test Sandbox versions less
  than 1.7.6 are vulnerable to a sandbox escape when an attacker crafts a special
  subclass of InvocationTargetException. An attacker can abuse this issue to execute
  arbitrary Java when a victim executes the supposedly sandboxed code."
