package_slug: "maven/de.tum.in.ase/artemis-java-test-sandbox"
title: "Trust Boundary Violation due to Incomplete `Blacklist` in Test Failure Processing
  in Ares"
description: "This allows an attacker to create special subclasses of `InvocationTargetException`
  that escape the exception sanitization because JUnit extracts the cause in a trusted
  context before the exception reaches Ares. This means that arbitrary student code
  can be executed in a trusted context, and that in turn allows disabling Ares and
  having full control over the system."
