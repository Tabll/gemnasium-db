title: "Duplicate Advisory: Sandbox escape in Artemis Java Test Sandbox"
description: "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-98hq-4wmw-98w9. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n## Original Description\nArtemis Java Test Sandbox versions before
  1.11.2 are vulnerable to a sandbox escape when an attacker loads untrusted libraries
  using System.load or System.loadLibrary. An attacker can abuse this issue to execute
  arbitrary Java when a victim executes the supposedly sandboxed code."
