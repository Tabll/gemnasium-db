title: "Duplicate Advisory: Sandbox escape in Artemis Java Test Sandbox"
description: "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-227w-wv4j-67h4. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n## Original Description\nArtemis Java Test Sandbox versions before
  1.8.0 are vulnerable to a sandbox escape when an attacker includes class files in
  a package that Ares trusts. An attacker can abuse this issue to execute arbitrary
  Java when a victim executes the supposedly sandboxed code."
