package_slug: "maven/org.hl7.fhir.publisher/org.hl7.fhir.publisher.cli"
title: "HL7 FHIR IG Publisher potentially exposes GitHub repo user and credential
  information"
description: "In CI contexts, the IG Publisher CLI uses git commands to determine
  the URL of the originating repo. If the repo was cloned, or otherwise set to use
  a repo that uses a username and credential based URL, the entire URL will be included
  in the built Implementation Guide, exposing username and credential. This does not
  impact users that clone public repos without credentials, such as those using the
  auto-ig-build continuous integration infrastructure."
