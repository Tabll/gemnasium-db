title: "Quarkus potentially leaks data when duplicating a duplicated context"
description: "Vert.x 4.5.12 has changed the semantics of the duplication of duplicated
  context.\n\nDuplicated context is an object used to propagate data through a processing
  (synchronous or asynchronous). Each \"transaction\" or \"processing\" runs on its
  own isolated duplicated context.\n\nInitially, duplicating a duplicated context
  was creating a fresh (empty) new context, meaning that the new duplicated context
  can be used to managed a separated transaction.\n\nIn Vert.x 4.5.12, this semantics
  has changed, and since the content of the parent duplicated context is copied into
  the new one, potentially leaking data.\n\nThis CVE is especially for Quarkus as
  Quarkus extensively uses the Vert.x duplicated context to implement context propagation.
  With the new semantic data from one transaction can leak to the data from another
  transaction. From a Vert.x point of view, this new semantic clarifies the behavior.\n\nA
  significant amount of data is stored in the duplicated context, including request
  scope, security details, and metadata. Duplicating a duplicated context is rather
  rare and is only done in a few places:\n\n- Quarkus REST Client when using OTel
  (but it's the same transaction, so no leak)\n- Quarkus Messaging connectors\n- Quarkus
  SmallRye Health (same transaction, so no leak)"
