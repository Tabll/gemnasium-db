title: "quarkus-core leaks local environment variables from Quarkus namespace during
  application's build"
description: "A vulnerability was found in the quarkus-core component. Quarkus captures
  the local environment variables from the Quarkus namespace during the application's
  build. Thus, running the resulting application inherits the values captured at build
  time.\n\nHowever, some local environment variables may have been set by the developer
  / CI environment for testing purposes, such as dropping the database during the
  application startup or trusting all TLS certificates to accept self-signed certificates.
  If these properties are configured using environment variables or the .env facility,
  they are captured into the built application. It may lead to dangerous behavior
  if the application does not override these values.\n\nThis behavior only happens
  for configuration properties from the `quarkus.*` namespace. So, application-specific
  properties are not captured."
