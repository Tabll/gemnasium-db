package_slug: "maven/io.quarkus/quarkus-cache"
title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "A flaw was found in the Quarkus Cache Runtime. When request processing
  utilizes a Uni cached using @CacheResult and the cached Uni reuses the initial \"completion\"
  context, the processing switches to the cached Uni instead of the request context.
  This is a problem if the cached Uni context contains sensitive information, and
  could allow a malicious user to benefit from a POST request returning the response
  that is meant for another user, gaining access to sensitive data."
