title: "Quarkus REST has potential worker thread starvation when HTTP connection is
  closed while waiting to write"
description: "A vulnerability exists in the HTTP layer of Quarkus REST related to
  response handling. When a response is being written, the framework waits for previously
  written response chunks to be fully transmitted before proceeding. If the client
  connection is dropped during this waiting period, the associated worker thread is
  never released and becomes permanently blocked. Under sustained or repeated occurrences,
  this can exhaust the available worker threads, leading to degraded performance,
  or complete unavailability of the application."
