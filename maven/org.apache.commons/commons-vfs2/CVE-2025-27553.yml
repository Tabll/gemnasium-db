title: "Apache Commons VFS Has Relative Path Traversal Vulnerability"
description: "Relative Path Traversal vulnerability in Apache Commons VFS before 2.10.0.\n\nThe
  FileObject API in Commons VFS has a 'resolveFile' method that\ntakes a 'scope' parameter.
  Specifying 'NameScope.DESCENDENT' promises that \"an exception is thrown if the
  resolved file is not a descendent of\nthe base file\". However, when the path contains
  encoded \"..\"\ncharacters (for example, \"%2E%2E/bar.txt\"), it might return file
  objects that are not\na descendent of the base file, without throwing an exception.\nThis
  issue affects Apache Commons VFS: before 2.10.0.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade
  to version 2.10.0, which fixes the issue."
