title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "A flaw was found in codeplex-codehaus. A directory traversal attack
  (also known as path traversal) aims to access files and directories stored outside
  the intended folder. By manipulating files with \"dot-dot-slash (../)\" sequences
  and their variations or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access
  arbitrary files and directories stored on the file system, including application
  source code, configuration, and other critical system files."
