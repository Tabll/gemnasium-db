title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "JStachio is a type-safe Java Mustache templating engine. Prior to version
  1.0.1, JStachio fails to escape single quotes `'` in HTML, allowing an attacker
  to inject malicious code. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to
  execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users visiting pages that
  use this template engine. This can lead to various consequences, including session
  hijacking, defacement of web pages, theft of sensitive information, or even the
  propagation of malware.\n\nVersion 1.0.1 contains a patch for this issue. To mitigate
  this vulnerability, the template engine should properly escape special characters,
  including single quotes. Common practice is to escape `'` as `&#39`. As a workaround,
  users can avoid this issue by using only double quotes `\"` for HTML attributes."
