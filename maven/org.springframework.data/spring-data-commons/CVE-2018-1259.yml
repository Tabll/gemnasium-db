description: "Spring Data Commons, versions 1.13 prior to 1.13.12 and 2.0 prior to
  2.0.7, used in combination with XMLBeam 1.4.14 or earlier versions, contains a property
  binder vulnerability caused by improper restriction of XML external entity references

  unauthenticated remote malicious user can supply specially crafted request parameters
  against Spring Data's projection-based request payload binding to access arbitrary
  files on the system."
