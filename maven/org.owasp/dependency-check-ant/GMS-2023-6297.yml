title: "nvdApiKey is logged in debug mode"
description: "### Summary\nThe value of `nvdApiKey` configuration parameter is logged
  in clear text in debug mode.\n\n### Details\nThe NVD API key is a kind of secret
  and should be treated like other secrets when logging in debug mode.\nExpecting
  the same behavior as for several password configurations: just print `******`\n\nNote
  that while the NVD API Key is an access token for the NVD API - they are not that
  sensitive. The only thing an NVD API Token grants is a higher rate limit when making
  calls to publicly available data. The data available from the NVD API is the same
  whether you have an API Key or not.\n\n### PoC\nThe nvdApiKey is configured to use
  an environment variable; when running `mvn -X dependency-check:check` the clear
  value is logged twice.\n\n### Impact\nThe NVD API key is a kind of secret and should
  not be exposed. If stolen, an attacker can use this key to obtain already public
  information.\n\n"
