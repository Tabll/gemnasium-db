title: "Authentication Bypass by Spoofing"
description: "Nacos is a platform designed for dynamic service discovery and configuration
  and service management. In Nacos before version 1.4.1, when configured to use authentication
  (-Dnacos.core.auth.enabled=true) Nacos uses the AuthFilter servlet filter to enforce
  authentication. This filter has a backdoor that enables Nacos servers to bypass
  this filter and therefore skip authentication checks. This mechanism relies on the
  user-agent HTTP header so it can be easily spoofed. This issue may allow any user
  to carry out any administrative tasks on the Nacos server."
