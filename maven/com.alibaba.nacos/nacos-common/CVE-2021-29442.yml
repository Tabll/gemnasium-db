package_slug: "maven/com.alibaba.nacos/nacos-common"
title: "Missing Authentication for Critical Function"
description: "Nacos is a platform designed for dynamic service discovery and configuration
  and service management. In Nacos before version 1.4.1, the ConfigOpsController lets
  the user perform management operations like querying the database or even wiping
  it out. While the /data/remove endpoint is properly protected with the @Secured
  annotation, the /derby endpoint is not protected and can be openly accessed by unauthenticated
  users. These endpoints are only valid when using embedded storage (derby DB) so
  this issue should not affect those installations using external storage (e.g. mysql)"
