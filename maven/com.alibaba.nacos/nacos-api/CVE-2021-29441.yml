identifier: "CVE-2021-29441"
package_slug: "maven/com.alibaba.nacos/nacos-api"
title: "Authentication Bypass by Spoofing"
description: "Nacos is a platform designed for dynamic service discovery 
  and configuration and service management. In Nacos, when configured to 
  use authentication `-Dnacos.core.auth.enabled=true` it uses the `AuthFilter` 
  servlet filter to enforce authentication. This filter has a backdoor that 
  enables Nacos servers to bypass this filter and therefore skip authentication 
  checks. This mechanism relies on the user-agent HTTP header so it can be 
  easily spoofed. This issue may allow any user to carry out any administrative
  tasks on the Nacos server."
