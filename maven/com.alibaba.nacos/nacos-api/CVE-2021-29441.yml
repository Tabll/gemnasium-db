identifier: "CVE-2021-29441"
package_slug: "maven/com.alibaba.nacos/nacos-api"
title: "Authentication Bypass by Spoofing"
description: "Nacos is a platform designed for dynamic service discovery and configuration
  and service management. In Nacos, when configured to use authentication `-Dnacos.core.auth.enabled=true`
  it uses the `AuthFilter` servlet filter to enforce authentication. This filter has
  a backdoor that enables Nacos servers to bypass this filter and therefore skip authentication
  checks. This mechanism relies on the user-agent HTTP header so it can be easily
  spoofed. This issue may allow any user to carry out any administrative tasks on
  the Nacos server."
