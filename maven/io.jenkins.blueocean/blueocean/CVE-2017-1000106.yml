identifier: "CVE-2017-1000106"
package_slug: "maven/io.jenkins.blueocean/blueocean"
title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "Blue Ocean allows the creation of GitHub organization folders that are
  set up to scan a GitHub organization for repositories and branches containing a
  Jenkinsfile, and create corresponding pipelines in Jenkins. Its SCM content REST
  API supports the pipeline creation and editing feature in Blue Ocean. The SCM content
  REST API does not check the current user's authentication or credentials. If the
  GitHub organization folder is created via Blue Ocean, it retains a reference to
  its creator's GitHub credentials. This allows users with read access to the GitHub
  organization folder to create arbitrary commits in the repositories inside the GitHub
  organization corresponding to the GitHub organization folder with the GitHub credentials
  of the creator of the organization folder."
