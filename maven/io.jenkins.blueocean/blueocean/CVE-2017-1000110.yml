identifier: "CVE-2017-1000110"
package_slug: "maven/io.jenkins.blueocean/blueocean"
title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "Blue Ocean allows the creation of GitHub organization folders that are
  set up to scan a GitHub organization for repositories and branches containing a
  Jenkinsfile, and create corresponding pipelines in Jenkins. It does not properly
  check the current user's authentication and authorization when configuring existing
  GitHub organization folders. This allows users with read access to the GitHub organization
  folder to reconfigure it, including changing the GitHub API endpoint for the organization
  folder to an attacker-controlled server to obtain the GitHub access token, if the
  organization folder is initially created using Blue Ocean."
