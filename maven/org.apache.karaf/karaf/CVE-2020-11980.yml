identifier: "CVE-2020-11980"
package_slug: "maven/org.apache.karaf/karaf"
title: "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
description: "In Karaf, JMX authentication takes place using JAAS and authorization
  takes place using ACL files. By default, only an \"admin\" can actually invoke on
  an MBean. However, there is a vulnerability there for someone who is not an admin,
  but has a \"viewer\" role. It's possible to authenticate as a viewer role taht invokes
  on the MLet `getMBeansFromURL` method, which goes off to a remote server to fetch
  the desired MBean, which is then registered in Karaf. At this point the attack fails
  as \"viewer\" does not have the permission to invoke on the MBean. Still, it could
  act as a SSRF style attack and also it essentially allows a \"viewer\" role to pollute
  the MBean registry, which is a kind of privilege escalation. The vulnerability is
  low as it's possible to add an ACL to limit access."
