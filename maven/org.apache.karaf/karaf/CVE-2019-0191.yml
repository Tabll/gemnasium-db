identifier: "CVE-2019-0191"
package_slug: "maven/org.apache.karaf/karaf"
title: "Path Traversal"
description: "Apache Karaf kar deployer reads `.kar` archives and extracts the paths
  from the `repository/` and `resources/` entries in the zip file. It then writes
  out the content of these paths to the Karaf repo and resources directories. However,
  it does not do any validation on the paths in the zip file. This means that a malicious
  user could craft a .kar file with `..` directory names and break out of the directories
  to write arbitrary content to the filesystem."
