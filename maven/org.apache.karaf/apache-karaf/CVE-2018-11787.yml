package_slug: "maven/org.apache.karaf/apache-karaf"
title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "In Apache Karaf version prior to 3.0.9, 4.0.9, 4.1.1, when the webconsole
  feature is installed in Karaf, it is available at .../system/console and requires
  authentication to access it. One part of the console is a Gogo shell/console that
  gives access to the command line console of Karaf via a Web browser, and when navigated
  to it is available at .../system/console/gogo. Trying to go directly to that URL
  does require authentication. And optional bundle that some applications use is the
  Pax Web Extender Whiteboard, it is part of the pax-war feature and perhaps others.
  When it is installed, the Gogo console becomes available at another URL .../gogo/,
  and that URL is not secured giving access to the Karaf console to unauthenticated
  users. A mitigation for the issue is to manually stop/uninstall Gogo plugin bundle
  that is installed with the webconsole feature, although of course this removes the
  console from the .../system/console application, not only from the unauthenticated
  endpoint. One could also stop/uninstall the Pax Web Extender Whiteboard, but other
  components/applications may require it and so their functionality would be reduced/compromised."
