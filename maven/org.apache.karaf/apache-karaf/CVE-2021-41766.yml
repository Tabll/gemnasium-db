title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "Apache Karaf allows monitoring of applications and the Java runtime
  by using the Java Management Extensions (JMX). JMX is a Java RMI based technology
  that relies on Java serialized objects for client server communication. Whereas
  the default JMX implementation is hardened against unauthenticated deserialization
  attacks, the implementation used by Apache Karaf is not protected against this kind
  of attack. The impact of Java deserialization vulnerabilities strongly depends on
  the classes that are available within the targets class path. Generally speaking,
  deserialization of untrusted data does always represent a high security risk and
  should be prevented. The risk is low as, by default, Karaf uses a limited set of
  classes in the JMX server class path. It depends of system scoped classes (e.g.
  jar in the lib folder)."
