title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "Apache Karaf obr:* commands and run goal on the karaf-maven-plugin have
  partial path traversal which allows to break out of expected folder. The risk is

  fixed in revision: https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=karaf.git;h=36a2bc4 https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=karaf.git;h=52b70cf
  Mitigation: Apache Karaf users should upgrade to 4.2.15 or 4.3.6 or later as soon
