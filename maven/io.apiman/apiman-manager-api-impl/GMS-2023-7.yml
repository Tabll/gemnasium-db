title: "Apiman Manager API affected by Jackson denial of service vulnerability"
description: "### Impact\n\nDue to a vulnerability in `jackson-databind <= 2.12.6.0`,
  an authenticated attacker could craft an Apiman policy configuration which, when
  saved, may cause a denial of service on the Apiman Manager API.\n\nThis does **not**
  affect the Apiman Gateway.\n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrade to Apiman 3.0.0.Final or later.\n\nIf
  you are using an older version of Apiman and need to remain on that version, contact
  your Apiman [support provider](https://www.apiman.io/support.html) for advice/long-term
  support.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf all users of the Apiman Manager are trusted then
  you may assess this is low risk, as an account is required to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n###
