title: "Duplicate Advisory: Apiman has insufficient checks for read permissions"
description: "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-j94p-hv25-rm5g. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n## Original Description\nApiman 1.5.7 through 2.2.3.Final has insufficient
  checks for read permissions within the Apiman Manager REST API. A malicious user
  may be able to find and subscribe to private APIs they do not have permission for,
  thus accessing API Management-protected resources they should not be allowed to
  access. The root cause of the issue is the Apiman project's accidental acceptance
  of a large contribution that was not fully compatible with the security model of
  Apiman versions before 3.0.0.Final. Because of this, 3.0.0.Final is not affected
  by the vulnerability."
