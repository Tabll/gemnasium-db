title: "Apiman has insufficient checks for read permissions"
description: "Apiman 1.5.7 through 2.2.3.Final has insufficient checks for read permissions
  within the Apiman Manager REST API. The root cause of the issue is the Apiman project's
  accidental acceptance of a large contribution that was not fully compatible with
  the security model of Apiman versions before 3.0.0.Final. Because of this, 3.0.0.Final
  is not affected by the vulnerability."
