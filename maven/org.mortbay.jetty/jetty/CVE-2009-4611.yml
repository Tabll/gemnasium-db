description: "Mort Bay Jetty 6.x through 6.1.22 and 7.0.0 writes backtrace data without

  an HTTP request containing an escape sequence for a terminal emulator, related to
  (1) a string value in the Age parameter to the default URI for the Cookie Dump Servlet
  in test-jetty-webapp/src/main/java/com/acme/CookieDump.java under cookie/, (2) an
  alphabetic value in the A parameter to jsp/expr.jsp, or (3) an alphabetic value
