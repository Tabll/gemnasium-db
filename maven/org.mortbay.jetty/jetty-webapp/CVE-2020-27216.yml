title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command
  Injection')"
description: "In Eclipse Jetty versions 1.0 thru 9.4.32.v20200930, 10.0.0.alpha1 thru
  10.0.0.beta2, and 11.0.0.alpha1 thru 11.0.0.beta2O, on Unix like systems, the system's
  temporary directory is shared between all users on that system. A collocated user
  can observe the process of creating a temporary sub directory in the shared temporary
  directory and race to complete the creation of the temporary subdirectory. If the
  attacker wins the race then they will have read and write permission to the subdirectory
  used to unpack web applications, including their WEB-INF/lib jar files and JSP files.
  If any code is ever executed out of this temporary directory, this can lead to a
  local privilege escalation vulnerability."
