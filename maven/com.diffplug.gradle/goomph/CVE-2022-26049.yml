package_slug: "maven/com.diffplug.gradle/goomph"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command
  Injection')"
description: "This affects the package com.diffplug.gradle:goomph before 3.37.2. It
  allows a malicious zip file to potentially break out of the expected destination
  directory, writing contents into arbitrary locations on the file system. Overwriting
  certain files/directories could allow an attacker to achieve remote code execution
  on a target system by exploiting this vulnerability. **Note:** This could have allowed
  a malicious zip file to extract itself into an arbitrary directory. The only file
  that Goomph extracts is the p2 bootstrapper and eclipse metadata files hosted at
  eclipse.org, which are not malicious, so the only way this vulnerability could have
  affected you is if you had set a custom bootstrap zip, and that zip was malicious."
