title: "wildfly-core allows user with access to management interface to access vault
  expression, retrieve item from vault"
description: "A flaw was found in wildfly-core in all versions. If a vault expression
  is in the form of a single attribute that contains multiple expressions, a user
  who was granted access to the management interface can potentially access a vault
  expression they should not be able to access and possibly retrieve the item which
  was stored in the vault. The highest threat from this vulnerability is data confidentiality
  and integrity."
