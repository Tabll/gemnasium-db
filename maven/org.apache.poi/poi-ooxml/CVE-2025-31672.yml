title: "Apache POI OOXML Vulnerable to Improper Input Validation in OOXML File Parsing"
description: "Improper Input Validation vulnerability in Apache POI. The issue affects
  the parsing of OOXML format files like xlsx, docx and pptx. These file formats are
  basically zip files and it is possible for malicious users to add zip entries with
  duplicate names (including the path) in the zip. In this case, products reading
  the affected file could read different data because 1 of the zip entries with the
  duplicate name is selected over another but different products may choose a different
  zip entry.\nThis issue affects Apache POI poi-ooxml before 5.4.0. poi-ooxml 5.4.0
  has a check that throws an exception if zip entries with duplicate file names are
  found in the input file.\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version poi-ooxml
  5.4.0, which fixes the issue. Please read  https://poi.apache.org/security.html
  \ for recommendations about how to use the POI libraries securely."
