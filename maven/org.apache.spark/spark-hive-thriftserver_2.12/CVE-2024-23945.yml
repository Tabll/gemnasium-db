title: "Apache Hive and Spark: CookieSigner exposes the correct signature when message
  verification fails"
description: "Signing cookies is an application security feature that adds a digital
  signature to cookie data to verify its authenticity and integrity. The signature
  helps prevent malicious actors from modifying the cookie value, which can lead to
  security vulnerabilities and exploitation. Apache Hive’s service component accidentally
  exposes the signed cookie to the end user when there is a mismatch in signature
  between the current and expected cookie. Exposing the correct cookie signature can
  lead to further exploitation.\n\nThe vulnerable CookieSigner logic was introduced
  in Apache Hive by HIVE-9710 (1.2.0) and in Apache Spark by SPARK-14987 (2.0.0).
  The affected components are the following:\n* org.apache.hive:hive-service\n* org.apache.spark:spark-hive-thriftserver_2.11\n*
  org.apache.spark:spark-hive-thriftserver_2.12"
