package_slug: "maven/org.apache.spark/spark-core_2.11"
title: "Improper Input Validation in Apache Spark"
description: "Spark's Apache Maven-based build includes a convenience script, 'build/mvn',
  that downloads and runs a zinc server to speed up compilation. It has been included
  in release branches since 1.3.x, up to and including master. This server will accept
  connections from external hosts by default. A specially-crafted request to the zinc
  server could cause it to reveal information in files readable to the developer account
  running the build. **Note that this issue does not affect end users of Spark, only
  developers building Spark from source code.**"
