identifier: "CVE-2017-7678"
package_slug: "maven/org.apache.spark/spark-core_2.11"
title: "Cross-site Scripting"
description: "It is possible for an attacker to take advantage of a user's trust in
  the server to trick them into visiting a link that points to a shared Spark cluster
  and submits data including MHTML to the Spark master, or history server. This data,
  which could contain a script, would then be reflected back to the user and could
  be evaluated and executed by MS Windows-based clients. It is not an attack on Spark
  itself, but on the user, who may then execute the script inadvertently when viewing
  elements of the Spark web UIs."
