title: "Apache Spark Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability"
description: "In Apache Spark 1.6.0 until 2.1.1, the launcher API performs unsafe
  deserialization of data received by its socket. This makes applications launched
  programmatically using the launcher API potentially vulnerable to arbitrary code
  execution by an attacker with access to any user account on the local machine. It
  does not affect apps run by spark-submit or spark-shell. The attacker would be able
  to execute code as the user that ran the Spark application. Users are encouraged
  to update to version 2.1.2, 2.2.0 or later."
