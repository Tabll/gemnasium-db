title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "In Apache Spark 2.1.0 to 2.1.2, 2.2.0 to 2.2.1, and 2.3.0, it's possible
  for a malicious user to construct a URL pointing to a Spark cluster's UI's job and
  stage info pages, and if a user can be tricked into accessing the URL, can be used
  to cause script to execute and expose information from the user's view of the Spark
  UI. While some browsers like recent versions of Chrome and Safari are able to block
  this type of attack, current versions of Firefox (and possibly others) do not."
