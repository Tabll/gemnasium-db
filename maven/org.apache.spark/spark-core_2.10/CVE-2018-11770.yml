package_slug: "maven/org.apache.spark/spark-core_2.10"
title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "From version 1.3.0 onward, Apache Spark's standalone master exposes
  a REST API for job submission, in addition to the submission mechanism used by spark-submit.
  In standalone, the config property 'spark.authenticate.secret' establishes a shared
  secret for authenticating requests to submit jobs via spark-submit. However, the
  REST API does not use this or any other authentication mechanism, and this is not
  adequately documented. In this case, a user would be able to run a driver program
  without authenticating, but not launch executors, using the REST API. This REST
  API is also used by Mesos, when set up to run in cluster mode (i.e., when also running
  MesosClusterDispatcher), for job submission. Future versions of Spark will improve
  documentation on these points, and prohibit setting 'spark.authenticate.secret'
  when running the REST APIs, to make this clear. Future versions will also disable
  the REST API by default in the standalone master by changing the default value of
  'spark.master.rest.enabled' to 'false'."
