package_slug: "maven/org.apache.spark/spark-core_2.10"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "In Apache Spark before 2.2.0, it is possible for an attacker to take
  advantage of a user's trust in the server to trick them into visiting a link that
  points to a shared Spark cluster and submits data including MHTML to the Spark master,
  or history server. This data, which could contain a script, would then be reflected
  back to the user and could be evaluated and executed by MS Windows-based clients.
  It is not an attack on Spark itself, but on the user, who may then execute the script
  inadvertently when viewing elements of the Spark web UIs."
