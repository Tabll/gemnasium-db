title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')"
description: "** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** The Apache Spark UI offers the possibility
  to enable ACLs via the configuration option spark.acls.enable. With an authentication
  filter, this checks whether a user has access permissions to view or modify the
  application. If ACLs are enabled, a code path in HttpSecurityFilter can allow someone
  to perform impersonation by providing an arbitrary user name. A malicious user might
  then be able to reach a permission check function that will ultimately build a Unix
  shell command based on their input, and execute it. This will result in arbitrary
  shell command execution as the user Spark is currently running as. This issue was
  disclosed earlier as CVE-2022-33891, but incorrectly claimed version 3.1.3 (which
  has since gone EOL) would not be affected.\n\nNOTE: This vulnerability only affects
  products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.\n\nUsers are recommended
  to upgrade to a supported version of Apache Spark, such as version 3.4.0.\n\n\n"
