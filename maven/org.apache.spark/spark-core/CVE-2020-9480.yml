identifier: "CVE-2020-9480"
package_slug: "maven/org.apache.spark/spark-core"
title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "In Apache Spark, a standalone resource manager's master may be configured
  to require authentication (`spark.authenticate`) via a shared secret. When enabled,
  however, a specially-crafted RPC to the master can succeed in starting an application's
  resources on the Spark cluster, even without the shared key. This can be leveraged
  to execute shell commands on the host machine. This does not affect Spark clusters
  using other resource managers (YARN, Mesos, etc)."
