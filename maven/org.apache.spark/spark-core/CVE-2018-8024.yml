package_slug: "maven/org.apache.spark/spark-core"
title: "Information Exposure"
description: "In Apache Spark it is possible for a malicious user to construct a URL
  pointing to a Spark cluster UI job and stage info pages, and if a user can be tricked
  into accessing the URL, can be used to cause script to execute and expose information
  from the user view of the Spark UI. While some browsers like recent versions of
  Chrome and Safari are able to block this type of attack, current versions of Firefox
  (and possibly others) do not."
