identifier: "CVE-2018-11804"
package_slug: "maven/org.apache.spark/spark-core"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "The Apache Spark Maven-based build includes a convenience script, `build/mvn`,
  that downloads and runs a zinc server to speed up compilation. It has been included
  in release branches since, up to and including master. This server will accept connections
  from external hosts by default. A specially-crafted request to the zinc server could
  cause it to reveal information in files readable to the developer account running
  the build."
