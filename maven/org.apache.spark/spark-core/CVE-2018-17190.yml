identifier: "CVE-2018-17190"
package_slug: "maven/org.apache.spark/spark-core"
title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "In all versions of Apache Spark, the standalone resource manager accepts
  code to execute on a `master` host, that then runs that code on `worker` hosts.
  The master itself does not, by design, execute user code. A specially-crafted request
  to the master can, however, cause the master to execute code too. Note that this
  does not affect standalone clusters with authentication enabled. While the master
  host typically has less outbound access to other resources than a worker, the execution
  of code on the master is nevertheless unexpected."

  secured from unwanted access."
