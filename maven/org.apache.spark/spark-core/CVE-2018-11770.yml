identifier: "CVE-2018-11770"
package_slug: "maven/org.apache.spark/spark-core"
title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "Apache Spark standalone master exposes a REST API for job submission,
  in addition to the submission mechanism used by spark-submit. In standalone, the
  config property `spark.authenticate.secret` establishes a shared secret for authenticating
  requests to submit jobs via spark-submit. However, the REST API does not use this
  or any other authentication mechanism, and this is not adequately documented. In
  this case, a user would be able to run a driver program without authenticating,
  but not launch executors, using the REST API."
