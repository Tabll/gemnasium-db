title: "Buffer not correctly recycled in Gzip Request inflation"
description: "In Eclipse Jetty if GZIP request body inflation is enabled and requests 
  from different clients are multiplexed onto a single connection, and if an attacker 
  can send a request with a body that is received entirely but not consumed by the 
  application, then a subsequent request on the same connection will see that body 
  prepended to its body. The attacker will not see any data but may inject data into 
  the body of the subsequent request."
