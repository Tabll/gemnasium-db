title: "Apache Spark vulnerable to Improper Privilege Management"
description: "In Apache Spark versions prior to versions 3.4.0 and 3.3.3, applications
  using spark-submit can specify a `proxy-user` to run as, limiting privileges. The
  application can execute code with the privileges of the submitting user, however,
  by providing malicious configuration-related classes on the classpath. This affects
  architectures relying on proxy-user, for example those using Apache Livy to manage
  submitted applications.\n\nUpdate to Apache Spark 3.4.0, 3.3.3, or later, and ensure
  that spark.submit.proxyUser.allowCustomClasspathInClusterMode is set to its default
  of \"false\", and is not overridden by submitted applications."
