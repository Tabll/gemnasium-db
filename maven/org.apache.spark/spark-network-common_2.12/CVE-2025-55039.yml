title: "Apache Spark has Inadequate Encryption Strength"
description: "This issue affects Apache Spark versions before  3.4.4, 3.5.2 and 4.0.0.\n\nApache
  Spark versions before 4.0.0, 3.5.2 and 3.4.4 use an insecure default network encryption
  cipher for RPC communication between nodes.\n\nWhen spark.network.crypto.enabled
  is set to true (it is set to false by default), but spark.network.crypto.cipher
  is not explicitly configured, Spark defaults to AES in CTR mode (AES/CTR/NoPadding),
  which provides encryption without authentication.\n\nThis vulnerability allows a
  man-in-the-middle attacker to modify encrypted RPC traffic undetected by flipping
  bits in ciphertext, potentially compromising heartbeat messages or application data
  and affecting the integrity of Spark workflows.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, users
  should either configure spark.network.crypto.cipher to AES/GCM/NoPadding to enable
  authenticated encryption or enable SSL encryption by setting spark.ssl.enabled to
  true, which provides stronger transport security."
