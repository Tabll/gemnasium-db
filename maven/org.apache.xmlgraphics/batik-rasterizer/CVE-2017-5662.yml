identifier: "CVE-2017-5662"
package_slug: "maven/org.apache.xmlgraphics/batik-rasterizer"
title: "XXE vulnerability"
description: "Files lying on the filesystem of the server which uses batik can be
  revealed to arbitrary users who send maliciously formed SVG files. The file types
  that can be shown depend on the user context in which the exploitable application
  is running. If the user is root a full compromise of the server - including confidential
  or sensitive files - would be possible. XXE can also be used to attack the availability
  of the server via denial of service as the references within a xml document can
  trivially trigger an amplification attack."
