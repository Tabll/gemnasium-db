package_slug: "maven/org.apache.xmlgraphics/batik-dom"
title: "Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference"
description: "In Apache Batik before 1.9, files lying on the filesystem of the server
  which uses batik can be revealed to arbitrary users who send maliciously formed
  SVG files. The file types that can be shown depend on the user context in which
  the exploitable application is running. If the user is root a full compromise of
  the server - including confidential or sensitive files - would be possible. XXE
  can also be used to attack the availability of the server via denial of service
  as the references within a xml document can trivially trigger an amplification attack."
