identifier: "CVE-2017-5661"
package_slug: "maven/org.apache.xmlgraphics/fop"
title: "Denial of Service with XXE"
description: "Files lying on the filesystem of the server which uses FOP can be revealed
  to arbitrary users who send maliciously formed SVG files. The file types that can
  be shown depend on the user context in which the exploitable application is running.
  If the user is root a full compromise of the server - including confidential or
  sensitive files - would be possible. XXE can also be used to attack the availability
  of the server via denial of service as the references within a xml document can
  trivially trigger an amplification attack."
