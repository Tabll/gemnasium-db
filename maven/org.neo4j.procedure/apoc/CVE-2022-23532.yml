title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "APOC (Awesome Procedures on Cypher) is an add-on library for Neo4j that
  provides hundreds of procedures and functions. A path traversal vulnerability found
  in the apoc.export.* procedures of apoc plugins in Neo4j Graph database. The issue
  allows a malicious actor to potentially break out of the expected directory. The
  vulnerability is such that files could only be created but not overwritten. For
  the vulnerability to be exploited, an attacker would need access to execute an arbitrary
  query, either by having access to an authenticated Neo4j client, or a Cypher injection
  vulnerability in an application. The minimum versions containing patch for this
  vulnerability are 4.4.0.12 and 4.3.0.12 and 5.3.1. As a workaround, you can control
  the allowlist of the procedures that can be used in your system, and/or turn off
  local file access by setting apoc.export.file.enabled=false."
