title: "Instaclustr Cassandra-Lucene-Index allows bypass of Cassandra RBAC"
description: "**Summary / Details**\nSystems running the Instaclustr fork of Stratio's
  Cassandra-Lucene-Index plugin versions 4.0-rc1-1.0.0 through 4.0.16-1.0.0 and 4.1.0-1.0.0
  through 4.1.8-1.0.0, installed into Apache Cassandra version 4.x, are susceptible
  to a vulnerability which when successfully exploited could allow authenticated Cassandra
  users to remotely bypass RBAC to access data and and escalate their privileges.\n\n**Affected
  Versions**\n-\tCassandra-Lucene-Index plugin versions 4.0-rc1-1.0.0 through 4.0.16-1.0.0\n-\tversions
  4.1.0-1.0.0 through 4.1.8-1.0.0\nwhen installed into Apache Cassandra version 4.x.\n\n**Required
  Configuration for Exploit**\nThese are the conditions required to enable exploit:\n1.
  Cassandra 4.x\n2. Vulnerable version of the Cassandra-Lucene-Index plugin configured
  for use\n3. Data added to tables\n4. Lucene index created\n5. Cassandra flush has
  run\n\n**Mitigation/Prevention**\nMitigation requires dropping all Lucene indexes
  and stopping use of the plugin. Exploit will be possible any time the required conditions
  are met.\n\n**Solution**\nUpgrade to a fixed version of the Cassandra-Lucene-Index
  plugin.\nReview users in Cassandra to validate all superuser privileges."
