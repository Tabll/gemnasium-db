title: "Failing DTLS handshakes may cause throttling to block processing of records"
description: "Eclipse Californium is a Java implementation of RFC7252 - Constrained
  Application Protocol for IoT Cloud services. In versions prior to 3.7.0, and 2.7.4,
  Californium is vulnerable to a Denial of Service. Failing handshakes don't cleanup
  counters for throttling, causing the threshold to be reached without being released
  again. This results in permanently dropping records. The issue was reported for
  certificate based handshakes, but may also affect PSK based handshakes. It generally
  affects client and server as well. This issue is patched in version 3.7.0 and 2.7.4.
  There are no known workarounds. main: commit 726bac57659410da463dcf404b3e79a7312ac0b9
  2.7.x: commit 5648a0c27c2c2667c98419254557a14bac2b1f3f"
