package_slug: "maven/org.apache.accumulo/accumulo-master"
title: "Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource"
description: "Apache Accumulo versions 1.5.0 through 1.10.0 and version 2.0.0 do not
  properly check the return value of some policy enforcement functions before permitting
  an authenticated user to perform certain administrative operations. Specifically,
  the return values of the 'canFlush' and 'canPerformSystemActions' security functions
  are not checked in some instances, therefore allowing an authenticated user with
  insufficient permissions to perform the following actions: flushing a table, shutting
  down Accumulo or an individual tablet server, and setting or removing system-wide
  Accumulo configuration properties."
