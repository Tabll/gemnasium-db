identifier: "CVE-2020-17533"
package_slug: "maven/org.apache.accumulo/accumulo"
title: "Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource"
description: "Apache Accumulo does not properly check the return value of some policy
  enforcement functions before permitting an authenticated user to perform certain
  administrative operations. Specifically, the return values of the `canFlush` and
  `canPerformSystemActions` security functions are not checked in some instances,
  therefore allowing an authenticated user with insufficient permissions to perform
  the following actions: flushing a table, shutting down Accumulo or an individual
  tablet server, and setting or removing system-wide Accumulo configuration properties."
