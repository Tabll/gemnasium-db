title: "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
description: "The OpenID Connect server implementation for MITREid Connect through
  1.3.3 contains a Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability. The vulnerability
  arises due to unsafe usage of the logo_uri parameter in the Dynamic Client Registration
  request. An unauthenticated attacker can make a HTTP request from the vulnerable
  server to any address in the internal network and obtain its response (which might,
  for example, have a JavaScript payload for resultant XSS). The issue can be exploited
  to bypass network boundaries, obtain sensitive data, or attack other hosts in the
  internal network."
