identifier: "CVE-2021-26715"
package_slug: "maven/org.mitre/openid-connect-parent"
title: "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
description: "The OpenID Connect server implementation for MITREid Connect contains
  a Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability. The vulnerability arises due
  to unsafe usage of the logo_uri parameter in the Dynamic Client Registration request.
  An unauthenticated attacker can make a HTTP request from the vulnerable server to
  any address in the internal network and obtain its response (which might, for example,
  have a JavaScript payload for resultant XSS). The issue can be exploited to bypass
  network boundaries, obtain sensitive data, or attack other hosts in the internal
  network."
