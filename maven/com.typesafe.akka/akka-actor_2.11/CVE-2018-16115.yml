title: "Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)"
description: "Lightbend Akka 2.5.x before 2.5.16 allows message disclosure and modification
  because of an RNG error. A random number generator is used in Akka Remoting for
  TLS (both classic and Artery Remoting). Akka allows configuration of custom random
  number generators. For historical reasons, Akka included the AES128CounterSecureRNG
  and AES256CounterSecureRNG random number generators. The implementations had a bug
  that caused the generated numbers to be repeated after only a few bytes. The custom
  RNG implementations were not configured by default but examples in the documentation
  showed (and therefore implicitly recommended) using the custom ones. This can be
  used by an attacker to compromise the communication if these random number generators
  are enabled in configuration. It would be possible to eavesdrop, replay, or modify
  the messages sent with Akka Remoting/Cluster."
