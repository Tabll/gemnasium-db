package_slug: "maven/org.apache.bcel/bcel"
title: "Out-of-bounds Write"
description: "Apache Commons BCEL has a number of APIs that would normally only allow
  changing specific class characteristics. However, due to an out-of-bounds writing
  issue, these APIs can be used to produce arbitrary bytecode. This could be abused
  in applications that pass attacker-controllable data to those APIs, giving the attacker
  more control over the resulting bytecode than otherwise expected. Update to Apache
  Commons BCEL 6.6.0."
