  is a risk of remote command execution. \n\nSeveral components of RocketMQ, including
  NameServer, Broker, and Controller, are leaked on the extranet and lack permission
  verification, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability by using the update configuration
  function to execute commands as the system users that RocketMQ is running as. Additionally,

  prevent these attacks, users are recommended to upgrade to version 5.1.1 or above for
  using RocketMQ 5.x or 4.9.6 or above for using RocketMQ 4.x .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
