  is a risk of remote command execution.\n\nSeveral components of RocketMQ, including
  NameServer, Broker, and Controller, are leaked on the extranet and lack permission
  verification, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability by using the update configuration
  function to execute commands as the system users that RocketMQ is running as. Additionally,
