title: "Apache RocketMQ Vulnerable to Unauthorized Exposure of Sensitive Data"
description: "For RocketMQ versions 5.2.0 and below, under certain conditions, there
  is a risk of exposure of sensitive Information to an unauthorized actor even if
  RocketMQ is enabled with authentication and authorization functions.\n\nAn attacker,
  possessing regular user privileges or listed in the IP allowlist, could potentially
  acquire the administrator's account and password through specific interfaces. Such
  an action would grant them full control over RocketMQ, provided they have access
  to the broker IP address list.\n\nTo mitigate these security threats, it is strongly
  advised that users upgrade to version 5.3.0 or newer. Additionally, we recommend
  users to use RocketMQ ACL 2.0 instead of the original RocketMQ ACL when upgrading
  to version Apache RocketMQ 5.3.0."
