title: "Genie Path Traversal vulnerability via File Uploads"
description: "Genie's API accepts a multipart/form-data file upload which can be saved
  to a location on disk. However, it takes a user-supplied filename as part of the
  request and uses this as the filename when writing the file to disk. Since this
  filename is user-controlled, it is possible for a malicious actor to manipulate
  the filename in order to break out of the default attachment storage path and perform
  path traversal.\n\nUsing this technique it is possible to write a file with any
  user specified name and file contents to any location on the file system that the
  Java process has write access to."
