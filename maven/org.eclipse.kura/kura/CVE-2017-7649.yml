identifier: "CVE-2017-7649"
package_slug: "maven/org.eclipse.kura/kura"
title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "Kura takes control over the device's firewall setup but does not allow
  IPv6 firewall rules to be configured. The Equinox console port is left open, logs
  into Kura without any user credentials over unencrypted telnet and executes commands
  using the Equinox `exec` command. As the process is running as `root` full control
  over the device can be acquired. IPv6 is also left in auto-configuration mode, accepting
  router advertisements automatically and assigns a MAC address based IPv6 address."
