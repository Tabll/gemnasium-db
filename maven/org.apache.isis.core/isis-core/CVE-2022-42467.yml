package_slug: "maven/org.apache.isis.core/isis-core"
title: "Insecure Default Initialization of Resource"
description: "When running in prototype mode, the h2 webconsole module (accessible
  from the Prototype menu) is automatically made available with the ability to directly
  query the database. It was felt that it is safer to require the developer to explicitly
  enable this capability. As of 2.0.0-M8, this can now be done using the `isis.prototyping.h2-console.web-allow-remote-access`
  configuration property; the web console will be unavailable without setting this
  configuration. As an additional safeguard, the new `isis.prototyping.h2-console.generate-random-web-admin-password`
  configuration parameter (enabled by default) requires that the administrator use
  a randomly generated password to use the console. The password is printed to the
  log, as \"webAdminPass: xxx\" (where \"xxx\") is the password. To revert to the
  original behaviour, the administrator would therefore need to set these configuration
  parameter: `isis.prototyping.h2-console.web-allow-remote-access=true isis.prototyping.h2-console.generate-random-web-admin-password=false`
  Note also that the h2 webconsole is never available in production mode, so these
  safeguards are only to ensure that the webconsole is secured by default also in
  prototype mode."
