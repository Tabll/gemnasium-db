title: "Apache Ignite: Possible RCE when deserializing incoming messages by the server
  node"
description: "In Apache Ignite versions from 2.6.0 and before 2.17.0, configured Class
  Serialization Filters are ignored for some Ignite endpoints. The vulnerability could
  be exploited if an attacker manually crafts an Ignite message containing a vulnerable
  object whose class is present in the Ignite server classpath and sends it to Ignite
  server endpoints. Deserialization of such a message by the Ignite server may result
  in the execution of arbitrary code on the Apache Ignite server side."
