title: "Strimzi allows unrestricted access to all Secrets in the same Kubernetes namespace
  from Kafka Connect and MirrorMaker 2 operands"
description: "In some situations, Strimzi creates an incorrect Kubernetes `Role` which
  grants the Apache Kafka Connect and Apache Kafka MirrorMaker 2 operands the `GET`
  access to all Kubernetes Secrets that exist in the given Kubernetes namespace. The
  exact scenario when this happens is when:\n* Apache Kafka Connect is deployed without
  at least one of the following options configured:\n* TLS encryption with configured
  trusted certificates (no `.spec.tls.trustedCertificates` section in the `KafkaConnect`
  CR)\n* mTLS authentication (no `type: tls` in `.spec.authentication` section of
  the `KafkaConnect` CR)\n* TLS encryption with configured trusted certificates for
  `type: oauth` authentication (no `.spec.authentication.tlsTrustedCertificates` section
  in the `KafkaConnect` CR)\n* Apache Kafka MirrorMaker2 is deployed without at least
  one of the following options configured for the target cluster:\n* TLS encryption
  with configured trusted certificates (no `.spec.target.tls.trustedCertificates`
  section in the `KafkaConnect` CR)\n* mTLS authentication (no `type: tls` in `.spec.target.authentication`
  section of the `KafkaConnect` CR)\n* TLS encryption with configured trusted certificates
  for `type: oauth` authentication (no `.spec.target.authentication.tlsTrustedCertificates`
  section in the `KafkaConnect` CR)\n* TLS encryption with configured trusted certificates
  (no `.spec.clusters[].tls.trustedCertificates` section in the `KafkaConnect` CR
  for the target cluster)\n* mTLS authentication (no `type: tls` in `.spec.clusters[].authentication`
  section of the `KafkaConnect` CR for the target cluster)\n* TLS encryption with
  configured trusted certificates for `type: oauth` authentication (no `.spec.clusters[].authentication.tlsTrustedCertificates`
  section in the `KafkaConnect` CR for the target cluster)\n\nWhen the operands configured
  as described above are deployed with Strimzi >= 0.47.0 and <= 0.49.0, any code running
  within their Pods and using their Service Account for authentication will be able
  to `GET` any Kubernetes Secret from the same namespace. This can be done by executing
  3rd party tools from the Pods. Or directly from the Kafka Connect code, for example,
  using configuration providers or HTTP connectors. The Pods are allowed to only `GET`
  the Secrets. They are not allowed to list, watch, modify, or delete the Secrets."
