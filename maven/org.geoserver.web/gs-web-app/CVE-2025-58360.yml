title: "GeoServer is vulnerable to Unauthenticated XML External Entities (XXE) attack
  via WMS GetMap feature"
description: "An XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability was identified. The application
  accepts XML input through a specific endpoint ``/geoserver/wms`` operation ``GetMap``.
  However, this input is not sufficiently sanitized or restricted, allowing an attacker
  to define external entities within the XML request.\n\nAn XML External Entity attack
  is a type of attack that occurs when XML input containing a reference to an external
  entity is processed by a weakly configured XML parser. This attack may lead to the
  disclosure of confidential data, denial of service, port scanning from the perspective
  of the machine where the parser is located, and other system impacts.\n\nBy exploiting
  this vulnerability, an attacker can:\n- Read arbitrary files from the server's file
  system.\n- Conduct Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) to interact with internal
  systems.\n- Execute Denial of Service (DoS) attacks by exhausting resources."
