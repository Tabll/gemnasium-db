title: "Classpath resource disclosure in GWC Web Resource API on Windows / Tomcat"
description: "If GeoServer is deployed in the Windows operating system using an Apache
  Tomcat web application server, it is possible to bypass existing input validation
  in the GeoWebCache ByteStreamController class and read arbitrary classpath resources
  with specific file name extensions.\n\nIf GeoServer is also deployed as a web archive
  using the data directory embedded in the geoserver.war file (rather than an external
  data directory), it will likely be possible to read specific resources to gain administrator
  privileges.  However, it is very unlikely that production environments will be using
  the embedded data directory since, depending on how GeoServer is deployed, it will
  be erased and re-installed (which would also reset to the default password) either
  every time the server restarts or every time a new GeoServer WAR is installed and
  is therefore difficult to maintain. An external data directory will always be used
  if GeoServer is running in standalone mode (via an installer or a binary)."
