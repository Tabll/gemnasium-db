identifier: "CVE-2017-15708"
package_slug: "maven/org.apache.synapse/synapse"
title: "Injection Vulnerability"
description: "In Apache Synapse, no authentication is required by default for Java
  Remote Method Invocation (RMI), resulting in Apache Synapse allowing remote code
  execution attacks that can be performed by injecting specially crafted serialized
  objects. The presence of Apache Commons Collections (commons-collections-3.2.1.jar)
  or previous versions in Synapse distribution makes this exploitable. To mitigate
  the issue, RMI access must be restricted to trusted users only."
