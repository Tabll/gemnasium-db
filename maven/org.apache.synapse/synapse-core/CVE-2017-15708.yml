package_slug: "maven/org.apache.synapse/synapse-core"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream
  Component ('Injection')"
description: "In Apache Synapse, by default no authentication is required for Java
  Remote Method Invocation (RMI). So Apache Synapse 3.0.1 or all previous releases
  (3.0.0, 2.1.0, 2.0.0, 1.2, 1.1.2, 1.1.1) allows remote code execution attacks that
  can be performed by injecting specially crafted serialized objects. And the presence
  of Apache Commons Collections 3.2.1 (commons-collections-3.2.1.jar) or previous
  versions in Synapse distribution makes this exploitable. To mitigate the issue,
  we need to limit RMI access to trusted users only. Further upgrading to 3.0.1 version
  will eliminate the risk of having said Commons Collection version. In Synapse 3.0.1,
  Commons Collection has been updated to 3.2.2 version."
