title: "Butterfly has path/URL confusion in resource handling leading to multiple
  weaknesses"
description: "The Butterfly framework uses the `java.net.URL` class to refer to (what
  are expected to be) local resource files, like images or templates. This works:
  \"opening a connection\" to these URLs opens the local file. However, if a `file:/`
  URL is directly given where a relative path (resource name) is expected, this is
  also accepted in some code paths; the app then fetches the file, from a remote machine
  if indicated, and uses it as if it was a trusted part of the app's codebase.\n\nThis
  leads to multiple weaknesses and potential weaknesses:\n\n* An attacker that has
  network access to the application could use it to gain access to files, either on
  the the server's filesystem (path traversal) or shared by nearby machines (server-side
  request forgery with e.g. SMB).\n* An attacker that can lead or redirect a user
  to a crafted URL belonging to the app could cause arbitrary attacker-controlled
  JavaScript to be loaded in the victim's browser (cross-site scripting).\n* If an
  app is written in such a way that an attacker can influence the resource name used
  for a template, that attacker could cause the app to fetch and execute an attacker-controlled
  template (remote code execution)."
