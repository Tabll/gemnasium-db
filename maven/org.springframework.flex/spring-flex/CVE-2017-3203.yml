title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "The Java implementations of AMF3 deserializers in Pivotal/Spring Spring-flex
  derive class instances from `java.io.Externalizable` rather than the AMF3 specification's
  recommendation of `flash.utils.IExternalizable`. A remote attacker with the ability
  to spoof or control an RMI server connection may be able to send serialized Java
  objects that execute arbitrary code when deserialized."
