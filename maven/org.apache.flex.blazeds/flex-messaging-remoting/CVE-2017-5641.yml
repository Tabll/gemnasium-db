package_slug: "maven/org.apache.flex.blazeds/flex-messaging-remoting"
title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "Previous versions of Apache Flex BlazeDS (4.7.2 and earlier) does not
  restrict which types were allowed for AMF(X) object deserialization by default.
  During the deserialization process code is executed that for several known types
  has undesired side-effects. Other, unknown types may also exhibit such behaviors.
  One vector in the Java standard library exists that allows an attacker to trigger
  possibly further exploitable Java deserialization of untrusted data. Other known
  vectors in third party libraries can be used to trigger remote code execution."
