title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "In Apache Commons IO before 2.7, When invoking the method FileNameUtils.normalize
  with an improper input string, like \"//../foo\", or \"\\\\..\\foo\", the result
  would be the same value, thus possibly providing access to files in the parent directory,
  but not further above (thus \"limited\" path traversal), if the calling code would
  use the result to construct a path value."
