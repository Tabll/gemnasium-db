title: "Nimbus JOSE + JWT is vulnerable to DoS attacks when processing deeply nested
  JSON"
description: "Connect2id Nimbus JOSE + JWT before 10.0.2 allows a remote attacker
  to cause a denial of service via a deeply nested JSON object supplied in a JWT claim
  set, because of uncontrolled recursion. NOTE: this is independent of the Gson 2.11.0
  issue because the Connect2id product could have checked the JSON object nesting
  depth, regardless of what limits (if any) were imposed by Gson."
