title: "Issue with whitespace in JWT roles in OpenSearch"
description: "### Advisory title: Issue with whitespace in JWT roles\n\n### Affected
  versions:\nOpenSearch 1.0.0-1.3.7 and 2.0.0-2.4.1\n\n### Patched versions:\nOpenSearch
  1.3.8 and 2.5.0\n\n### Impact:\nOpenSearch uses JWTs to store role claims obtained
  from the Identity Provider (IdP) when the authentication backend is SAML or OpenID
  Connect. There is an issue in how those claims are processed from the JWTs where
  the leading and trailing whitespace is trimmed, allowing users to potentially claim
  roles they are not assigned to if any role matches the whitespace-stripped version
  of the roles they are a member of.\n\nThis issue is only present for authenticated
  users, and it requires either the existence of roles that match, not considering
  leading/trailing whitespace, or the ability for users to create said matching roles.
  In addition, the Identity Provider must allow leading and trailing spaces in role
  names.\n\n### Patches:\nOpenSearch versions 1.3.8 and 2.5.0 contain a fix for this
  issue.\n\n### For more information:\nIf you have any questions or comments about
  this advisory, please contact AWS/Amazon Security via our issue reporting page (https://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting/)
  or directly via email to [aws-security@amazon.com](mailto:aws-security@amazon.com).
