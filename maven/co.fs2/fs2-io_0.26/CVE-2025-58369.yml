title: "FS2 half-shutdown of socket during TLS handshake may result in spin loop on
  opposite side"
description: "When establishing a TLS session using `fs2-io` on the JVM using the
  `fs2.io.net.tls` package, if one side of the connection shuts down write while the
  peer side is awaiting more data to progress the TLS handshake, the peer side will
  spin loop on the socket read, fully utilizing a CPU. This CPU is consumed until
  the overall connection is closed.\n\nThis could be used as a denial of service attack
  on an fs2-io powered server -- for example, by opening many connections and putting
  them in a half-shutdown state.\n\nNote: this issue impacts ember backed http4s servers
  with HTTPS as a result of ember using fs2's TLS support."
