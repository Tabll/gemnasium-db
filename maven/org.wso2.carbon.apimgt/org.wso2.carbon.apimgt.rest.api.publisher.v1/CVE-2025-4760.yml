title: "WSO2 carbon-apimgt affected by an authenticated stored cross-site scripting
  (XSS) vulnerability"
description: "An authenticated stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists
  in WSO2 API Manager components (`carbon-apimgt`) due to insufficient validation
  of user-supplied input during API document upload in the Publisher portal.\n\nA
  user with publisher privileges can upload a crafted API document whose contents
  are later rendered in the UI for other users, leading to attacker-controlled script
  execution. Likely outcomes include redirection to malicious sites, unauthorized
  UI modifications, or exfiltration of data accessible to the browser; session hijacking
  is mitigated by the use of `HttpOnly` session cookies.\n\nTo remediate, update to
  version 9.31.117 or above."
