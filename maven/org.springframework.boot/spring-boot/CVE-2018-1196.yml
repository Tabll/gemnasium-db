identifier: "CVE-2018-1196"
package_slug: "maven/org.springframework.boot/spring-boot"
title: "Symlink privilege escalation attack via Spring Boot launch script"
description: "Spring Boot supports an embedded launch script that can be used to easily
  run the application as a systemd or init.d linux service. The script included with
  Spring Boot is susceptible to a symlink attack which allows the `run_user` to overwrite
  and take ownership of any file on the same system. In order to instigate the attack,
  the application must be installed as a service and the `run_user` requires shell
  access to the server."
