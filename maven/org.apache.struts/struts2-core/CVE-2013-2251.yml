package_slug: "maven/org.apache.struts/struts2-core"
title: "Code injection in Apache Struts"
description: "The Struts 2 DefaultActionMapper supports a method for short-circuit
  navigation state changes by prefixing parameters with \"action:\" or \"redirect:\",
  followed by a desired navigational target expression. This mechanism was intended
  to help with attaching navigational information to buttons within forms.\n\nIn Struts
  2 before 2.3.15.1 the information following \"action:\", \"redirect:\" or \"redirectAction:\"
  is not properly sanitized. Since said information will be evaluated as OGNL expression
  against the value stack, this introduces the possibility to inject server side code."
