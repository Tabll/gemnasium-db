title: "Apache Struts vulnerable to memory exhaustion"
description: "Denial of service via out of memory (OOM) owing to no sanity limit on
  normal form fields in multipart forms. When a Multipart request has non-file normal
  form fields, Struts used to bring them into memory as Strings without checking their
  sizes. This could lead to an OOM if developer has set struts.multipart.maxSize to
  a value equal or greater than the available memory.\n\nUpgrade to Struts 2.5.31
  or 6.1.2.1 or greater"
