title: "Apache Struts file upload logic is flawed"
description: "File upload logic is flawed vulnerability in Apache Struts. An attacker
  can manipulate file upload params to enable paths traversal and under some circumstances
  this can lead to uploading a malicious file which can be used to perform Remote
  Code Execution.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Struts: from 2.0.0 before 6.4.0.\n\nUsers
  are recommended to upgrade to version 6.4.0 at least and migrate to the new file
  upload mechanism https://struts.apache.org/core-developers/file-upload. If you are
  not using an old file upload logic based on FileuploadInterceptor your application
  is safe.\n\nYou can find more details in  https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/WW/S2-067
