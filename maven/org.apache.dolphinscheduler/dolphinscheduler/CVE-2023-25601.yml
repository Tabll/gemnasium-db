title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "On version 3.0.0 through 3.1.1, Apache DolphinScheduler's python gateway
  suffered from improper authentication: an attacker could use a socket bytes attack
  without authentication. This issue has been fixed from version 3.1.2 onwards. For
  users who use version 3.0.0 to 3.1.1, you can turn off the python-gateway function
  by changing the value `python-gateway.enabled=false` in configuration file `application.yaml`.
  If you are using the python gateway, please upgrade to version 3.1.2 or above.\n"
