package_slug: "maven/org.zenframework.z8.dependencies.commons/log4j-1.2.17"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')"
description: "By design, the JDBCAppender in Log4j 1.2.x accepts an SQL statement
  as a configuration parameter where the values to be inserted are converters from
  PatternLayout. The message converter, %m, is likely to always be included. This
  allows attackers to manipulate the SQL by entering crafted strings into input fields
  or headers of an application that are logged allowing unintended SQL queries to
  be executed. Note this issue only affects Log4j 1.x when specifically configured
  to use the JDBCAppender, which is not the default. Beginning in version 2.0-beta8,
  the JDBCAppender was re-introduced with proper support for parameterized SQL queries
  and further customization over the columns written to in logs. Apache Log4j 1.2
  reached end of life in August 2015. Users should upgrade to Log4j 2 as it addresses
  numerous other issues from the previous versions."
