title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "JMSAppender in Log4j 1.2 is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted
  data when the attacker has write access to the Log4j configuration. The attacker
  can provide TopicBindingName and TopicConnectionFactoryBindingName configurations
  causing JMSAppender to perform JNDI requests that result in remote code execution
  in a similar fashion to CVE-2021-44228. Note this issue only affects Log4j 1.2 when
  specifically configured to use JMSAppender, which is not the default. Apache Log4j
  1.2 reached end of life in August 2015. Users should upgrade to Log4j 2 as it addresses
  numerous other issues from the previous versions."
