title: "Vulnerable dependency in XTDB connector"
description: "### Impact\n\nThe impacted portion of the XTDB connector is its connectivity
  to S3 as a backing store: this is the only portion of the connector that uses this
  vulnerable `httpclient` dependency. Per the description, the vulnerability regards
  URIs that may be misinterpreted, which given the area of impact within the connector
  we understand to be any URI used to configure connectivity to S3. Note therefore
  that if you do not use or configure S3 as a backing store in your use of the connector,
  you should not be exposed to any vulnerability from this component.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe
  problem has been addressed in version 4.5.13 of the httpclient library, which is
  included as a replacement dependency version for the build of the XTDB connector
  from release 3.5 onwards. Therefore, using release 3.5 (or newer) of the connector
  will include the fixes to address this CVE.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nWe have not investigated
  specific workarounds, but per the description of the issue it seems likely that
  ensuring the proper URIs are used for any S3 connectivity used by the connector
  (and ensuring there are appropriate controls around modifying such URIs in the connector's
  configuration) would be the first point of investigation.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13956"
