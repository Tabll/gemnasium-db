title: "LocalS3 Project Bucket Operations Vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE)
  Injection"
description: "The LocalS3 project contains an XML External Entity (XXE) Injection
  vulnerability in its bucket operations that process XML data. Specifically, the
  vulnerability exists in the bucket ACL and bucket tagging operations. The application
  processes XML input without properly disabling external entity resolution, allowing
  an attacker to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.\n\nThe vulnerability
  occurs because the XML parser used by the application processes DOCTYPE declarations
  and allows external entity references. When processing bucket ACL or tagging operations,
  the application includes the content of external entities in its response, effectively
  exposing sensitive files from the server.\n\nThis type of vulnerability can be exploited
  to read sensitive files, perform server-side request forgery (SSRF), or potentially
  achieve denial of service through various XXE attack vectors."
