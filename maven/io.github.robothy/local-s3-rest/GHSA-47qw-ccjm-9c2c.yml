title: "LocalS3 XML Parser Vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) Injection"
description: "The LocalS3 project, which implements an S3-compatible storage interface,
  contains a critical XML External Entity (XXE) Injection vulnerability in its XML
  parsing functionality. When processing XML requests for multipart upload operations,
  the application accepts and processes XML external entities, allowing an attacker
  to read local system files and potentially make outbound network connections.\n\nThe
  vulnerability exists because the XML parser is configured to process external entities
  and DTD (Document Type Definition) declarations without proper restrictions. This
  allows an attacker to define external entities that can read local files and exfiltrate
  their contents through outbound HTTP requests.\n\nThe vulnerability is particularly
  severe as it allows direct access to sensitive files on the filesystem, bypassing
  any directory traversal protections that might be in place for normal S3 operations."
