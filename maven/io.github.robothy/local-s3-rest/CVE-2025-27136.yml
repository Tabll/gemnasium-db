title: "LocalS3 CreateBucketConfiguration Endpoint XML External Entity (XXE) Injection"
description: "The LocalS3 service's bucket creation endpoint is vulnerable to XML
  External Entity (XXE) injection. When processing the CreateBucketConfiguration XML
  document during bucket creation, the service's XML parser is configured to resolve
  external entities. This allows an attacker to declare an external entity that references
  an internal URL, which the server will then attempt to fetch when parsing the XML.\n\nThe
  vulnerability specifically occurs in the location constraint processing, where the
  XML parser resolves external entities without proper validation or restrictions.
  When the external entity is resolved, the server makes an HTTP request to the specified
  URL and includes the response content in the parsed XML document.\n\nThis vulnerability
  can be exploited to perform server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks, allowing
  an attacker to make requests to internal services or resources that should not be
  accessible from external networks. The server will include the responses from these
  internal requests in the resulting bucket configuration, effectively leaking sensitive
  information."
