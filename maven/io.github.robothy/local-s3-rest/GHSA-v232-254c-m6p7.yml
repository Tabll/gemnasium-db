title: "LocalS3 Project Vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) Injection via Bucket
  Tagging API"
description: "The LocalS3 project, an S3-compatible storage service, is vulnerable
  to XML External Entity (XXE) injection through its bucket tagging API. The vulnerability
  exists because the application processes XML input without properly disabling external
  entity resolution.\n\nWhen processing XML data for bucket tagging operations, the
  application allows the definition and resolution of external entities. This vulnerability
  allows an attacker to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem by defining
  an external entity that references local files.\n\nThe vulnerability is particularly
  severe because it allows direct access to sensitive files on the server's filesystem,
  bypassing any intended access controls. The XXE vulnerability can be exploited to
  read any file that the application process has access to, potentially exposing sensitive
  configuration files, credentials, or other confidential information."
