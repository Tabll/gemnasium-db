title: "Apache IoTDB: Deserialization of untrusted Data"
description: "Apache IoTDB deserializes data from external inputs without sufficient
  validation, allowing attacker-controlled serialized objects to be processed. In
  environments where a compatible gadget chain is reachable, this can be abused to
  execute arbitrary code or alter server state; at minimum it enables high-impact
  integrity and confidentiality compromise on the IoTDB process."
