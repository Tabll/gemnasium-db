package_slug: "maven/org.openhab.ui.bundles/org.openhab.ui.cometvisu"
title: "CometVisu Backend for openHAB affected by RCE through path traversal"
description: "CometVisu's file system endpoints don't require authentication and additionally
  the endpoint to update an existing file is susceptible to path traversal. This makes
  it possible for an attacker to overwrite existing files on the openHAB instance.
  If the overwritten file is a shell script that is executed at a later time this
  vulnerability can allow remote code execution by an attacker.\n\nThis vulnerability
  was discovered with the help of CodeQL's [Uncontrolled data used in path expression](https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/java/java-path-injection/)
  query."
