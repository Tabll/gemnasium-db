  occur via the local system temporary directory if temporary storing uploads on the disk is enabled.
  
  This only impacts applications running on Java version 6 and lower. Additionally, this vulnerability
  impacts code running on Unix-like systems, and very old versions of Mac OSX and Windows as they all
