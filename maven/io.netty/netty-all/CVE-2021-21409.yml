identifier: "CVE-2021-21409"
package_slug: "maven/io.netty/netty-all"
title: "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests (HTTP Request Smuggling)"
description: "Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application
  framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers
  & clients. In Netty (io.netty:netty-codec-http2) Final there is a vulnerability
  that enables request smuggling. The content-length header is not correctly validated
  if the request only uses a single Http2HeaderFrame with the endStream set to to
  true. This could lead to request smuggling if the request is proxied to a remote
  peer and translated to HTTP/1.1. This is a followup of GHSA-wm47-8v5p-wjpj/CVE-2021-21295
  which did miss to fix this one case."
