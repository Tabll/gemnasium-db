title: "Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling"
description: "Netty is an asynchronous event-driven network application framework
  for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients.
  The `SniHandler` can allocate up to 16MB of heap for each channel during the TLS
  handshake. When the handler or the channel does not have an idle timeout, it can
  be used to make a TCP server using the `SniHandler` to allocate 16MB of heap. The
  `SniHandler` class is a handler that waits for the TLS handshake to configure a
  `SslHandler` according to the indicated server name by the `ClientHello` record.
  For this matter it allocates a `ByteBuf` using the value defined in the `ClientHello`
  record. Normally the value of the packet should be smaller than the handshake packet
  but there are not checks done here and the way the code is written, it is possible
  to craft a packet that makes the `SslClientHelloHandler`. This vulnerability has
  been fixed in version 4.1.94.Final."
