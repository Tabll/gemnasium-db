title: "io.netty:netty-codec-http2 vulnerable to HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Attack"
description: "A client might overload the server by issue frequent RST frames. This
  can cause a massive amount of load on the remote system and so cause a DDOS attack.
  \n\n### Impact\nThis is a DDOS attack, any http2 server is affected and so you should
  update as soon as possible.\n\n### Patches\nThis is patched in version 4.1.100.Final.\n\n###
  Workarounds\nA user can limit the amount of RST frames that are accepted per connection
  over a timeframe manually using either an own `Http2FrameListener` implementation
  or an `ChannelInboundHandler` implementation (depending which http2 API is used).\n\n###
