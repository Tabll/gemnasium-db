package_slug: "maven/io.netty/netty-codec-http"
title: "Interpretation Conflict"
description: "Netty project is an event-driven asynchronous network application framework.
  In versions prior to 4.1.86.Final, when calling `DefaultHttpHeadesr.set` with an
  _iterator_ of values, header value validation was not performed, allowing malicious
  header values in the iterator to perform HTTP Response Splitting. This issue has
  been patched in version 4.1.86.Final. Integrators can work around the issue by changing
  the `DefaultHttpHeaders.set(CharSequence, Iterator<?>)` call, into a `remove()`
  call, and call `add()` in a loop over the iterator of values."
