title: "Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions"
description: "Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application
  framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers.
  There is a vulnerability on Unix-like systems involving an insecure temp file. When
  netty's multipart decoders are used local information disclosure can occur via the
  local system temporary directory if temporary storing uploads on the disk is enabled.
  On unix-like systems, the temporary directory is shared between all user. As such,
  writing to this directory using APIs that do not explicitly set the `file/directory`
  permissions can lead to information disclosure. Of note, this does not impact modern
  MacOS Operating Systems. The method `File.createTempFile` on unix-like systems creates
  a random file, but, by default will create this file with the permissions `-rw-r--r--`.
  Thus, if sensitive information is written to this file, other local users can read
  this information."
