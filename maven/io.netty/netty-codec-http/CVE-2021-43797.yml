package_slug: "maven/io.netty/netty-codec-http"
title: "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request Smuggling')"
description: "Netty is an asynchronous event-driven network application framework
  for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients.
  Netty skips control chars when they are present at the beginning / end of the header
  name. It should instead fail fast as these are not allowed by the spec and could
  lead to HTTP request smuggling. Failing to do the validation might cause netty to
  `sanitize` header names before it forward these to another remote system when used
  as proxy. This remote system can't see the invalid usage anymore, and therefore
  does not do the validation itself."
