package_slug: "maven/io.netty/netty-codec"
title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "The Snappy frame decoder function does not restrict the chunk length
  which may lead to excessive memory usage. Beside this it also may buffer reserved
  skippable chunks until the whole chunk was received which may lead to excessive
  memory usage as well. This vulnerability can be triggered by supplying malicious
  input that decompresses to a very big size (via a network stream or a file) or by
  sending a huge skippable chunk."
