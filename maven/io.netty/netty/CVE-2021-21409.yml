title: "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests (HTTP Request Smuggling)"
description: "Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application
  framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers
  & clients. In Netty (io.netty:netty-codec-http2) Final there is a vulnerability
  that enables request smuggling. The content-length header is not correctly validated

  true. This could lead to request smuggling if the request is proxied to a remote
  peer and translated to HTTP/1.1."
