package_slug: "maven/io.netty/netty"
title: "Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere"
description: "Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application
  framework. The package `io.netty:netty-codec-http` prior to version 4.1.77.Final
  contains an insufficient fix for CVE-2021-21290. When Netty's multipart decoders
  are used local information disclosure can occur via the local system temporary directory
  if temporary storing uploads on the disk is enabled. This only impacts applications
  running on Java version 6 and lower. Additionally, this vulnerability impacts code
  running on Unix-like systems, and very old versions of Mac OSX and Windows as they
  all share the system temporary directory between all users. Version 4.1.77.Final
  contains a patch for this vulnerability. As a workaround, specify one's own `java.io.tmpdir`
  when starting the JVM or use DefaultHttpDataFactory.setBaseDir(...) to set the directory
  to something that is only readable by the current user."
