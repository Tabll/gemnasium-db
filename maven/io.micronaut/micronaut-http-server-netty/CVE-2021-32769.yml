title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "Micronaut is a JVM-based, full stack Java framework designed for building
  JVM applications. A path traversal vulnerability exists in versions prior to 2.5.9.
  With a basic configuration, it is possible to access any file from a filesystem,
  using \"/../../\" in the URL. This occurs because Micronaut does not restrict file
  access to configured paths. The vulnerability is patched in version 2.5.9. As a
  workaround, do not use `**` in mapping, use only `*`, which exposes only flat structure
  of a directory not allowing traversal. If using Linux, another workaround is to
  run micronaut in chroot."
