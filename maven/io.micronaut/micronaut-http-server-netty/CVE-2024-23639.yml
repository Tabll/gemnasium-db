package_slug: "maven/io.micronaut/micronaut-http-server-netty"
title: "Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime"
description: "Micronaut Framework is a modern, JVM-based, full stack Java framework
  designed for building modular, easily testable JVM applications with support for
  Java, Kotlin and the Groovy language. Enabled but unsecured management endpoints
  are susceptible to drive-by localhost attacks. While not typical of a production
  application, these attacks may have more impact on a development environment where
  such endpoints may be flipped on without much thought. A malicious/compromised website
  can make HTTP requests to `localhost`. Normally, such requests would trigger a CORS
  preflight check which would prevent the request; however, some requests are \"simple\"
  and do not require a preflight check. These endpoints, if enabled and not secured,
  is vulnerable to being triggered. Production environments typically disable unused
  endpoints and secure/restrict access to needed endpoints. A more likely victim is
  the developer in their local development host, who has enabled endpoints without
  security for the sake of easing development. This issue has been addressed in version
  3.8.3. Users are advised to upgrade."
