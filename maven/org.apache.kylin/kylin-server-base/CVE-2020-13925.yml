title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command
  Injection')"
description: "Similar to CVE-2020-1956, Kylin has one more restful API which concatenates
  the API inputs into OS commands and then executes them on the server; while the
  reported API misses necessary input validation, which causes the hackers to have
  the possibility to execute OS command remotely. Users of all previous versions after
  2.3 should upgrade to 3.1.0."
