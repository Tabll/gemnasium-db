- "CVE-2023-29055"
package_slug: "maven/org.apache.kylin/kylin"
title: "Insufficiently Protected Credentials"
description: "In Apache Kylin version 2.0.0 to 4.0.3, there is a Server Config web
  interface that displays the content of file 'kylin.properties', that may contain
  serverside credentials. When the kylin service runs over HTTP (or other plain text
  protocol), it is possible for network sniffers to hijack the HTTP payload and get
  access to the content of kylin.properties and potentially the containing credentials.\n\nTo
  avoid this threat, users are recommended toÂ \n\n * Always turn on HTTPS so that
  network payload is encrypted.\n\n * Avoid putting credentials in kylin.properties,
  or at least not in plain text.\n * Use network firewalls to protect the serverside
  such that it is not accessible to external attackers.\n\n * Upgrade to version Apache
  Kylin 4.0.4, which filters out the sensitive content that goes to the Server Config
  web interface.\n\n"
