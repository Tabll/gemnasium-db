  to help users encrypt their passwords. In the encryption algorithm used by this
  encryption class, the cipher is initialized with a hardcoded key and IV. If users
  use class PasswordPlaceholderConfigurer to encrypt their password and configure
  it into kylin's configuration file, there is a risk that the password may be decrypted.

  Apache Kylin 4 and prior versions."
