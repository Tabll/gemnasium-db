description: "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Apache Kylin. Through
  a kylin server, an attacker may forge a request to invoke \"/kylin/api/xxx/diag\"
  api on another internal host and possibly get leaked information. There are two
  preconditions: 1) The attacker has got admin access to a kylin server; 2) Another
  internal host has the \"/kylin/api/xxx/diag\" api endpoint open for service.\n\nThis
  issue affects Apache Kylin: from 5.0.0 through 5.0.1.\n\nUsers are recommended to
  upgrade to version 5.0.2, which fixes the issue."
