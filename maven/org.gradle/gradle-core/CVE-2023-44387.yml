package_slug: "maven/org.gradle/gradle-core"
title: "Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource"
description: "Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support
  for multi-language development. When copying or archiving symlinked files, Gradle
  resolves them but applies the permissions of the symlink itself instead of the permissions
  of the linked file to the resulting file. This leads to files having too much permissions
  given that symlinks usually are world readable and writeable. While it is unlikely
  this results in a direct vulnerability for the impacted build, it may open up attack
  vectors depending on where build artifacts end up being copied to or un-archived.
  In versions 7.6.3, 8.4 and above, Gradle will now properly use the permissions of
  the file pointed at by the symlink to set permissions of the copied or archived
  file."
