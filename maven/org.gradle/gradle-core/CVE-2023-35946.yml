title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support
  for multi-language development. When Gradle writes a dependency into its dependency
  cache, it uses the dependency's coordinates to compute a file location. With specially
  crafted dependency coordinates, Gradle can be made to write files into an unintended
  location. The file may be written outside the dependency cache or over another file
  in the dependency cache. This vulnerability could be used to poison the dependency
  cache or overwrite important files elsewhere on the filesystem where the Gradle
  process has write permissions. Exploiting this vulnerability requires an attacker
  to have control over a dependency repository used by the Gradle build or have the
  ability to modify the build's configuration. It is unlikely that this would go unnoticed.
  A fix has been released in Gradle 7.6.2 and 8.2 to protect against this vulnerability.
  Gradle will refuse to cache dependencies that have path traversal elements in their
  dependency coordinates. It is recommended that users upgrade to a patched version.
  If you are unable to upgrade to Gradle 7.6.2 or 8.2, `dependency verification` will
  make this vulnerability more difficult to exploit."
