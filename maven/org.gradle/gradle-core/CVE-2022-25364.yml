package_slug: "maven/org.gradle/gradle-core"
title: "Incorrect Authorization"
description: "In Gradle Enterprise before 2021.4.2, the default built-in build cache
  configuration allowed anonymous write access. If this was not manually changed,
  a malicious actor with network access to the build cache could potentially populate
  it with manipulated entries that execute malicious code as part of a build. As of
  2021.4.2, the built-in build cache is inaccessible-by-default, requiring explicit
  configuration of its access-control settings before it can be used. (Remote build
  cache nodes are unaffected as they are inaccessible-by-default.)"
