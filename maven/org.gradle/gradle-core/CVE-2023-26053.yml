title: "Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere"
description: "Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support
  for multi-language development. This is a collision attack on long IDs (64bits)
  for PGP keys. Users of dependency verification in Gradle is vulnerable if they use
  long IDs for PGP keys in a `trusted-key` or `pgp` element in their dependency verification
  metadata file. The fix is to fail dependency verification if anything but a fingerprint
  is used in a trust element in dependency verification metadata. The problem is fixed
  in Gradle 8.0 and above. The problem is also patched in Gradle 6.9.4 and 7.6.1.
  As a workaround, use only full fingerprint IDs for `trusted-key` or `pgp` element
  in the metadata is a protection against this issue."
