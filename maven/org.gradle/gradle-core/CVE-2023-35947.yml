title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support
  for multi-language development. In affected versions when unpacking Tar archives,
  Gradle does not check that files could be written outside of the unpack location.
  This could lead to important files being overwritten anywhere the Gradle process
  has write permissions. For a build reading Tar entries from a Tar archive, this
  issue could allow Gradle to disclose information from sensitive files through an
  arbitrary file read. To exploit this behavior, an attacker needs to either control
  the source of an archive already used by the build or modify the build to interact
  with a malicious archive. It is unlikely that this would go unnoticed. A fix has
  been released in Gradle 7.6.2 and 8.2 to protect against this vulnerability. Starting
  from these versions, Gradle will refuse to handle Tar archives which contain path
  traversal elements in a Tar entry name. Users are advised to upgrade. There are
  no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
