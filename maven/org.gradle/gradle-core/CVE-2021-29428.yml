identifier: "CVE-2021-29428"
package_slug: "maven/org.gradle/gradle-core"
title: "Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions"
description: "In Gradle, on Unix-like systems, the system temporary directory can
  be created with open permissions that allow multiple users to create and delete
  files within it. Gradle builds could be vulnerable to a local privilege escalation
  from an attacker quickly deleting and recreating files in the system temporary directory.
  This vulnerability impacted builds using precompiled script plugins written in Kotlin
  DSL and tests for Gradle plugins written using ProjectBuilder or TestKit. If you
  are on Windows or modern versions of macOS, you are not vulnerable. If you are on
  a Unix-like operating system with the \"sticky\" bit set on your system temporary
  directory, you are not vulnerable. The problem has been patched and released with
  Gradle As a workaround, on Unix-like operating systems, ensure that the \"sticky\"
  bit is set. This only allows the original user (or root) to delete a file. If you
  are unable to change the permissions of the system temporary directory, you can
  move the Java temporary directory by setting the System Property `java.io.tmpdir`.
  The new path needs to limit permissions to the build user only. For additional details
  refer to the referenced GitHub Security Advisory."
