package_slug: "maven/com.clever-cloud/biscuit-java"
title: "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature"
description: "Biscuit is an authentication and authorization token for microservices
  architectures. The Biscuit specification version 1 contains a vulnerable algorithm
  that allows malicious actors to forge valid ?-signatures. Such an attack would allow
  an attacker to create a token with any access level. The version 2 of the specification
  mandates a different algorithm than gamma signatures and as such is not affected
  by this vulnerability. The Biscuit implementations in Rust, Haskell, Go, Java and
  Javascript all have published versions following the v2 specification. There are
  no known workarounds for this issue."
