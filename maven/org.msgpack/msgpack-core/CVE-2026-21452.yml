title: "MessagePack for Java Vulnerable to Remote DoS via Malicious EXT Payload Allocation"
description: "Affected Components:\n```\norg.msgpack.core.MessageUnpacker.readPayload()\norg.msgpack.core.MessageUnpacker.unpackValue()\norg.msgpack.value.ExtensionValue.getData()\n```\nA
  denial-of-service vulnerability exists in MessagePack for Java when deserializing
  .msgpack files containing EXT32 objects with attacker-controlled payload lengths.
  While MessagePack-Java parses extension headers lazily, it later trusts the declared
  EXT payload length when materializing the extension data. When ExtensionValue.getData()
  is invoked, the library attempts to allocate a byte array of the declared length
  without enforcing any upper bound. A malicious .msgpack file of only a few bytes
  can therefore trigger unbounded heap allocation, resulting in JVM heap exhaustion,
  process termination, or service unavailability. This vulnerability is triggered
  during model loading / deserialization, making it a model format vulnerability suitable
  for remote exploitation."
