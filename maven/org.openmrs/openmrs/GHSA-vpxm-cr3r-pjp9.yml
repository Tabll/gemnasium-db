title: "General OpenMRS Security Advisory, January 2025: Penetration Testing Results
  and Patches"
description: "We recently underwent Penetration Testing of OpenMRS by a third-party
  company. **Vulnerabilities were found, and fixes have been made and released.**
  We've released security updates that include critical fixes, and so, we strongly
  recommend upgrading affected modules.\n\n**This notice applies to _all_ OpenMRS
  instances.** The testers used the OpenMRS v3 Reference Application (O3 RefApp);
  however, their findings highlighted modules commonly used in older OpenMRS applications,
  including the O2 RefApp."
