package_slug: "maven/com.zaxxer/nuprocess"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')"
description: "NuProcess is an external process execution implementation for Java.
  In all the versions of NuProcess where it forks processes by using the JVM's Java_java_lang_UNIXProcess_forkAndExec
  method (1.2.0+), attackers can use NUL characters in their strings to perform command
  line injection. Java's ProcessBuilder isn't vulnerable because of a check in ProcessBuilder.start.
  NuProcess is missing that check. This vulnerability can only be exploited to inject
  command line arguments on Linux. Version 2.0.5 contains a patch. As a workaround,
  users of the library can sanitize command strings to remove NUL characters prior
  to passing them to NuProcess for execution."
