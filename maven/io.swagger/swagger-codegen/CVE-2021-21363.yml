package_slug: "maven/io.swagger/swagger-codegen"
title: "Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions"
description: "swagger-codegen is an open-source project which contains a template-driven
  engine to generate documentation, API clients and server stubs in different languages
  by parsing your OpenAPI / Swagger definition. In swagger-codegen before version
  2.4.19, on Unix like systems, the system's temporary directory is shared between
  all users on that system. A collocated user can observe the process of creating
  a temporary sub directory in the shared temporary directory and race to complete
  the creation of the temporary subdirectory. This vulnerability is local privilege
  escalation because the contents of the `outputFolder` can be appended to by an attacker.
  As such, code written to this directory, when executed can be attacker controlled.
  For more details refer to the referenced GitHub Security Advisory. This vulnerability
  is fixed in version 2.4.19. Note this is a distinct vulnerability from CVE-2021-21364."
