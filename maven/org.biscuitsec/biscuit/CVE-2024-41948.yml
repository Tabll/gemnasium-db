title: "biscuit-java vulnerable to public key confusion in third party block"
description: "Third-party blocks can be generated without transferring the whole token
  to the third-party authority. Instead, a `ThirdPartyBlock` request can be sent,
  providing only the necessary info to generate a third-party block and to sign it:\n\nthe
  public key of the previous block (used in the signature)\nthe public keys part of
  the token symbol table (for public key interning in datalog expressions)\nA third-part
  block request forged by a malicious user can trick the third-party authority into
  generating datalog trusting the wrong keypair.\n\nConsider the following example
  (nominal case)\n* Authority A emits the following token: `check if thirdparty(\"b\")
  trusting ${pubkeyB}`\n* The well-behaving holder then generates a third-party block
  request based on the token and sends it to third-party authority B\n* Third-party
  B generates the following third-party block `thirdparty(\"b\"); check if thirdparty(\"c\")
  trusting ${pubkeyC}`\n* The token holder now must obtain a third-party block from
  third party C to be able to use the token\n\nNow, with a malicious user:\n* Authority
  A emits the following token: `check if thirdparty(\"b\") trusting ${pubkeyB}`\n*
  The holder then attenuates the token with the following third party block `thirdparty(\"c\")`,
  signed with a keypair pubkeyD, privkeyD) they generate\n* The holder then generates
  a third-party block request based on this token, but alter the `ThirdPartyBlockRequest`
  publicKeys field and replace pubkeyD with pubkeyC\n* Third-party B generates the
  following third-party block `thirdparty(\"b\"); check if thirdparty(\"c\") trusting
  ${pubkeyC}`\n* Due to the altered symbol table, the actual meaning of the block
  is `thirdparty(\"b\"); check if thirdparty(\"c\") trusting ${pubkeyD}`\n* The attacker
  can now use the token without obtaining a third-party block from C."
