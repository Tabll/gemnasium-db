description: "A flaw was found in the JBoss EAP Management Console, where a stored
  Cross-site scripting vulnerability occurs when an application improperly sanitizes
  user input before storing it in a data store. When this stored data is later included

  context of users who view these pages, leading to potential data theft, session
  hijacking, or other malicious activities."
