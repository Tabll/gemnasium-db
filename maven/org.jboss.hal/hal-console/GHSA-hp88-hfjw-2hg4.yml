title: "Duplicate Advisory: HAL Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability of user input
  when storing it in a data store"
description: "# Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-f7jh-m6wp-jm7f. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n# Original Description\n\nA flaw was found in the JBoss EAP Management
  Console, where a stored Cross-site scripting vulnerability occurs when an application
  improperly sanitizes user input before storing it in a data store. When this stored
  data is later included in web pages without adequate sanitization, malicious scripts
  can execute in the context of users who view these pages, leading to potential data
  theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities."
