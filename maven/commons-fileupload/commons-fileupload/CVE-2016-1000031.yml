identifier: "CVE-2016-1000031"
package_slug: "maven/commons-fileupload/commons-fileupload"
title: "Remote Code Execution"
description: "There exists a Java Object in this package that can be manipulated in
  such a way that when it is deserialized, it can write or copy files to disk in arbitrary
  locations. Furthermore, while the Object can be used alone, this new vector can
  be integrated with ysoserial to upload and execute binaries in a single deserialization
  call. This may or may not work depending on an application's implementation of the
  FileUpload library."
