title: "XXE vulnerability on agents in Jenkins OSF Builder Suite : : XML Linter Plugin"
description: "OSF Builder Suite : : XML Linter 1.0.2 and earlier does not configure
  its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.\n\nThis allows attackers
  able to control XML files that get processed by the 'OSF Builder Suite : : XML Linter'
  build step to have agent processes parse a crafted file that uses external entities
  for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins agent or server-side request forgery.\n\nBecause
  Jenkins agent processes usually execute build tools whose input (source code, build
  scripts, etc.) is controlled externally, this vulnerability only has a real impact
  in very narrow circumstances: when attackers can control XML files, but are unable
  to change build steps, Jenkinsfiles, test code that gets executed on the agents,
  or similar."
