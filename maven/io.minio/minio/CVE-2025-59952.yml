title: "MinIO Java Client XML Tag Value Substitution Vulnerability"
description: "In minio-java versions prior to 8.6.0, XML tag values containing references

  exposure of sensitive information, including credentials, file paths, or system
  configuration details, if such references were present in XML content from untrusted
  sources."
