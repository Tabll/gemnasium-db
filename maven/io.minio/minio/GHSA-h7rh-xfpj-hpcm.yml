title: "MinIO Java Client XML Tag Value Substitution Vulnerability"
description: "In minio-java versions prior to 8.6.0, XML tag values containing references
  to system properties or environment variables were automatically substituted with
  their actual values during processing. This unintended behavior could lead to the
  exposure of sensitive information, including credentials, file paths, or system
  configuration details, if such references were present in XML content from untrusted
  sources."
