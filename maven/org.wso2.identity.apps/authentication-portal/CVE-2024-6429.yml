title: "WSO2 Identity Server Apps allows content spoofing in logs"
description: "A content spoofing issue exists in WSO2 Identity Server Apps, specifically
  in the Authentication Portal, due to improper handling of authentication error messages.
  When an authentication failure occurs, the portal previously accepted an `authFailureMsg`
  value supplied via URL and rendered it in the UI without validating it against the
  resource bundle. An attacker can craft a link that causes the portal to display
  attacker-controlled text in the error banner, enabling UI misrepresentation and
  social-engineering.\n\nThe fix validates the message key against the resource bundle
  and encodes input before rendering. Upgrade to `org.wso2.identity.apps:authentication-portal`
  **2.4.4** or later to remediate."
