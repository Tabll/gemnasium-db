title: "H2O vulnerable to Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "The H2O machine learning platform uses \"Iced\" classes as the primary
  means of moving Java Objects around the cluster. The Iced format supports inclusion
  of serialized Java objects. When a model is deserialized, any class is allowed to
  be deserialized (no class allowlist). An attacker can construct a crafted Iced model
  that uses Java gadgets and leads to arbitrary code execution when imported to the
  H2O platform."
