title: "H2O Deserialization of Untrusted Data Vulnerability"
description: "A vulnerability in the h2oai/h2o-3 REST API versions 3.46.0.4 allows
  unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via deserialization of
  untrusted data. The vulnerability exists in the endpoints POST /99/ImportSQLTable
  and POST /3/SaveToHiveTable, where user-controlled JDBC URLs are passed to DriverManager.getConnection,
  leading to deserialization if a MySQL or PostgreSQL driver is available in the classpath.
  This issue is fixed in version 3.46.0.6."
