title: "H2O Vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) via `/3/ParseSetup` Endpoint"
description: "A vulnerability in the `/3/ParseSetup` endpoint of h2oai/h2o-3 version
  3.46.0.1 allows for a denial of service (DoS) attack. The endpoint applies a user-specified
  regular expression to a user-controllable string. This can be exploited by an attacker
  to cause inefficient regular expression complexity, leading to the exhaustion of
  server resources and making the server unresponsive."
