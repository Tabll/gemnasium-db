- "GHSA-269g-pwp5-87pp"
package_slug: "maven/junit/junit"
title: "Information Exposure"
description: "In JUnit4 the test rule `TemporaryFolder` contains a local information
  disclosure vulnerability. On Unix like systems, the system's temporary directory
  is shared between all users on that system. Because of this, when files and directories
  are written into this directory they are, by default, readable by other users on
  that same system. This vulnerability does not allow other users to overwrite the
  contents of these directories or files. This is purely an information disclosure
  vulnerability. This vulnerability impacts you if the JUnit tests write sensitive
  information, like API keys or passwords, into the temporary folder, and the JUnit
  tests execute in an environment where the OS has other untrusted users."
