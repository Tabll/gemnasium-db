package_slug: "maven/org.matrix.android/matrix-android-sdk2"
title: "Key Exchange without Entity Authentication"
description: "matrix-android-sdk2 is the Matrix SDK for Android. Prior to version
  1.5.1, an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver can construct messages
  that legitimately appear to have come from another person, without any indication
  such as a grey shield. Additionally, a sophisticated attacker cooperating with a
  malicious homeserver could employ this vulnerability to perform a targeted attack
  in order to send fake to-device messages appearing to originate from another user.
  This can allow, for example, to inject the key backup secret during a self-verification,
  to make a targeted device start using a malicious key backup spoofed by the homeserver.
  matrix-android-sdk2 would then additionally sign such a key backup with its device
  key, spilling trust over to other devices trusting the matrix-android-sdk2 device.
  These attacks are possible due to a protocol confusion vulnerability that accepts
  to-device messages encrypted with Megolm instead of Olm. matrix-android-sdk2 version
  1.5.1 has been modified to only accept Olm-encrypted to-device messages and to stop
  signing backups on a successful decryption. Out of caution, several other checks
  have been audited or added. This attack requires coordination between a malicious
  home server and an attacker, so those who trust their home servers do not need a
  workaround."
