package_slug: "maven/org.matrix.android/matrix-android-sdk2"
title: "Key Exchange without Entity Authentication"
description: "matrix-android-sdk2 is the Matrix SDK for Android. Prior to version
  1.5.1, an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver can construct messages
  appearing to have come from another person. Such messages will be marked with a
  grey shield on some platforms, but this may be missing in others. This attack is
  possible due to the key forwarding strategy implemented in the matrix-android-sdk2
  that is too permissive. Starting with version 1.5.1, the default policy for accepting
  key forwards has been made more strict in the matrix-android-sdk2. The matrix-android-sdk2
  will now only accept forwarded keys in response to previously issued requests and
  only from own, verified devices. The SDK now sets a `trusted` flag on the decrypted
  message upon decryption, based on whether the key used to decrypt the message was
  received from a trusted source. Clients need to ensure that messages decrypted with
  a key with `trusted = false` are decorated appropriately (for example, by showing
  a warning for such messages). As a workaroubnd, current users of the SDK can disable
  key forwarding in their forks using `CryptoService#enableKeyGossiping(enable: Boolean)`."
