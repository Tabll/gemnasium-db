title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream
  Component ('Injection')"
description: "Versions of Async HTTP Client prior to 1.13.2 is vulnerable to a form
  of targeted request manipulation called CRLF injection. This vulnerability was the
  result of insufficient validation of HTTP header field values before sending them
  to the network. Users is vulnerable if they pass untrusted data into HTTP header
  field values without prior sanitisation. Common use-cases here might be to place
  usernames from a database into HTTP header fields. This vulnerability allows attackers
  to inject new HTTP header fields, or entirely new requests, into the data stream.
  This can cause requests to be understood very differently by the remote server than
  was intended. In general, this is unlikely to result in data disclosure, but it
  can result in a number of logical errors and other misbehaviours."
