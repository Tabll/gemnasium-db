title: "AsyncHttpClient (AHC) library's `CookieStore` replaces explicitly defined
  `Cookie`s"
description: "When making any HTTP request, the automatically enabled and self-managed
  `CookieStore` (aka cookie jar) will silently replace explicitly defined `Cookie`s
  with any that have the same name from the cookie jar. For services that operate
  with multiple users, this can result in one user's `Cookie` being used for another
  user's requests."
