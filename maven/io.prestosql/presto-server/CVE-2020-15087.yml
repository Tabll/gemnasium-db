package_slug: "maven/io.prestosql/presto-server"
title: "Improper Authorization"
description: "In Presto before version 337, authenticated users can bypass authorization
  checks by directly accessing internal APIs. This impacts Presto server installations
  with secure internal communication configured. This does not affect installations
  that have not configured secure internal communication, as these installations are
  inherently insecure. This only affects Presto server installations. This does NOT
  affect clients such as the CLI or JDBC driver. This vulnerability has been fixed
  in version 337. Additionally, this issue can be mitigated by blocking network access
  to internal APIs on the coordinator and workers."
