title: "Apache Syncope allows malicious administrators to inject Groovy code"
description: "Apache Syncope offers the ability to extend / customize the base behavior
  on every deployment by allowing to provide custom implementations of a few Java
  interfaces; such implementations can be provided either as Java or Groovy classes,
  with the latter being particularly attractive as the machinery is set for runtime
  reload.\nSuch a feature has been available for a while, but recently it was discovered
  that a malicious administrator can inject Groovy code that can be executed remotely
  by a running Apache Syncope Core instance.\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to
  version 3.0.14 / 4.0.2, which fix this issue by forcing the Groovy code to run in
  a sandbox."
