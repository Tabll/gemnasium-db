title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "Scala 2.13.x before 2.13.9 has a Java deserialization chain in its JAR
  file. On its own, it cannot be exploited. There is only a risk in conjunction with
  LazyList object deserialization within an application. In such situations, it allows
  attackers to erase contents of arbitrary files, make network connections, or possibly
  run arbitrary code (specifically, Function0 functions) via a gadget chain."
