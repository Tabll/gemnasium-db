title: "Jenkins Testsigma Test Plan vulnerability exposes API keys via job configuration
  form"
description: "Jenkins Testsigma Test Plan run Plugin stores Testsigma API keys in
  job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.\n\nWhile
  these API keys are stored encrypted on disk, in Testsigma Test Plan run Plugin 1.6
  and earlier, the job configuration form does not mask these API keys, increasing
  the potential for attackers to observe and capture them.\n\nAs of publication of
  this advisory, there is no fix."
