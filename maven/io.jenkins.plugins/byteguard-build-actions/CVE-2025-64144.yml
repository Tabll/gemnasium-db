  config.xml files"
description: "Jenkins ByteGuard Build Actions Plugin 1.0 and earlier stores API tokens
  unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.\n\nThese
  tokens can be viewed by users with Item/Extended Read permission or access to the
  Jenkins controller file system.\n\nAdditionally, the job configuration form does
  not mask these credentials, increasing the potential for attackers to observe and
  capture them.\n\nAs of publication of this advisory, there is no fix."
