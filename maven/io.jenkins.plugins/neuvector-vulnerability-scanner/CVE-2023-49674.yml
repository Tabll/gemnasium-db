title: "Jenkins NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner Plugin missing permission check"
description: "Jenkins NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner Plugin 1.22 and earlier does
  not perform a permission check in a connection test HTTP endpoint. This allows attackers
  with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified hostname and port
  using attacker-specified username and password. Additionally, this HTTP endpoint
  does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
  vulnerability.\n\nNeuVector Vulnerability Scanner Plugin 2.2 requires POST requests
  and Overall/Administer permission for the affected HTTP endpoint."
