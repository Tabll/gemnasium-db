package_slug: "maven/org.apache.karaf.management/org.apache.karaf.management.server"
title: "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
description: "In Karaf, JMX authentication takes place using JAAS and authorization
  takes place using ACL files. By default, only an \"admin\" can actually invoke on
  an MBean. However there is a vulnerability there for someone who is not an admin,
  but has a \"viewer\" role. In the 'etc/jmx.acl.cfg', such as role can call get*.
  It's possible to authenticate as a viewer role + invokes on the MLet getMBeansFromURL
  method, which goes off to a remote server to fetch the desired MBean, which is then
  registered in Karaf. At this point the attack fails as \"viewer\" does not have
  the permission to invoke on the MBean. Still, it could act as a SSRF style attack
  and also it essentially allows a \"viewer\" role to pollute the MBean registry,
  which is a kind of privilege escalation. The vulnerability is low as it's possible
  to add a ACL to limit access. Users should update to Apache Karaf 4.2.9 or newer."
