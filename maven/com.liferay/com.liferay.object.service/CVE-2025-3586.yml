package_slug: "maven/com.liferay/com.liferay.object.service"
title: "Liferay Portal and DXP Instance Admin can execute code using Objects Actions
  and Validations"
description: "In Liferay Portal 7.4.3.27 through 7.4.3.42, and Liferay DXP 2024.Q1.1
  through 2024.Q1.20, 2023.Q4.0 through 2023.Q4.10, 2023.Q3.1 through 2023.Q3.10,
  7.4 update 27 through update 42 (Liferay PaaS, and Liferay Self-Hosted), the Objects
  module does not restrict the use of Groovy scripts in Object actions for Admin Users.
  This allows remote authenticated admin users with the Instance Administrator role
  to execute arbitrary Groovy scripts (i.e., remote code execution) through Object
  actions.\n\nIn contrast, in Liferay DXP (Liferay SaaS), the use of Groovy in Object
  actions is not allowed due to the high security risks it poses.\n\nStarting from
  Liferay DXP 2024.Q2 and later, a new feature has been introduced in Instance Settings
  that allows administrators to configure whether Groovy scripts are allowed in their
  instances."
