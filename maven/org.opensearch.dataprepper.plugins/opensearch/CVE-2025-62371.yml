title: "OpenSearch Data Prepper plugins trust all SSL certificates by default"
description: "The OpenSearch sink and source plugins in Data Prepper are configured
  to trust all SSL certificates by default when no certificate path was provided,
  making connections vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\nPrior to this fix,
  the OpenSearch sink and source plugins would automatically use a trust all SSL strategy
  when connecting to OpenSearch clusters if no certificate path was explicitly configured.
  This behavior bypassed SSL certificate validation, potentially allowing attackers
  to intercept and modify data in transit through man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\nThe
  vulnerability affects connections to OpenSearch when the `cert` parameter is not
  explicitly provided."
