title: "GeoIP processor disables SSL certificate validation when downloading databases"
description: "The GeoIP processor in Data Prepper was configured to trust all SSL
  certificates and disable hostname verification when downloading GeoIP databases
  from HTTP URLs, making downloads vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\nThe
  GeoIP processor included a custom SSL implementation that completely bypassed certificate
  validation when downloading GeoIP databases from external sources. The `initiateSSL()`
  method incorrectly implemented an approach for trusting all certificates. Specifically
  it:\n\n* Accepted all SSL certificates without validation\n* Disabled server certificate
  verification\n* Disabled client certificate verification\n* Disabled hostname verification\n\nThis
  configuration made database downloads vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, potentially
  allowing attackers to serve malicious GeoIP databases that could compromise the
  integrity of geolocation data processing."
