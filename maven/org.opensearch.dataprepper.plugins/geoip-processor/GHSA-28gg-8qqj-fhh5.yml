title: "OpenSearch Data Prepper uses deprecated SSL protocol identifier"
description: "The GeoIP processor and Kafka source and buffer were using the deprecated
  \"SSL\" protocol identifier when creating SSL contexts, potentially allowing the
  use of insecure SSL protocols instead of modern TLS versions.\n\nMultiple Data Prepper
  plugins used `SSLContext.getInstance(\"SSL\")` which could potentially allow the
  use of deprecated SSL protocols (SSLv2, SSLv3) that have known security vulnerabilities.
  While modern Java implementations typically default to secure TLS versions even
  with the \"SSL\" identifier, explicitly using \"TLS\" ensures that only secure TLS
  protocols are negotiated.\n\nThe affected components were:\n\n* GeoIP Processor:
  The `DBSource.initiateSSL()` method used for downloading GeoIP databases from external
  sources\n\n* Kafka Plugin: Both `CustomClientSslEngineFactory` and `InsecureSslEngineFactory`
  classes used for Kafka client connections\n\nThis could potentially allow connections
  to negotiate weaker SSL protocols instead of enforcing modern TLS versions, reducing
  the security of data transmission."
