title: "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
description: "CKEditor Integration UI adds support for editing wiki pages using CKEditor.
  Prior to versions 1.64.3,t he `CKEditor.HTMLConverter` document lacked a protection
  against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), allowing to execute macros with the rights
  of the current user. If a privileged user with programming rights was tricked into
  executing a GET request to this document with certain parameters (e.g., via an image
  with a corresponding URL embedded in a comment or via a redirect), this would allow
  arbitrary remote code execution and the attacker could gain rights, access private
  information or impact the availability of the wiki. The issue has been patched in
  the CKEditor Integration version 1.64.3. This has also been patched in the version
  of the CKEditor integration that is bundled starting with XWiki 14.6 RC1. There
  are no known workarounds for this other than upgrading the CKEditor integration
  to a fixed version."
