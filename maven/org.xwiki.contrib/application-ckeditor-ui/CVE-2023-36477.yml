package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.contrib/application-ckeditor-ui"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
  for applications built on top of it. Any user with edit rights can edit all pages
  in the `CKEditor' space. This makes it possible to perform a variety of harmful
  actions, such as removing technical documents, leading to loss of service and editing
  the javascript configuration of CKEditor, leading to persistent XSS. This issue
  has been patched in XWiki 14.10.6 and XWiki 15.1. This issue has been patched on
  the CKEditor Integration extension 1.64.9 for XWiki version older than 14.6RC1.
  Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may manually address the issue
  by restricting the `edit` and `delete` rights to a trusted user or group (e.g. the
  `XWiki.XWikiAdminGroup` group), implicitly disabling those rights for all other
  users. See commit `9d9d86179` for details.\n\n\n\n"
