title: "JDA (Java Discord API) downloads external URLs when updating message components"
description: "Anyone using untrusted message components may be affected. On versions
  >=6.0.0,<6.1.3 of JDA, the requester will attempt to download external media URLs
  from components if they are used in an update or send request.\n\nIf you are used
  `Message#getComponents` or similar to get a list of components and then send those
  components with `sendMessageComponents` or other methods, you might unintentionally
  download media from an external URL in the resolved media of a `Thumbnail`, `FileDisplay`,
  or `MediaGallery`."
