package_slug: "maven/com.yahoo.elide/elide-datastore-aggregation"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')"
description: "Elide is a Java library that lets you stand up a GraphQL/JSON-API web
  service with minimal effort. When leveraging the following together: Elide Aggregation
  Data Store for Analytic Queries, Parameterized Columns (A column that requires a
  client provided parameter), and a parameterized column of type TEXT. There is the
  potential for a hacker to provide a carefully crafted query that would bypass server
  side authorization filters through SQL injection. A recent patch to Elide 6.1.2
  allowed the '-' character to be included in parameterized TEXT columns. This character
  can be interpreted as SQL comments ('--') and allow the attacker to remove the WHERE
  clause from the generated query and bypass authorization filters. A fix is provided
  in Elide 6.1.4. The vulnerability only exists for parameterized columns of type
  TEXT and only for analytic queries (CRUD is not impacted). Workarounds include leveraging
  a different type of parameterized column (TIME, MONEY, etc) or not leveraging parameterized
  columns."
