package_slug: "maven/io.spinnaker.clouddriver/clouddriver-artifacts"
title: "Spinnaker vulnerable to SSRF due to improper restrictions on http from user
  input"
description: "The primary impact is allowing users to fetch data from a remote URL.
  \ This data can be then injected into Spinnaker pipelines via helm or other methods
  to extract things LIKE idmsv1 authentication data.  This ALSO includes calling INTERNAL
  Spinnaker API's via a get and similar endpoints.  Further, depending upon the artifact
  configuration, auth data may be exposed to arbitrary endpoints (e.g. GitHub auth
  headers) leading to credentials exposure.\n\nTo trigger this, a Spinnaker installation
  MUST have:\n* An artifact enabled that allows user input.  This includes GitHub
  file artifacts, BitBucket, GitLab, HTTP artifacts and similar artifact providers.
  \ JUST enabling the http artifact provider will add a \"no-auth\" http provider
  that could be used to extract link local data (e.g. AWS Metadata information).\n*
  A system that can consume the output of these artifacts.  E.g. Rosco helm can use
  this to fetch values data.  K8s account manifests if the API returns JSON can be
  used to inject that data into the pipeline itself though the pipeline would fail.\n\nTo
  note, due to the way the URLs are viable to be injected, CERTAIN systems can be
  used to provide DOS attacks on Spinnaker itself.  These would NOT compromise the
  system per se, given restarts and timeout configuration, but could lead to internal
  attacks by a Spinnaker user against Spinnaker services.  An example is that an artifact
  fetch reference could return an infinite response data feed or similar that can
  act as a DOS attack.  It's recommended to set strong limits on the various http
  limits AND artifact URLs to known valid URLs."
