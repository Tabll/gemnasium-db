title: "Potential access control security issue in apollo-adminservice"
description: "apollo-adminservice before version 1.7.1 does not implement access controls.
  If users expose apollo-adminservice to internet(which is not recommended), there
  are potential security issues since apollo-adminservice is designed to work in intranet
  and it doesn't have access control built-in. Malicious hackers may access apollo-adminservice
  apis directly to access/edit the application's configurations. To fix the potential
  issue without upgrading, simply follow the advice that do not expose apollo-adminservice
  to internet."
