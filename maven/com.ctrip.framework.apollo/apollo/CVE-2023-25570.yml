title: "Apollo has potential access control security issue in eureka"
description: "Apollo is a configuration management system. Prior to version 2.1.0,
  there are potential security issues if users expose apollo-configservice to the
  internet, which is not recommended. This is because there is no authentication feature
  enabled for the built-in eureka service. Malicious hackers may access eureka directly
  to mock apollo-configservice and apollo-adminservice. Login authentication for eureka
  was added in version 2.1.0. As a workaround, avoid exposing apollo-configservice
  to the internet."
