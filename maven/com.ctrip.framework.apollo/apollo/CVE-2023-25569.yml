title: "apollo-portal has potential CSRF issue"
description: "Apollo is a configuration management system. Prior to version 2.1.0,
  a low-privileged user can create a special web page. If an authenticated portal
  admin visits this page, the page can silently send a request to assign new roles
  for that user without any confirmation from the Portal admin. Cookie SameSite strategy
  was set to Lax in version 2.1.0. As a workaround, avoid visiting unknown source
  pages."
