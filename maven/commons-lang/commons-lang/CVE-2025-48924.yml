title: "Apache Commons Lang is vulnerable to Uncontrolled Recursion when processing
  long inputs"
description: "Uncontrolled Recursion vulnerability in Apache Commons Lang.\n\nThis
  issue affects Apache Commons Lang: Starting with commons-lang:commons-lang 2.0 to
  2.6, and, from org.apache.commons:commons-lang3 3.0 before 3.18.0.\n\nThe methods
  ClassUtils.getClass(...) can throw StackOverflowError on very long inputs. Because
  an Error is usually not handled by applications and libraries, a StackOverflowError
  could cause an application to stop.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version
  3.18.0, which fixes the issue."
