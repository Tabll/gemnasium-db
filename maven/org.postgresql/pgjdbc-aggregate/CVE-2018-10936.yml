package_slug: "maven/org.postgresql/pgjdbc-aggregate"
title: "Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch"
description: "A weakness was found in postgresql-jdbc before version 42.2.5. It was
  possible to provide an SSL Factory and not check the host name if a host name verifier
  was not provided to the driver. This could lead to a condition where a man-in-the-middle
  attacker could masquerade as a trusted server by providing a certificate for the
  wrong host, as long as it was signed by a trusted CA."
