title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')"
description: "pgjdbc, the PostgreSQL JDBC Driver, allows attacker to inject SQL if
  using PreferQueryMode=SIMPLE. Note this is not the default. In the default mode
  there is no vulnerability. A placeholder for a numeric value must be immediately
  preceded by a minus. There must be a second placeholder for a string value after
  the first placeholder; both must be on the same line. By constructing a matching
  string payload, the attacker can inject SQL to alter the query,bypassing the protections
  that parameterized queries bring against SQL Injection attacks. Versions before
  42.7.2, 42.6.1, 42.5.5, 42.4.4, 42.3.9, and 42.2.8 are affected."
