package_slug: "maven/org.postgresql/postgresql"
title: "Path traversal in org.postgresql:postgresql"
description: "** DISPUTED ** In pgjdbc before 42.3.3, an attacker (who controls the
  jdbc URL or properties) can call java.util.logging.FileHandler to write to arbitrary
  files through the loggerFile and loggerLevel connection properties. An example situation
  is that an attacker could create an executable JSP file under a Tomcat web root.
  NOTE: the vendor's position is that there is no pgjdbc vulnerability; instead, it
  is a vulnerability for any application to use the pgjdbc driver with untrusted connection
  properties."
