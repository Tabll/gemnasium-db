title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command
  Injection')"
description: "The connection properties for configuring a pgjdbc connection are not meant
  to be exposed to an unauthenticated attacker. While allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary 
  connection properties could lead to a compromise of a system, that's a defect of an application 
  that allows unauthenticated attackers that level of control. It's not the job of the pgjdbc 
  driver to decide whether a given log file location is acceptable. End user applications that 
  use the pgjdbc driver must ensure that filenames are valid and restrict unauthenticated attackers 
  from being able to supply arbitrary values. That's not specific to the pgjdbc driver either, it 
  would be true for any library that can write to the application's local file system. While we do
   not consider this a security issue with the driver, we have decided to remove the `loggerFile` 
   and `loggerLevel` connection properties in the next release of the driver. Removal of those 
   properties does not make exposing the JDBC URL or connection properties to an attacker safe 
   and we continue to suggest that applications do not allow untrusted users to specify arbitrary 
   connection properties. We are removing them to prevent misuse and their functionality can be 
   delegated to `java.util.logging`."
