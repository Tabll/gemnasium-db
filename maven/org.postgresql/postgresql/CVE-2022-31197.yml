title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')"
description: "PostgreSQL JDBC Driver (PgJDBC for short) allows Java programs to connect
  to a PostgreSQL database using standard, database independent Java code. The PGJDBC
  implementation of the `java.sql.ResultRow.refreshRow()` method is not performing
  escaping of column names so a malicious column name that contains a statement terminator,
  e.g. `;`, could lead to SQL injection. This could lead to executing additional SQL
  commands as the application's JDBC user. User applications that do not invoke the
  `ResultSet.refreshRow()` method are not impacted. User application that do invoke
  that method are impacted if the underlying database that they are querying via their
  JDBC application may be under the control of an attacker. The attack requires the
  attacker to trick the user into executing SQL against a table name who's column
  names would contain the malicious SQL and subsequently invoke the `refreshRow()`
  method on the ResultSet. Note that the application's JDBC user and the schema owner
  need not be the same. A JDBC application that executes as a privileged user querying
  database schemas owned by potentially malicious less-privileged users would be vulnerable.
  In that situation it may be possible for the malicious user to craft a schema that
  causes the application to execute commands as the privileged user. Patched versions
  will be released as `42.2.26`, `42.3.7`, and `42.4.1`. Users are advised to upgrade. There
  are no known workarounds for this issue."
