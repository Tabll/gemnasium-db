package_slug: "maven/org.postgresql/postgresql"
title: "pgjdbc Client Allows Fallback to Insecure Authentication Despite channelBinding=require
  Configuration"
description: "When the PostgreSQL JDBC driver is configured with channel binding set
  to `required` (default value is `prefer`), the driver would incorrectly allow connections
  to proceed with authentication methods that do not support channel binding (such
  as password, MD5, GSS, or SSPI  authentication). This could allow a man-in-the-middle
  attacker to intercept connections that users believed were protected by channel
  binding requirements."
