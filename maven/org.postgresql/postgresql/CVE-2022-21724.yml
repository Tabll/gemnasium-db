title: "Remote code execution vulnerability using plugin features "
description: "pgjdbc is the offical PostgreSQL JDBC Driver. A security hole was found
  in the jdbc driver for postgresql database while doing security research. The system
  using the postgresql library will be attacked when attacker control the jdbc url
  or properties. pgjdbc instantiates plugin instances based on class names provided
  via `authenticationPluginClassName`, `sslhostnameverifier`, `socketFactory`, `sslfactory`,
  `sslpasswordcallback` connection properties. However, the driver does not verify
  if the class implements the expected interface before instantiating the class. This
  can lead to remote code execution loaded via arbitrary classes."
