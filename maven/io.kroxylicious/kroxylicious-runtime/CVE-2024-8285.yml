package_slug: "maven/io.kroxylicious/kroxylicious-runtime"
title: "Missing hostname validation in Kroxylicious"
description: "A flaw was found in Kroxylicious. When establishing the connection with
  the upstream Kafka server using a TLS secured connection, Kroxylicious fails to
  properly verify the server's hostname, resulting in an insecure connection. For
  a successful attack to be performed, the attacker needs to perform a Man-in-the-Middle
  attack or compromise any external systems, such as DNS or network routing configuration.
  This issue is considered a high complexity attack, with additional high privileges
  required, as the attack would need access to the Kroxylicious configuration or a
  peer system. The result of a successful attack impacts both data integrity and confidentiality."
