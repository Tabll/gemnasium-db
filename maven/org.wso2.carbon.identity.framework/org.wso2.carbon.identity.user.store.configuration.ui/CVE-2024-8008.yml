title: "WSO2 products vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting"
description: "A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in multiple
  WSO2 products due to insufficient output encoding in error messages generated by
  the JDBC user store connection validation request. A malicious actor can inject
  a specially crafted payload into the request, causing the browser to execute arbitrary
  JavaScript in the context of the vulnerable page.\n\nThis vulnerability may allow
  UI manipulation, redirection to malicious websites, or data exfiltration from the
  browser. However, since all session-related sensitive cookies are protected with
  the httpOnly flag, session hijacking is not possible."
