title: "WSO2 is vulnerable to Open Redirect through multi-option URL in its authentication
  endpoint"
description: "An open redirection vulnerability exists in multiple WSO2 products due
  to improper validation of the multi-option URL in the authentication endpoint when
  multi-option authentication is enabled. A malicious actor can craft a valid link
  that redirects users to an attacker-controlled site.\n\nBy exploiting this vulnerability,
  an attacker may trick users into visiting a malicious page, enabling phishing attacks
  to harvest sensitive information or perform other harmful actions."
