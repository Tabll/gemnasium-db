title: "WSO2's Input Validation Management Service contains Observable Discrepancy
  when Multi-Attribute Login is enabled"
description: "A username enumeration vulnerability exists in multiple WSO2 products
  when Multi-Attribute Login is enabled. In this configuration, the system returns
  a distinct \"User does not exist\" error message to the login form, regardless of
  the validate_username setting. This behavior allows malicious actors to determine
  which usernames exist in the system based on observable discrepancies in the application's
  responses.\n\nExploitation of this vulnerability could aid in brute-force attacks,
  targeted phishing campaigns, or other social engineering techniques by confirming
  the validity of user identifiers within the system.\n\nThere is a fix available
  in version 7.8.491, however it has not been published to the Maven registry."
