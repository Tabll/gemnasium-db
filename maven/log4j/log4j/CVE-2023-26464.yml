title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** When using the Chainsaw or SocketAppender
  components with Log4j 1.x on JRE less than 1.7, an attacker that manages to cause
  a logging entry involving a specially-crafted (ie, deeply nested) hashmap or hashtable
  (depending on which logging component is in use) to be processed could exhaust the
  available memory in the virtual machine and achieve Denial of Service when the object
  is deserialized. This issue affects Apache Log4j before 2. Affected users are recommended
  to update to Log4j 2.x. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are
  no longer supported by the maintainer."
