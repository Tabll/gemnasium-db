identifiers:
- "CVE-2022-23305"
package_slug: "maven/log4j/log4j"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')"
description: "By design, the JDBCAppender in Log4j accepts an SQL statement as a configuration
  parameter where the values to be inserted are converters from PatternLayout. The
  message converter, %m, is likely to always be included. This allows attackers to
  manipulate the SQL by entering crafted strings into input fields or headers of an
  application that are logged allowing unintended SQL queries to be executed. Note
  this issue only affects Log4j when specifically configured to use the JDBCAppender,
  which is not the default. Beginning, the JDBCAppender was re-introduced with proper
  support for parameterized SQL queries and further customization over the columns
  written to in logs. Apache Log4j reached end of life in August Users should upgrade
  to Log4j 2 as it addresses numerous other issues from the previous versions."
