title: "Apache MINA SSHD: integrity check bypass"
description: "Like many other SSH implementations, Apache MINA SSHD suffered from
  the issue that is more widely known as CVE-2023-48795. An attacker that can intercept
  traffic between client and server could drop certain packets from the stream, potentially
  causing client and server to consequently end up with a connection for which\nsome
  security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin\nattack\n\nThe
  mitigations to prevent this type of attack were implemented in Apache MINA SSHD
  2.12.0, both client and server side. Users are recommended to upgrade to at least
  this version. Note that both the client and the server implementation must have
  mitigations applied against this issue, otherwise the connection may still be affected."
