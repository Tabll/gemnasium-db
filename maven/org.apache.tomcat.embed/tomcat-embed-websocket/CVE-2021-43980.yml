title: "Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race
  Condition')"
description: "The simplified implementation of blocking reads and writes introduced
  in Tomcat 10 and back-ported to Tomcat 9.0.47 onwards exposed a long standing (but
  extremely hard to trigger) concurrency bug in Apache Tomcat 10.1.0 to 10.1.0-M12,
  10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.18, 9.0.0-M1 to 9.0.60 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.77 that could cause client
  connections to share an Http11Processor instance resulting in responses, or part
  responses, to be received by the wrong client."
