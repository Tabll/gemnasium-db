title: "Information Exposure"
description: "When serving resources from a network location using the NTFS file system,
  Apache Tomcat is susceptible to JSP source code disclosure in some configurations.
  The root cause is the unexpected behaviour of the JRE API `File.getCanonicalPath()`
  which in turn is caused by the inconsistent behaviour of the Windows API (`FindFirstFileW`)
  in some circumstances."
