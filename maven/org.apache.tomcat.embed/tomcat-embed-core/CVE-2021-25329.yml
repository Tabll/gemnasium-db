description: "The fix for CVE-2020-9484 was incomplete. When using Apache Tomcat with
  a configuration edge case that was highly unlikely to be used, the Tomcat instance
  was still vulnerable to CVE-2020-9494. Note that both the previously published prerequisites
  for CVE-2020-9484 and the previously published mitigations for CVE-2020-9484 also
  apply to this issue."
