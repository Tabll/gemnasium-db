title: "Improper Locking"
description: "The fix for CVE-2019-0199 was incomplete and did not address HTTP/2
  connection window exhaustion on write in Apache Tomcat versions 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.19
  and 8.5.0 to 8.5.40 . By not sending WINDOW_UPDATE messages for the connection window
  (stream 0) clients were able to cause server-side threads to block eventually leading
  to thread exhaustion and a DoS."
