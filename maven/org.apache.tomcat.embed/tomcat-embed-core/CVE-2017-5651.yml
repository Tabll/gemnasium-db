description: "The refactoring of the HTTP connectors introduced a regression in the
  send file processing. If the file processing completed quickly, it is possible for
  the Processor to be added to the processor cache twice. This could result in the
  same Processor being used for multiple requests which in turn could lead to unexpected
  errors and/or response mix-up."
