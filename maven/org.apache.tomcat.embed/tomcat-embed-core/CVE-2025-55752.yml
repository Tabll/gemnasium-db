title: "Apache Tomcat Vulnerable to Relative Path Traversal"
description: "The fix for bug 60013 introduced a regression where the rewritten URL
  was normalized before it was decoded. This introduced the       possibility that,
  for rewrite rules that rewrite query parameters to the URL, an attacker could manipulate
  the request URI to bypass security constraints including the protection for /WEB-INF/
  and /META-INF/. If PUT requests were also enabled then malicious files could be
  uploaded leading to remote code execution. PUT requests are normally limited to
  trusted users and it is considered unlikely that PUT requests would be enabled in
  conjunction with a rewrite that manipulated the URI.\n\n\n\nThis issue affects Apache
  Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.10, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.44, from 9.0.0.M11
  through 9.0.108.\n\nThe following versions were EOL at the time the CVE was created
  but are  known to be affected: 8.5.6 though 8.5.100. Other, older, EOL versions
  may also be affected. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.11 or later,
  10.1.45 or later or 9.0.109 or later, which fix the issue."
