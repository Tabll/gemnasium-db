identifier: "CVE-2017-5648"
package_slug: "maven/org.apache.tomcat.embed/tomcat-embed-core"
title: "Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere"
description: "Some calls to application listeners in Apache Tomcat did not use the
  appropriate facade object. When running an untrusted application under a SecurityManager,
  it was therefore possible for that untrusted application to retain a reference to
  the request or response object and thereby access and/or modify information associated
  with another web application."
