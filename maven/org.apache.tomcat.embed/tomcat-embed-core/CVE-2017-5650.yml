identifier: "CVE-2017-5650"
package_slug: "maven/org.apache.tomcat.embed/tomcat-embed-core"
title: "Improper Resource Shutdown or Release"
description: "The handling of an HTTP/2 `GOAWAY` frame for a connection did not close
  streams associated with that connection that were currently waiting for a `WINDOW_UPDATE`
  before allowing the application to write more data. These waiting streams each consumed
  a thread. A malicious client could therefore construct a series of HTTP/2 requests
  that would consume all available processing threads."
