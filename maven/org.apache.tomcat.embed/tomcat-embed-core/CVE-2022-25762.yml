package_slug: "maven/org.apache.tomcat.embed/tomcat-embed-core"
title: "Improper Resource Shutdown or Release"
description: "If a web application sends a WebSocket message concurrently with the
  WebSocket connection closing when running on Apache Tomcat 8.5.0 to 8.5.75 or Apache
  Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.20, it is possible that the application will continue to
  use the socket after it has been closed. The error handling triggered in this case
  could cause the a pooled object to be placed in the pool twice. This could result
  in subsequent connections using the same object concurrently which could result
  in data being returned to the wrong use and/or other errors."
