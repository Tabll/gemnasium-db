package_slug: "maven/io.netty.incubator/netty-incubator-codec-bhttp"
title: "Absent Input Validation in BinaryHttpParser"
description: "`BinaryHttpParser` does not properly validate input values thus giving
  attackers almost complete control over the HTTP requests constructed from the parsed
  output. Attackers can abuse several issues individually to perform various injection
  attacks including HTTP request smuggling, desync attacks, HTTP header injections,
  request queue poisoning, caching attacks and Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
  Attacker could also combine several issues to create well-formed messages for other
  text-based protocols which may result in attacks beyond the HTTP protocol."
