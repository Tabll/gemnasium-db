title: "BoringSSLAEADContext in Netty Repeats Nonces"
description: "BoringSSLAEADContext keeps track of how many OHTTP responses have been
  sent and uses this sequence number to calculate the appropriate nonce to use with
  the encryption algorithm.\nUnfortunately, two separate errors combine which would
  allow an attacker to cause the sequence number to overflow and thus the nonce to
  repeat."
