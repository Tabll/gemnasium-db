title: "OpenDJ Denial of Service (DoS) using alias loop"
description: "A denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability in OpenDJ has been discovered
  that causes the server to become unresponsive to all LDAP requests without crashing
  or restarting. This issue occurs when an alias loop exists in the LDAP database.
  If an `ldapsearch` request is executed with alias dereferencing set to \"always\"
  on this alias entry, the server stops responding to all future requests.\nI have
  confirmed this issue using the latest OpenDJ version (9.2), both with the official
  OpenDJ Docker image and a local OpenDJ server running on my Windows 10 machine."
