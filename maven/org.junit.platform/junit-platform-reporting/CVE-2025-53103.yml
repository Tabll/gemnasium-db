title: "junit-platform-reporting can leak Git credentials through its OpenTestReportGeneratingListener "
description: "This vulnerability affects JUnit's support for writing Open Test Reporting
  XML files which is an opt-in feature of `junit-platform-reporting`.\n\nIf a repository
  is cloned using a GitHub token or other credentials in its URL, for example:\n\n```bash\ngit
  clone https://${GH_APP}:${GH_TOKEN}@github.com/example/example.git\n```\n\nThe credentials
  are captured by `OpenTestReportGeneratingListener` which produces (trimmed for brevity):\n\n```xml\n<infrastructure>\n<git:repository
  originUrl=\"https://username:token@github.com/example/example.git\" />\n</infrastructure>\n```"
