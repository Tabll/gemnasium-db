package_slug: "maven/org.tensorflow/parentpom"
title: "Use of Uninitialized Resource"
description: "In affected versions of TensorFlow under certain cases, loading a saved
  model can result in accessing uninitialized memory while building the computation
  graph. The `MakeEdge` function creates an edge between one output tensor of the
  src node (given by `output_index`) and the input slot of the dst node (given by
  `input_index`). This is only possible if the types of the tensors on both sides
  coincide, so the function begins by obtaining the corresponding `DataType` values
  and comparing these for equality. However, there is no check that the indices point
  to inside of the arrays they index into. Thus, this can result in accessing data
  out-of-bounds of the corresponding heap allocated arrays. In most scenarios, this
  can manifest as unitialized data access, but if the index points far away from the
  boundaries of the arrays this can be used to leak addresses from the library."
