identifier: "CVE-2020-26268"
package_slug: "maven/org.tensorflow/parentpom"
title: "Out-of-bounds Write"
description: "In affected versions of TensorFlow the `tf.raw_ops.ImmutableConst` operation
  returns a constant tensor created from a memory mapped file which is assumed immutable.
  However, if the type of the tensor is not an integral type, the operation crashes
  the Python interpreter as it tries to write to the memory area. If the file is too
  small, TensorFlow properly returns an error as the memory area has fewer bytes than
  what is needed for the tensor it creates. However, as soon as there are enough bytes,
  the above snippet causes a segmentation fault. This is because the allocator used
  to return the buffer data is not marked as returning an opaque handle since the
  needed virtual method is not overridden."
