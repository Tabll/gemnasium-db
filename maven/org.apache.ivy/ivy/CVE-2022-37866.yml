package_slug: "maven/org.apache.ivy/ivy"
title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "When Apache Ivy downloads artifacts from a repository it stores them
  in the local file system based on a user-supplied \"pattern\" that may include placeholders
  for artifacts coordinates like the organisation, module or version. If said coordinates
  contain \"../\" sequences - which are valid characters for Ivy coordinates in general
  - it is possible the artifacts are stored outside of Ivy's local cache or repository
  or can overwrite different artifacts inside of the local cache. In order to exploit
  this vulnerability an attacker needs collaboration by the remote repository as Ivy
  will issue http requests containing \"..\" sequences and a \"normal\" repository
  will not interpret them as part of the artifact coordinates. Users of Apache Ivy
  2.0.0 to 2.5.1 should upgrade to Ivy 2.5.1."
