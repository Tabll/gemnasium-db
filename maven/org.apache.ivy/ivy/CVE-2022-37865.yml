package_slug: "maven/org.apache.ivy/ivy"
title: "Apache Ivy does not verify target path when extracting the archive"
description: "With Apache Ivy 2.4.0 an optional packaging attribute has been introduced
  that allows artifacts to be unpacked on the fly if they used pack200 or zip packaging.
  For artifacts using the \"zip\", \"jar\" or \"war\" packaging Ivy prior to 2.5.1
  does not verify the target path when extracting the archive. An archive containing
  absolute paths or paths that try to traverse \"upwards\" using \"..\" sequences
  can then write files to any location on the local fie system that the user executing
  Ivy has write access to. Ivy users of version 2.4.0 to 2.5.0 should upgrade to Ivy
  2.5.1."
