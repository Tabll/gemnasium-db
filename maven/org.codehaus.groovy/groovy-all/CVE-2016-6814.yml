title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data in Groovy"
description: "When an application with unsupported Codehaus versions of Groovy from
  1.7.0 to 2.4.3, Apache Groovy 2.4.4 to 2.4.7 on classpath uses standard Java serialization
  mechanisms, e.g. to communicate between servers or to store local data, it was possible
  for an attacker to bake a special serialized object that will execute code directly
  when deserialized. All applications which rely on serialization and do not isolate
  the code which deserializes objects were subject to this vulnerability."
