title: "Information Disclosure in Apache Groovy"
description: "Apache Groovy provides extension methods to aid with creating temporary
  directories. Prior to this fix, Groovy's implementation of those extension methods
  was using a now superseded Java JDK method call that is potentially not secure on
  some operating systems in some contexts. Users not using the extension methods mentioned
  in the advisory are not affected, but may wish to read the advisory for further
  details. Versions Affected: 2.0 to 2.4.20, 2.5.0 to 2.5.13, 3.0.0 to 3.0.6, and
  4.0.0-alpha-1. Fixed in versions 2.4.21, 2.5.14, 3.0.7, 4.0.0-alpha-2."
