package_slug: "maven/org.eclipse.parsson/project"
title: "Eclipse Parsson Denial of Service vulnerability"
description: "In Eclipse Parsson before versions 1.1.4 and 1.0.5, Parsing JSON from
  untrusted sources can lead malicious actors to exploit the fact that the built-in
  support for parsing numbers with large scale in Java has a number of edge cases
  where the input text of a number can lead to much larger processing time than one
  would expect.\n\n\nTo mitigate the risk, parsson put in place a size limit for the
  numbers as well as their scale.\n\n\n"
