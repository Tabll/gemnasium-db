package_slug: "maven/org.apache.druid/druid"
title: "Incorrect Authorization"
description: "In the Druid ingestion system, the InputSource is used for reading data
  from a certain data source. However, the HTTP InputSource allows authenticated users
  to read data from other sources than intended, such as the local file system, with
  the privileges of the Druid server process. This is not an elevation of privilege
  when users access Druid directly, since Druid also provides the Local InputSource,
  which allows the same level of access. But it is problematic when users interact
  with Druid indirectly through an application that allows users to specify the HTTP
  InputSource, but not the Local InputSource. In this case, users could bypass the
  application-level restriction by passing a file URL to the HTTP InputSource."
