identifier: "CVE-2021-25646"
package_slug: "maven/org.apache.druid/druid"
title: "Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource"
description: "Apache Druid includes the ability to execute user-provided JavaScript
  code embedded in various types of requests. This functionality is intended for use
  in high-trust environments, and is disabled by default. However, in Druid, it is
  possible for an authenticated user to send a specially-crafted request that forces
  Druid to run user-provided JavaScript code for that request, regardless of server
  configuration. This can be leveraged to execute code on the target machine with
  the privileges of the Druid server process."
