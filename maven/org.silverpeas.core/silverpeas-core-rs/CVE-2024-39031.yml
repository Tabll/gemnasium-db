package_slug: "maven/org.silverpeas.core/silverpeas-core-rs"
title: "Silverpeas Core Cross-site Scripting vulnerability"
description: "In Silverpeas Core <= 6.3.5, in Mes Agendas, a user can create new events
  and add them to their calendar. Additionally, users can invite others from the same
  domain, including administrators, to these events. A standard user can inject an
  XSS payload into the \"Titre\" and \"Description\" fields when creating an event
  and then add the administrator or any user to the event. When the invited user (victim)
  views their own profile, the payload will be executed on their side, even if they
  do not click on the event."
