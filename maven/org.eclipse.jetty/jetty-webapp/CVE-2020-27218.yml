identifier: "CVE-2020-27218"
package_slug: "maven/org.eclipse.jetty/jetty-webapp"
title: "Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types"
description: "If GZIP request body inflation is enabled and requests from different
  clients are multiplexed onto a single connection, and if an attacker can send a
  request with a body that is received entirely but not consumed by the application,
  then a subsequent request on the same connection will see that body prepended to
  its body. The attacker will not see any data but may inject data into the body of
  the subsequent request."
