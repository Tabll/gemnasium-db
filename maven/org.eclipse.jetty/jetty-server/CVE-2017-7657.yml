title: "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request Smuggling')"
description: "In Eclipse Jetty, versions 9.2.x and older, 9.3.x (all configurations),
  and 9.4.x (non-default configuration with RFC2616 compliance enabled), transfer-encoding
  chunks are handled poorly. The chunk length parsing was vulnerable to an integer
  overflow. Thus a large chunk size could be interpreted as a smaller chunk size and
  content sent as chunk body could be interpreted as a pipelined request. If Jetty
  was deployed behind an intermediary that imposed some authorization and that intermediary
  allowed arbitrarily large chunks to be passed on unchanged, then this flaw could
  be used to bypass the authorization imposed by the intermediary as the fake pipelined
  request would not be interpreted by the intermediary as a request."
