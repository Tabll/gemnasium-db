title: "Jetty Uses Predictable Session Identifiers"
description: "Jetty before 4.2.27, 5.1 before 5.1.12, 6.0 before 6.0.2, and 6.1 before
  6.1.0pre3 generates predictable session identifiers using java.util.random, which
  makes it easier for remote attackers to guess a session identifier through brute
  force attacks, bypass authentication requirements, and possibly conduct cross-site
  request forgery attacks."
