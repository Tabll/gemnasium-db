package_slug: "maven/org.eclipse.jetty/jetty-server"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Quoting Syntax"
description: "Eclipse Jetty Canonical Repository is the canonical repository for the
  Jetty project. Users of the CgiServlet with a very specific command structure may
  have the wrong command executed. If a user sends a request to a org.eclipse.jetty.servlets.CGI
  Servlet for a binary with a space in its name, the servlet will escape the command
  by wrapping it in quotation marks. This wrapped command, plus an optional command
  prefix, will then be executed through a call to Runtime.exec. If the original binary
  name provided by the user contains a quotation mark followed by a space, the resulting
  command line will contain multiple tokens instead of one. This issue was patched
  in version 9.4.52, 10.0.16, 11.0.16 and 12.0.0-beta2.\n"
