description: "In Eclipse Jetty RC0 to v20201102 alpha0 to beta2 alpha0 to beta2, if
  GZIP request body inflation is enabled and requests from different clients are multiplexed
  onto a single connection, and if an attacker can send a request with a body that
  is received entirely but not consumed by the application, then a subsequent request
  on the same connection will see that body prepended to its body. The attacker will
  not see any data but may inject data into the body of the subsequent request."
