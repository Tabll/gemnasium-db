package_slug: "maven/org.eclipse.jetty/jetty-openid"
title: "Jetty's OpenId Revoked authentication allows one request"
description: "If a Jetty `OpenIdAuthenticator` uses the optional nested `LoginService`,
  and that `LoginService` decides to revoke an already authenticated user, then the
  current request will still treat the user as authenticated. The authentication is
  then cleared from the session and subsequent requests will not be treated as authenticated.
  \n\nSo a request on a previously authenticated session could be allowed to bypass
  authentication after it had been rejected by the `LoginService`.\n\n### Impact\nThis
  impacts usages of the jetty-openid which have configured a nested `LoginService`
  and where that `LoginService` will is capable of rejecting previously authenticated
  users."
