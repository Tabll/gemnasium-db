identifier: "CVE-2020-27216"
package_slug: "maven/org.eclipse.jetty/jetty-client"
title: "Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions"
description: "In Eclipse Jetty on Unix like systems, the system's temporary directory
  is shared between all users on that system. A collocated user can observe the process
  of creating a temporary sub directory in the shared temporary directory and race
  to complete the creation of the temporary subdirectory. If the attacker wins the
  race then they will have read and write permission to the subdirectory used to unpack
  web applications, including their `WEB-INF/lib` jar files and JSP files. If any
  code is ever executed out of this temporary directory, this can lead to a local
  privilege escalation vulnerability."
