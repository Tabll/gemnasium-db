identifier: "CVE-2017-7657"
package_slug: "maven/org.eclipse.jetty/jetty-client"
title: "Integer Overflow or Wraparound"
description: "Transfer-encoding chunks are handled poorly. The chunk length parsing
  was vulnerable to an integer overflow. A large chunk size could be interpreted as
  a smaller chunk size and content sent as chunk body could be interpreted as a pipelined
  request. If Jetty was deployed behind an intermediary that imposed some authorization
  and that intermediary allowed arbitrarily large chunks to be passed on unchanged,
  then this flaw could be used to bypass the authorization imposed by the intermediary
  as the fake pipelined request would not be interpreted by the intermediary as a
  request."
