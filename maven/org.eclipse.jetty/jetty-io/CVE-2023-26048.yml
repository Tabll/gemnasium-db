title: "Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling"
description: "Jetty is a java based web server and servlet engine. In affected versions
  servlets with multipart support (e.g. annotated with `@MultipartConfig`) that call
  `HttpServletRequest.getParameter()` or `HttpServletRequest.getParts()` may cause
  `OutOfMemoryError` when the client sends a multipart request with a part that has
  a name but no filename and very large content. This happens even with the default
  settings of `fileSizeThreshold=0` which should stream the whole part content to
  disk. An attacker client may send a large multipart request and cause the server
  to throw `OutOfMemoryError`. However, the server may be able to recover after the
  `OutOfMemoryError` and continue its service -- although it may take some time. This
  issue has been patched in versions 9.4.51, 10.0.14, and 11.0.14. Users are advised
  to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may set the multipart parameter `maxRequestSize`
  which must be set to a non-negative value, so the whole multipart content is limited
  (although still read into memory)."
