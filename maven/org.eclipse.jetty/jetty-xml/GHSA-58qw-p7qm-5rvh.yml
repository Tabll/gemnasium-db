title: "Eclipse Jetty XmlParser allows arbitrary DOCTYPE declarations"
description: "There are no circumstances in a normally deployed Jetty server where
  potentially hostile XML is given to the XmlParser class without the attacker already
  having arbitrary access to the server. I.e. in order to exploit `XmlParser` the
  attacker would already have the ability to deploy and execute hostile code.  Specifically,
  Jetty has no protection against malicious web application and potentially hostile
  web applications should only be run on an isolated virtualisation.\n\nThus this
  is not considered a vulnerability of the Jetty server itself, as any such usage
  of the jetty XmlParser is equally vulnerable as a direct usage of the JVM supplied
  SAX parser.  No CVE will be allocated to this advisory.\n\nHowever, any direct usage
  of the `XmlParser` class by an application may be vulnerable.  The impact would
  greatly depend on how the application uses `XmlParser`, but it could be a denial
  of service due to large entity expansion, or possibly the revealing local files
  if the XML results are accessible remotely."
