title: "Eclipse Jetty URI parsing of invalid authority"
description: "Eclipse Jetty is a lightweight, highly scalable, Java-based web server
  and Servlet engine . It includes a utility class, `HttpURI`, for URI/URL parsing.\n\nThe
  `HttpURI` class does insufficient validation on the authority segment of a URI.
  \ However the behaviour of `HttpURI` differs from the common browsers in how it
  handles a URI that would be considered invalid if fully validated against the RRC.
  \ Specifically `HttpURI` and the browser may differ on the value of the host extracted
  from an invalid URI and thus a combination of Jetty and a vulnerable browser may
  be vulnerable to a open redirect attack or to a SSRF attack if the URI is used after
  passing validation checks."
