package_slug: "maven/org.pac4j/pac4j-core"
title: "Token validation bypass in Pac4j"
description: "Pac4j v5.1 and earlier allows (by default) clients to accept and successfully
  validate ID Tokens with \"none\" algorithm (i.e., tokens with no signature) which
  is not secure and violates the OpenID Core Specification. The \"none\" algorithm
  does not require any signature verification when validating the ID tokens, which
  allows the attacker to bypass the token validation by injecting a malformed ID token
  using \"none\" as the value of \"alg\" key in the header with an empty signature
  value."
