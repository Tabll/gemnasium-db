identifiers:
- "CVE-2021-44878"
package_slug: "maven/org.pac4j/pac4j-saml"
title: "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature"
description: "Pac4j v5.1 allows (by default) clients to accept and successfully validate
  ID Tokens with `none` algorithm (i.e., tokens with no signature) which is not secure
  and violates the OpenID Core Specification. The `none` algorithm does not require
  any signature verification when validating the ID tokens, which allows the attacker
  to bypass the token validation by injecting a malformed ID token using `none` as
  the value of `alg` key in the header with an empty signature value."
