title: "Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties"
description: "A change introduced in Apache Flink 1.11.0 (and released in 1.11.1 and
  1.11.2 as well) allows attackers to read any file on the local filesystem of the
  JobManager through the REST interface of the JobManager process. Access is restricted
  to files accessible by the JobManager process. All users should upgrade to Flink
  1.11.3 or 1.12.0 if their Flink instance(s) are exposed. The issue was fixed in
  commit b561010b0ee741543c3953306037f00d7a9f0801 from apache/flink:master."
