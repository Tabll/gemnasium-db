identifier: "CVE-2020-1960"
package_slug: "maven/org.apache.flink/flink-metrics-core"
title: "Injection Vulnerability"
description: "When running a process with an enabled `JMXReporter`, with a port configured
  via `metrics.reporter.reporter_name` > `.port`, an attacker with local access to
  the machine and JMX port can execute a man-in-the-middle attack using a specially
  crafted request to rebind the `JMXRMI` registry to one under the attacker's control.
  This compromises any connection established to the process via JMX, allowing extraction
  of credentials and any other transferred data."
