title: "Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties"
description: "A change introduced in Apache Flink (and released as well) allows attackers
  to read any file on the local filesystem of the JobManager through the REST interface
  of the JobManager process. Access is restricted to files accessible by the JobManager
  process. All users should upgrade to Flink if their Flink instance(s) are exposed.
  The issue was fixed in commit b561010b0ee741543c3953306037f00d7a9f0801 from
  `apache/flink:master.`"
