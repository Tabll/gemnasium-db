package_slug: "maven/uk.ac.ed.ph.qtiworks/qtiworks-engine"
title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "QTIWorks is a software suite for standards-based assessment delivery.
  Prior to version 1.0-beta15, the QTIWorks Engine allows users to upload QTI content
  packages as ZIP files. The ZIP handling code does not sufficiently check the paths
  of files contained within ZIP files, so can insert files into other locations in
  the filesystem if they are writable by the process running the QTIWorks Engine.
  In extreme cases, this could allow anonymous users to change files in arbitrary
  locations in the filesystem. In normal QTIWorks Engine deployments, the impact is
  somewhat reduced because the default QTIWorks configuration does not enable the
  public demo functionality, so ZIP files can only be uploaded by users with \"instructor\"
  privileges. This vulnerability is fixed in version 1.0-beta15. There are no database
  configuration changes required when upgrading to this version. No known workarounds
  for this issue exist."
