description: "A vulnerability in the API of SonarSource SonarQube before 7.4 could
  allow an authenticated user to discover sensitive information such as valid user-account
  logins in the web application. The vulnerability occurs because of improperly configured
  access controls that cause the API to return the externalIdentity field to non-administrator
  users. The attacker could use this information in subsequent attacks against the
  system."
