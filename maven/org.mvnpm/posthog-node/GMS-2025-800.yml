title: "posthog-node compromised with credential-harvesting malware"
description: "On November 25th 2025, the Shai-Hulud 2.0 supply chain attack spread to Maven Central
  through automated mirroring of compromised npm packages. The org.mvnpm:posthog-node:4.18.1 package
  contains malicious code that attempts to harvest credentials and infect GitHub repositories. The malware
  was automatically mirrored from the compromised npm version via the mvnpm process that rebuilds npm packages
  as Maven artifacts. The malicious software executes during the build phase and attempts to harvest credentials
  from popular online services. It is recommended all credentials be rotated, Maven cache is cleared,
  target directories are removed and all dependencies be rolled back to previous versions."
