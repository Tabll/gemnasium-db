title: "Maven Archetype Plugin: Maven Archetype integration-test may package local
  settings into the published artifact, possibly containing credentials"
description: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor, Insecure
  Storage of Sensitive Information vulnerability in Maven Archetype Plugin.\n\nThis
  issue affects Maven Archetype Plugin: from 3.2.1 before 3.3.0.\n\nUsers are recommended
  to upgrade to version 3.3.0, which fixes the issue.\n\nArchetype integration testing
  creates a file\ncalled ./target/classes/archetype-it/archetype-settings.xml\nThis
  file contains all the content from the users ~/.m2/settings.xml file,\nwhich often
  contains information they do not want to publish. We expect that on many developer
  machines, this also contains\ncredentials.\n\nWhen the user runs mvn verify again
  (without a mvn clean), this file becomes part of the final artifact.\n\nIf a developer
  were to publish this into Maven Central or any other remote repository (whether
  as a release or a snapshot) their credentials would be published without them knowing."
