title: "Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling"
description: "snappy-java is a Java port of the snappy, a fast C++ compresser/decompresser
  developed by Google. The SnappyInputStream was found to be vulnerable to Denial
  of Service (DoS) attacks when decompressing data with a too large chunk size. Due
  to missing upper bound check on chunk length, an unrecoverable fatal error can occur.
  All versions of snappy-java including the latest released version 1.1.10.3 is vulnerable
  to this issue. A fix has been introduced in commit `9f8c3cf74` which will be included
  in the 1.1.10.4 release. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should
  only accept compressed data from trusted sources."
