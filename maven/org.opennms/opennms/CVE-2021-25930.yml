title: "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
description: "In OpenNMS Horizon, versions opennms-1-0-stable through opennms-27.1.0-1;
  OpenNMS Meridian, versions meridian-foundation-2015.1.0-1 through meridian-foundation-2019.1.18-1;
  meridian-foundation-2020.1.0-1 through meridian-foundation-2020.1.6-1 are vulnerable
  to CSRF, due to no CSRF protection, and since there is no validation of an existing
  user name while renaming a user. As a result, privileges of the renamed user are
  being overwritten by the old user and the old user is being deleted from the user
  list."
