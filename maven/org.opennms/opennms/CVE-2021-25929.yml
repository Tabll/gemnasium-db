title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "In OpenNMS Horizon, versions opennms-1-0-stable through opennms-27.1.0-1;
  OpenNMS Meridian, versions meridian-foundation-2015.1.0-1 through meridian-foundation-2019.1.18-1;
  meridian-foundation-2020.1.0-1 through meridian-foundation-2020.1.6-1 are vulnerable
  to Stored Cross-Site Scripting since there is no validation on the input being sent
  to the `name` parameter in `noticeWizard` endpoint. Due to this flaw an authenticated
  attacker could inject arbitrary script and trick other admin users into downloading
  malicious files."
