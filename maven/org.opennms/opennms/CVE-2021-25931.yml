package_slug: "maven/org.opennms/opennms"
title: "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
description: "In OpenNMS Horizon, versions opennms-1-0-stable through opennms-27.1.0-1;
  OpenNMS Meridian, versions meridian-foundation-2015.1.0-1 through meridian-foundation-2019.1.18-1;
  meridian-foundation-2020.1.0-1 through meridian-foundation-2020.1.6-1 are vulnerable
  to CSRF, due to no CSRF protection at `/opennms/admin/userGroupView/users/updateUser`.
  This flaw allows assigning `ROLE_ADMIN` security role to a normal user. Using this
  flaw, an attacker can trick the admin user to assign administrator privileges to
  a normal user by enticing him to click upon an attacker-controlled website."
