package_slug: "maven/org.opennms/opennms"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "In OpenNMS Horizon, versions opennms-18.0.0-1 through opennms-27.1.0-1;
  OpenNMS Meridian, versions meridian-foundation-2015.1.0-1 through meridian-foundation-2019.1.18-1;
  meridian-foundation-2020.1.0-1 through meridian-foundation-2020.1.7-1 is vulnerable
  to Stored Cross-Site Scripting, since the function `createRequisitionedNode()` does
  not perform any validation checks on the input sent to the `node-label` parameter.
  Due to this flaw an attacker could inject an arbitrary script which will be stored
  in the database."
