title: "Cross-site Scripting in OpenNMS Horizon"
description: "In OpenNMS Horizon, versions opennms-1-0-stable through opennms-27.1.1;
  OpenNMS Meridian, versions meridian-foundation-2015.1.0-1 through meridian-foundation-2019.1.18-1;
  meridian-foundation-2020.1.0-1 through meridian-foundation-2020.1.6-1 are vulnerable
  to Stored Cross-Site Scripting, since the function `validateFormInput()` performs
  improper validation checks on the input sent to the `groupName` and `groupComment`
  parameters. Due to this flaw, an authenticated attacker could inject arbitrary script
  and trick other admin users into downloading malicious files which can cause severe
  damage to the organization using opennms."
