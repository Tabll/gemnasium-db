title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "Multiple reflected XSS were found on different JSP files with unsanitized
  parameters in OpenMNS Horizon 31.0.8 and versions earlier than 32.0.2 on multiple
  platforms that an attacker can modify to craft a malicious XSS payload. The solution
  is to upgrade to Meridian 2023.1.6, 2022.1.19, 2021.1.30, 2020.1.38 or Horizon 32.0.2
  or newer. Meridian and Horizon installation instructions state that they are intended
  for installation within an organization's private networks and should not be directly
  accessible from the Internet. OpenNMS thanks Jordi Miralles Comins for reporting
  this issue.\n"
