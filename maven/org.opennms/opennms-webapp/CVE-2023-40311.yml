title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "Multiple stored XSS were found on different JSP files with unsanitized
  parameters in OpenMNS Horizon 31.0.8 and versions earlier than 32.0.2 on multiple
  platforms that allow an attacker to store on database and then load on JSPs or Angular
  templates. The solution is to upgrade to Meridian 2023.1.6, 2022.1.19, 2021.1.30,
  2020.1.38 or Horizon 32.0.2 or newer. Meridian and Horizon installation instructions
  state that they are intended for installation within an organization's private networks
  and should not be directly accessible from the Internet. OpenNMS thanksÂ Jordi Miralles
  Comins for reporting this issue.\n"
