title: "Apache Hive Code Injection vulnerability"
description: "Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') vulnerability
  in Apache Hive.\n\nThe vulnerability affects the Hive JDBC driver component and
  it can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution on the machine/endpoint that
  the JDBC driver (client) is running. The malicious user must have sufficient permissions
  to specify/edit JDBC URL(s) in an endpoint relying on the Hive JDBC driver and the
  JDBC client process must run under a privileged user to fully exploit the vulnerability.\n\nThe
  attacker can setup a malicious HTTP server and specify a JDBC URL pointing towards
  this server. When a JDBC connection is attempted, the malicious HTTP server can
  provide a special response with customized payload that can trigger the execution
  of certain commands in the JDBC client.This issue affects Apache Hive: from 4.0.0-alpha-1
  before 4.0.0.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 4.0.0, which fixes
  the issue."
