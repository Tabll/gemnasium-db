identifier: "CVE-2016-3083"
package_slug: "maven/org.apache.hive/hive"
title: "Improper Certificate Validation"
description: "Apache Hive (JDBC + HiveServer2) implements SSL for plain TCP and HTTP
  connections (it supports both transport modes). While validating the server's certificate
  during the connection setup, the client in Apache Hive does not seem to be verifying
  the common name attribute of the certificate. In this way, if a JDBC client sends
  an SSL request to server `abc.com`, and the server responds with a valid certificate
  (certified by CA) but issued to `xyz.com`, the client will accept that as a valid
  certificate and the SSL handshake will go through."
