title: "Hive Metastore Server is vulnerable to SQL Injection"
description: "SQL injection vulnerability in Hive Metastore Server (HMS) when processing
  delete column statistics requests via the Thrift APIs. The vulnerability is only
  exploitable by trusted/authorized users/applications that are allowed to call directly
  the Thrift APIs. In most real-world deployments, HMS is accessible to only a handful
  of applications (e.g., Hiveserver2) thus the vulnerability is not exploitable. Moreover,
  the vulnerable code cannot be reached when metastore.try.direct.sql property is
  set to false.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Hive: from 4.1.0 before 4.2.0.\n\nUsers
  are recommended to upgrade to version 4.2.0, which fixes the issue. Users who cannot
  upgrade directly are encouraged to set metastore.try.direct.sql property to false
  if the HMS Thrift APIs are exposed to general public."
