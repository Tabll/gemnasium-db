package_slug: "maven/org.apache.hive/hive-exec"
title: "Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource"
description: "In Apache Hive 2.1.0 to 2.3.2, when 'COPY FROM FTP' statement is run
  using HPL/SQL extension to Hive, a compromised/malicious FTP server can cause the
  file to be written to an arbitrary location on the cluster where the command is
  run from. This is because FTP client code in HPL/SQL does not verify the destination
  location of the downloaded file. This does not affect hive cli user and hiveserver2
  user as hplsql is a separate command line script and needs to be invoked differently."
