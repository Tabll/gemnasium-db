package_slug: "maven/org.keycloak/keycloak-wildfly-server-subsystem"
title: "Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information"
description: "A flaw was found in the Keycloak package, more specifically org.keycloak.userprofile.
  When a user registers itself through registration flow, the \"password\" and \"password-confirm\"
  field from the form will occur as regular user attributes. All users and clients
  with proper rights and roles are able to read users attributes, allowing a malicious
  user with minimal access to retrieve the users passwords in clear text, jeopardizing
  their environment."
