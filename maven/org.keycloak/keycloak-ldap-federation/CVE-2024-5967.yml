package_slug: "maven/org.keycloak/keycloak-ldap-federation"
title: "Keycloak leaks configured LDAP bind credentials through the Keycloak admin
  console"
description: "The LDAP testing endpoint allows to change the Connection URL independently
  of and without having to re-enter the currently configured LDAP bind credentials.
  An attacker with admin access (permission manage-realm) can change the LDAP host
  URL (\"Connection URL\") to a machine they control. The Keycloak server will connect
  to the attacker's host and try to authenticate with the configured credentials,
  thus leaking them to the attacker.\nAs a consequence, an attacker who has compromised
  the admin console/compromised a user with sufficient privileges can leak domain
  credentials and can now attack the domain."
