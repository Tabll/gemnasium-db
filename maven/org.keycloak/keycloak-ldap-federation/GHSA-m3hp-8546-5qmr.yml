title: "Duplicate Advisory: Authentication Bypass Due to Missing LDAP Bind After Password
  Reset in Keycloak "
description: "# Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-2p82-5wwr-43cw. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n# Original Description\n\nA flaw was found in Keycloak. When an Active
  Directory user resets their password, the system updates it without performing an
  LDAP bind to validate the new credentials against AD. This vulnerability allows
  users whose AD accounts are expired or disabled to regain access in Keycloak, bypassing
  AD restrictions. The issue enables authentication bypass and could allow unauthorized
  access under certain conditions."
