title: "Authentication Bypass Due to Missing LDAP Bind After Password Reset in Keycloak "
description: "A flaw was found in Keycloak. When an Active Directory user resets their
  password, the system updates it without performing an LDAP bind to validate the
  new credentials against AD. This vulnerability allows users whose AD accounts are
  expired or disabled to regain access in Keycloak, bypassing AD restrictions. The
  issue enables authentication bypass and could allow unauthorized access under certain
  conditions."
