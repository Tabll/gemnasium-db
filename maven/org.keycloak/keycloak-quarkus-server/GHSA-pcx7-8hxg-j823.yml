title: "Duplicate Advisory: Keycloak proxy header handling Denial-of-Service (DoS)
  vulnerability"
description: "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-jgwc-jh89-rpgq. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n## Original Description\nA vulnerability was found in the Keycloak
  Server. The Keycloak Server is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack due
  to improper handling of proxy headers. When Keycloak is configured to accept incoming
  proxy headers, it may accept non-IP values, such as obfuscated identifiers, without
  proper validation. This issue can lead to costly DNS resolution operations, which
  an attacker could exploit to tie up IO threads and potentially cause a denial of
  service.\nThe attacker must have access to send requests to a Keycloak instance
  that is configured to accept proxy headers, specifically when reverse proxies do
  not overwrite incoming headers, and Keycloak is configured to trust these headers."
