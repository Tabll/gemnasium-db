package_slug: "maven/org.keycloak/keycloak-quarkus-server"
title: "Keycloak unable to restrict access to the admin console"
description: "A flaw was found in Keycloak. The Keycloak guides recommend to not expose
  /admin path to the outside in case the installation is using a proxy. The issue
  occurs at least via ha-proxy, as it can be tricked to using relative/non-normalized
  paths to access the /admin application path relative to /realms which is expected
  to be exposed."
