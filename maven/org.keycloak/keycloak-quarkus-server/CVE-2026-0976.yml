title: "Keycloak has an improper input validation vulnerability"
description: "A flaw was found in Keycloak. This improper input validation vulnerability
  occurs because Keycloak accepts RFC-compliant matrix parameters in URL path segments,
  while common reverse proxy configurations may ignore or mishandle them. A remote
  attacker can craft requests to mask path segments, potentially bypassing proxy-level
  path filtering. This could expose administrative or sensitive endpoints that operators
  believe are not externally reachable."
