package_slug: "maven/org.keycloak/keycloak-quarkus-server"
title: "Keycloak Build Process Exposes Sensitive Data"
description: "A flaw was found in Keycloak. This issue occurs because sensitive runtime
  values, such as passwords, may be captured during the Keycloak build process and
  embedded as default values in bytecode, leading to unintended information disclosure.
  In Keycloak 26, sensitive data specified directly in environment variables during
  the build process is also stored as a default values, making it accessible during
  runtime. Indirect usage of environment variables for SPI options and Quarkus properties
  is also vulnerable due to unconditional expansion by PropertyMapper logic, capturing
  sensitive data as default values in all Keycloak versions up to 26.0.2."
