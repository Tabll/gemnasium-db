title: "Duplicate Advisory:  Keycloak allows access to admin path through flaw"
description: "### Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it
  is a duplicate of GHSA-j4vq-q93m-4683. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n### Original Description\nA flaw was found in Keycloak. The Keycloak
  guides recommend to not expose /admin path to the outside in case the installation
  is using a proxy. The issue occurs at least via ha-proxy, as it can be tricked to
  using relative/non-normalized paths to access the /admin application path relative
  to /realms which is expected to be exposed."
