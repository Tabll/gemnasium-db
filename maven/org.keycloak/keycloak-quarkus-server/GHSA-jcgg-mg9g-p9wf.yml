title: "Duplicate Advisory: Keycloak Build Process Exposes Sensitive Data"
description: "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-v7gv-xpgf-6395. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n## Original Description\nA flaw was found in Keycloak. This issue
  occurs because sensitive runtime values, such as passwords, may be captured during
  the Keycloak build process and embedded as default values in bytecode, leading to
  unintended information disclosure. In Keycloak 26, sensitive data specified directly
  in environment variables during the build process is also stored as a default values,
  making it accessible during runtime. Indirect usage of environment variables for
  SPI options and Quarkus properties is also vulnerable due to unconditional expansion
  by PropertyMapper logic, capturing sensitive data as default values in all Keycloak
  versions up to 26.0.2."
