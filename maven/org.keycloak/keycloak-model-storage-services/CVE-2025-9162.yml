package_slug: "maven/org.keycloak/keycloak-model-storage-services"
title: "Keycloak Potential Variable Reference in Model Storage Services"
description: "A flaw was found in org.keycloak/keycloak-model-storage-service. The
  `KeycloakRealmImport` custom resource substitutes placeholders within imported realm
  documents, potentially referencing environment variables. This substitution process
  allows for injection attacks when crafted realm documents are processed. An attacker
  can leverage this to inject malicious content during the realm import procedure.
  This can lead to unintended consequences within the Keycloak environment."
