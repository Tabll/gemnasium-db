description: "A flaw was found in org.keycloak/keycloak-model-storage-service. The
  KeycloakRealmImport custom resource substitutes placeholders within imported realm
  documents, potentially referencing environment variables. This substitution process\nallows
  for injection attacks when crafted realm documents are processed. An attacker can
  leverage this to inject malicious content during the realm import procedure. This
  can lead to unintended consequences within the Keycloak environment."
