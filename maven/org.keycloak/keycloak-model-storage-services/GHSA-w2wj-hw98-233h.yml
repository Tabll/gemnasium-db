  Services"
description: "### Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it
  is a duplicate of GHSA-8hxp-qmph-w5gq. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n### Original Description\n\nA flaw was found in org.keycloak/keycloak-model-storage-service.
  The KeycloakRealmImport custom resource substitutes placeholders within imported
  realm documents, potentially referencing environment variables. This substitution
  process\nallows for injection attacks when crafted realm documents are processed.
  An attacker can leverage this to inject malicious content during the realm import
  procedure. This can lead to unintended consequences within the Keycloak environment."
