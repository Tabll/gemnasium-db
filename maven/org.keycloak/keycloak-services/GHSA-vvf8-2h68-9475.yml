title: "Duplicate Advisory: Keycloak Open Redirect vulnerability"
description: "# Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-w8gr-xwp4-r9f7. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n# Original Description\nA misconfiguration flaw was found in Keycloak.
  This issue can allow an attacker to redirect users to an arbitrary URL if a 'Valid
  Redirect URI' is set to http://localhost or http://127.0.0.1, enabling sensitive
  information such as authorization codes to be exposed to the attacker, potentially
  leading to session hijacking."
