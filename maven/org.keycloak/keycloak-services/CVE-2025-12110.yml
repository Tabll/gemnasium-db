title: "Keycloak does not invalidate offline sessions when the offline_access scope
  is removed"
description: "A flaw was found in Keycloak. An offline session continues to be valid
  when the offline_access scope is removed from the client. The refresh token is accepted
  and you can continue to request new tokens for the session. As it can lead to a
  situation where an administrator removes the scope, and assumes that offline sessions
  are no longer available, but they are."
