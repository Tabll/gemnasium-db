title: "Keycloak vulnerable to session takeovers due to reuse of session identifiers"
description: "A flaw was found in Keycloak. In Keycloak where a user can accidentally
  get access to another user's session if both use the same device and browser. This
  happens because Keycloak sometimes reuses session identifiers and doesn’t clean
  up properly during logout when browser cookies are missing. As a result, one user
  may receive tokens that belong to another user."
