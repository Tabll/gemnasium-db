title: "Duplicate Advisory: Keycloak has a brute force login protection bypass"
description: "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-gc7q-jgjv-vjr2. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n## Original Description\nA vulnerability was found in Keycloak. This
  flaw allows attackers to bypass brute force protection by exploiting the timing
  of login attempts. By initiating multiple login requests simultaneously, attackers
  can exceed the configured limits for failed attempts before the system locks them
  out. This timing loophole enables attackers to make more guesses at passwords than
  intended, potentially compromising account security on affected systems."
