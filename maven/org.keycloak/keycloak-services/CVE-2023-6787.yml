package_slug: "maven/org.keycloak/keycloak-services"
title: "Keycloak vulnerable to session hijacking via re-authentication"
description: "A flaw was found in Keycloak. An active keycloak session can be hijacked
  by initiating a new authentication (having the query parameter prompt=login) and
  forcing the user to enter his credentials once again. If the user cancels this re-authentication
  by clicking Restart login, the account takeover could take place as the new session,
  with a different SUB, will have the same SID as the previous session."
