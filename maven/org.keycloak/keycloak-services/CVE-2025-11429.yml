package_slug: "maven/org.keycloak/keycloak-services"
title: "Keycloak does not invalidate sessions when \"Remember Me\" is disabled"
description: "A flaw was found in Keycloak. Keycloak does not immediately enforce
  the disabling of the \"Remember Me\" realm setting on existing user sessions. Sessions
  created while \"Remember Me\" was active retain their extended session lifetime
  until they expire, overriding the administrator's recent security configuration
  change. This is a logic flaw in session management increases the potential window
  for successful session hijacking or unauthorized long-term access persistence. The
  flaw lies in the session expiration logic relying on the session-local \"remember-me\"
  flag without validating the current realm-level configuration."
