title: "Keycloak phishing attack via email verification step in first login flow"
description: "There is a flaw with the first login flow where, during a IdP login,
  an attacker with a registered account can initiate the process to merge accounts
  with an existing victim's account. The attacker will subsequently be prompted to
  \"review profile\" information, which allows the the attacker to modify their email
  address to that of a victim's account. This triggers a verification email sent to
  the victim's email address. If the victim clicks the verification link, the attacker
  can gain access to the victim's account. While not a zero-interaction attack, the
  attacker's email address is not directly present in the verification email content,
  making it a potential phishing opportunity.\n\nThis issue has been fixed in versions
  26.0.13, 26.2.6, and 26.3.0."
