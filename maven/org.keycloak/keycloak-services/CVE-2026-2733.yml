package_slug: "maven/org.keycloak/keycloak-services"
title: "Keycloak: Missing Check on Disabled Client for Docker Registry Protocol"
description: "A flaw was identified in the Docker v2 authentication endpoint of Keycloak,
  where tokens continue to be issued even after a Docker registry client has been
  administratively disabled. This means that turning the client “Enabled” setting
  to OFF does not fully prevent access. As a result, previously valid credentials
  can still be used to obtain authentication tokens. This weakens administrative controls
  and could allow unintended access to container registry resources."
