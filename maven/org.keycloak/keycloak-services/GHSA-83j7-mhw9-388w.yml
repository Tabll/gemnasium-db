title: "Duplicate Advisory: Keycloak Privilege Escalation Vulnerability in Admin Console
  (FGAPv2 Enabled)"
description: "### Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it
  is a duplicate of GHSA-27gp-8389-hm4w. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n### Original Description\nA flaw was found in the Keycloak identity
  and access management system when Fine-Grained Admin Permissions (FGAPv2) are enabled.
  An administrative user with the manage-users role can escalate their privileges
  to realm-admin due to improper privilege enforcement. This vulnerability allows
  unauthorized elevation of access rights, compromising the intended separation of
  administrative duties and posing a security risk to the realm."
