title: "Keycloak allows Incorrect Assignment of an Organization to a User"
description: "A flaw was found in the Keycloak organization feature, which allows
  the incorrect assignment of an organization to a user if their username or email
  matches the organizationâ€™s domain pattern. This issue occurs at the mapper level,
  leading to misrepresentation in tokens. If an application relies on these claims
  for authorization, it may incorrectly assume a user belongs to an organization they
  are not a member of, potentially granting unauthorized access or privileges."
