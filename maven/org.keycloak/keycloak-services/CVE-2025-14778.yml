title: "Keycloak Affected by Broken Access Control Vulnerability in the UserManagedPermissionService"
description: "A flaw was found in Keycloak. A significant Broken Access Control vulnerability
  exists in the UserManagedPermissionService (UMA Protection API). When updating or
  deleting a UMA policy associated with multiple resources, the authorization check
  only verifies the caller's ownership against the first resource in the policy's
  list. This allows a user (Owner A) who owns one resource (RA) to update a shared
  policy and modify authorization rules for other resources (e.g., RB) in that same
  policy, even if those other resources are owned by a different user (Owner B). This
  constitutes a horizontal privilege escalation."
