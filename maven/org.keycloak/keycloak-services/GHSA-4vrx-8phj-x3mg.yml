  a duplicate of GHSA-69fp-7c8p-crjr. This link is maintained to preserve external

  Pushed Authorization Requests (PAR). Client-provided parameters were found to be
  included in plain text in the KC_RESTART cookie returned by the authorization server's
  HTTP response to a `request_uri` authorization request, possibly leading to an information
  disclosure vulnerability."
