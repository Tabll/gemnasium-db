title: "Keycloak Denial of Service (DoS) Vulnerability via JWT Token Cache"
description: "A flaw was found in Keycloak. When the configuration uses JWT tokens
  for authentication, the tokens are cached until expiration. If a client uses JWT
  tokens with an excessively long expiration time, for example, 24 or 48 hours, the
  cache can grow indefinitely, leading to an OutOfMemoryError. This issue could result
  in a denial of service condition, preventing legitimate users from accessing the
  system."
