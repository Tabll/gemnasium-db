title: "Vulnerable Redirect URI Validation Results in Open Redirect"
description: "A misconfiguration flaw was found in Keycloak. This issue can allow
  an attacker to redirect users to an arbitrary URL if a 'Valid Redirect URI' is set
  to http://localhost/ or http://127.0.0.1/, enabling sensitive information such as
  authorization codes to be exposed to the attacker, potentially leading to session
  hijacking."
