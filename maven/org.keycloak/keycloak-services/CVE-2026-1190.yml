title: "Keycloak's missing timestamp validation allows attackers to extend SAML response
  validity periods"
description: "A flaw was found in Keycloak's SAML brokering functionality. When Keycloak
  is configured as a client in a Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) setup,
  it fails to validate the `NotOnOrAfter` timestamp within the `SubjectConfirmationData`.
  This allows an attacker to delay the expiration of SAML responses, potentially extending
  the time a response is considered valid and leading to unexpected session durations
  or resource consumption."
