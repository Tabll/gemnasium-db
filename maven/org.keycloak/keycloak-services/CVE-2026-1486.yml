title: "Keycloak fails to verify if an Identity Provider (IdP) is enabled before issuing
  tokens"
description: "A flaw was found in Keycloak. A vulnerability exists in the jwt-authorization-grant
  flow where the server fails to verify if an Identity Provider (IdP) is enabled before
  issuing tokens. The issuer lookup mechanism (lookupIdentityProviderFromIssuer) retrieves
  the IdP configuration but does not filter for isEnabled=false. If an administrator
  disables an IdP (e.g., due to a compromise or offboarding), an entity possessing
  that IdP's signing key can still generate valid JWT assertions that Keycloak accepts,
  resulting in the issuance of valid access tokens."
