package_slug: "maven/org.keycloak/keycloak-services"
title: "Keycloak Services has a potential bypass of brute force protection"
description: "If an attacker launches many login attempts in parallel then the attacker
  can have more guesses at a password than the brute force protection configuration
  permits. This is due to the brute force check occurring before the brute force protector
  has locked the user.\n\n**Acknowledgements:**\nSpecial thanks to Maurizio Agazzini
  for reporting this issue and helping us improve our project."
