title: "Keycloak-services SMTP Inject Vulnerability"
description: "A vulnerability was found in Keycloak-services. Special characters used
  during e-mail registration may perform SMTP Injection and unexpectedly send short
  unwanted e-mails. The email is limited to 64 characters (limited local part of the
  email), so the attack is limited to very shorts emails (subject and little data,
  the example is 60 chars). This flaw's only direct consequence is an unsolicited
  email being sent from the Keycloak server. However, this action could be a precursor
  for more sophisticated attacks."
