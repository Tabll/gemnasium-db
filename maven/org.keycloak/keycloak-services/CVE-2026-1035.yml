package_slug: "maven/org.keycloak/keycloak-services"
title: "Keycloak does not validate and update refresh token usage atomically"
description: "A flaw was found in the Keycloak server during refresh token processing,
  specifically in the TokenManager class responsible for enforcing refresh token reuse
  policies. When strict refresh token rotation is enabled, the validation and update
  of refresh token usage are not performed atomically. This allows concurrent refresh
  requests to bypass single-use enforcement and issue multiple access tokens from
  the same refresh token. As a result, Keycloak’s refresh token rotation hardening
  can be undermined."
