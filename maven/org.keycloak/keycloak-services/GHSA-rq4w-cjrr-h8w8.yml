title: "Duplicate Advisory: Keycloak allows Incorrect Assignment of an Organization
  to a User"
description: "# Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-gvgg-2r3r-53x7. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n# Original Description\nA flaw was found in the Keycloak organization
  feature, which allows the incorrect assignment of an organization to a user if their
  username or email matches the organizationâ€™s domain pattern. This issue occurs at
  the mapper level, leading to misrepresentation in tokens. If an application relies
  on these claims for authorization, it may incorrectly assume a user belongs to an
  organization they are not a member of, potentially granting unauthorized access
  or privileges."
