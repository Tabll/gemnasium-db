title: "Duplicate Advisory: Keycloak error_description injection on error pages that
  can trigger phishing attacks"
description: "### Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it
  is a duplicate of GHSA-27gc-wj6x-9w55. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n### Original Description\nA flaw was found in Keycloak. Keycloakâ€™s
  account console and other pages accept arbitrary text in the error_description query
  parameter. This text is directly rendered in error pages without validation or sanitization.
  While HTML encoding prevents XSS, an attacker can craft URLs with misleading messages
  (e.g., fake support phone numbers or URLs), which are displayed within the trusted
  Keycloak UI. This creates a phishing vector, potentially tricking users into contacting
  malicious actors."
