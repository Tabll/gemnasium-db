title: " Keycloak’s OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration feature affected by
  Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
description: "A flaw was identified in Keycloak’s OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration
  feature when clients authenticate using private_key_jwt. The issue allows a client
  to specify an arbitrary jwks_uri, which Keycloak then retrieves without validating
  the destination. This enables attackers to coerce the Keycloak server into making
  HTTP requests to internal or restricted network resources. As a result, attackers
  can probe internal services and cloud metadata endpoints, creating an information
  disclosure and reconnaissance risk."
