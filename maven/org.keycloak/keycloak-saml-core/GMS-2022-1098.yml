title: "ECP SAML binding bypasses authentication flows"
description: "### Description\nA flaw was found in keycloak, where the default ECP
  binding flow allows other authentication flows to be bypassed. By exploiting this
  behavior, an attacker can bypass the MFA authentication by sending a SOAP request
  with an AuthnRequest and Authorization header with the user's credentials. The highest
  threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and integrity.\n"
