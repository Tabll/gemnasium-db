title: "Improper Verification of SAML Responses Leading to Privilege Escalation in
  Keycloak"
description: "A flaw exists in the SAML signature validation method within the Keycloak
  XMLSignatureUtil class. The method incorrectly determines whether a SAML signature
  is for the full document or only for specific assertions based on the position of
  the signature in the XML document, rather than the Reference element used to specify
  the signed element. This flaw allows attackers to create crafted responses that
  can bypass the validation, potentially leading to privilege escalation or impersonation
  attacks."
