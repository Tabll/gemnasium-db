package_slug: "maven/org.keycloak/keycloak-quarkus-dist"
title: "Keycloak has debug default bind address"
description: "A vulnerability exists in Keycloak's server distribution where enabling
  debug mode (`--debug`) insecurely defaults to binding the Java Debug Wire Protocol
  (JDWP) port to all network interfaces (`0.0.0.0`). This exposes the debug port to
  the local network, allowing an attacker on the same network segment to attach a
  remote debugger and achieve remote code execution within the Keycloak Java virtual
  machine.\n\nRed Hat evaluates this as a Moderate impact vulnerability due to the
  requirement of running debug mode and untrusted network. Also, for Red Hat Single
  Sign-On, this must as well be bound to 0.0.0.0 address, which is not recommended
  in production scenarios."
