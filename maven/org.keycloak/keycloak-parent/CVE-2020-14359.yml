title: "Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness"
description: "A vulnerability was found in all versions of keycloak, where on using
  lower case HTTP headers (via cURL) we can bypass our Gatekeeper. Lower case headers
  are also accepted by some webservers (e.g. Jetty). This means there is no protection
  when we put a Gatekeeper in front of a Jetty server and use lowercase headers."
