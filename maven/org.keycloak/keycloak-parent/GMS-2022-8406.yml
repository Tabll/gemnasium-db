title: "Keycloak vulnerable to session takeover with OIDC offline refreshtokens"
description: "An issue was discovered in Keycloak when using a client with the `offline_access`
  scope. Reuse of session ids across root and user authentication sessions and a lack
  of root session validation enabled attackers to resolve a user session attached
  to a different previously authenticated user.\n\nThis issue most affects users of
  shared computers. Suppose a user logs out of their account (without clearing their
  cookies) in a mobile app or similar client that includes the `offline_access` scope,
  and another user authenticates to the application. In that case, it will share the
  same root session id, and when utilizing the refresh token, they will be issued
  a token for the original user."
