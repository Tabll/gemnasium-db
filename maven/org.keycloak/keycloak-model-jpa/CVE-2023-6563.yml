title: "Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling"
description: "An unconstrained memory consumption vulnerability was discovered in
  Keycloak. It can be triggered in environments which have millions of offline tokens
  (> 500,000 users with each having at least 2 saved sessions). If an attacker creates
  two or more user sessions and then open the \"consents\" tab of the admin User Interface,
  the UI attempts to load a huge number of offline client sessions leading to excessive
  memory and CPU consumption which could potentially crash the entire system."
