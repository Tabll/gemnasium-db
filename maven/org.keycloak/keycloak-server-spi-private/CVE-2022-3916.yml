package_slug: "maven/org.keycloak/keycloak-server-spi-private"
title: "Insufficient Session Expiration"
description: "A flaw was found in the offline_access scope in Keycloak. This issue
  would affect users of shared computers more (especially if cookies are not cleared),
  due to a lack of root session validation, and the reuse of session ids across root
  and user authentication sessions. This enables an attacker to resolve a user session
  attached to a previously authenticated user; when utilizing the refresh token, they
  will be issued a token for the original user."
