package_slug: "maven/org.keycloak/keycloak-core"
title: "Improper Certificate Validation"
description: "A vulnerability was found in keycloak before 6.0.2. The X.509 authenticator
  supports the verification of client certificates through the CRL, where the CRL
  list can be obtained from the URL provided in the certificate itself (CDP) or through
  the separately configured path. The CRL are often available over the network through
  unsecured protocols ('http' or 'ldap') and hence the caller should verify the signature
  and possibly the certification path. Keycloak currently doesn't validate signatures
  on CRL, which can result in a possibility of various attacks like man-in-the-middle."
