description: "It was found that while parsing the SAML messages the StaxParserUtil
  class of keycloak before 2.5.1 replaces special strings for obtaining attribute
  values with system property. This could allow an attacker to determine values of
  system properties at the attacked system by formatting the SAML request ID field
  to be the chosen system property which could be obtained in the \"InResponseTo\"
  field in the response."
