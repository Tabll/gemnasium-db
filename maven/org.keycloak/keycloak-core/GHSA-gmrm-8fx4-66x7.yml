title: "Duplicate Advisory: Keycloak: Leak of configured LDAP bind credentials"
description: "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-c25h-c27q-5qpv. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n## Original Description\n\nA vulnerability was found in Keycloak.
  The LDAP testing endpoint allows changing the Connection URL  independently without
  re-entering the currently configured LDAP bind credentials. This flaw allows an
  attacker with admin access (permission manage-realm) to change the LDAP host URL
  (\"Connection URL\") to a machine they control. The Keycloak server will connect
  to the attacker's host and try to authenticate with the configured credentials,
  thus leaking them to the attacker. As a consequence, an attacker who has compromised
  the admin console or compromised a user with sufficient privileges can leak domain
  credentials and attack the domain."
