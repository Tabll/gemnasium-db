identifier: "CVE-2020-1728"
package_slug: "maven/org.keycloak/keycloak-core"
title: "Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames"
description: "A vulnerability was found in Keycloak where the pages on the Admin Console
  area of the application are completely missing general HTTP security headers in
  HTTP-responses. This does not directly lead to a security issue, yet it might aid
  attackers in their efforts to exploit other problems. The flaws unnecessarily make
  the servers more prone to Clickjacking, channel downgrade attacks and other similar
  client-based attack vectors."
