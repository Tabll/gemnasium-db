title: "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature"
description: "It was found that Keycloak's SAML broker, versions up to 6.0.1, did
  not verify missing message signatures. If an attacker modifies the SAML Response
  and removes the <Signature> sections, the message is still accepted, and the message
  can be modified. An attacker could use this flaw to impersonate other users and
  gain access to sensitive information."
