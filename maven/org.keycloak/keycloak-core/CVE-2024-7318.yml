package_slug: "maven/org.keycloak/keycloak-core"
title: "Keycloak Uses a Key Past its Expiration Date"
description: "A vulnerability was found in Keycloak. Expired OTP codes are still usable
  when using FreeOTP when the OTP token period is set to 30 seconds (default). Instead
  of expiring and deemed unusable around 30 seconds in, the tokens are valid for an
  additional 30 seconds totaling 1 minute.\nA one time passcode that is valid longer
  than its expiration time increases the attack window for malicious actors to abuse
  the system and compromise accounts. Additionally, it increases the attack surface
  because at any given time, two OTPs are valid."
