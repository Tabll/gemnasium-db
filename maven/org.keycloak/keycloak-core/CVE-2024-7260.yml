title: "Keycloak Open Redirect vulnerability"
description: "An open redirect vulnerability was found in Keycloak. A specially crafted
  URL can be constructed where the `referrer` and `referrer_uri` parameters are made
  to trick a user to visit a malicious webpage. A trusted URL can trick users and
  automation into believing that the URL is safe, when, in fact, it redirects to a
  malicious server. This issue can result in a victim inadvertently trusting the destination
  of the redirect, potentially leading to a successful phishing attack or other types
  of attacks.\n\nOnce a crafted URL is made, it can be sent to a Keycloak admin via
  email for example. This will trigger this vulnerability when the user visits the
  page and clicks the link. A malicious actor can use this to target users they know
  are Keycloak admins for further attacks. It may also be possible to bypass other
  domain-related security checks, such as supplying this as a OAuth redirect uri.
  The malicious actor can further obfuscate the `redirect_uri` using URL encoding,
  to hide the text of the actual malicious website domain."
