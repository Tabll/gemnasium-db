package_slug: "maven/org.keycloak/keycloak-account-ui"
title: "Keycloak error_description injection on error pages that can trigger phishing
  attacks"
description: "Keycloakâ€™s account console accepts arbitrary text in the `error_description`
  query parameter. This text is directly rendered in error pages without validation
  or sanitization. While HTML encoding prevents XSS, an attacker can craft URLs with
  misleading messages (e.g., fake support phone numbers or URLs), which are displayed
  within the trusted Keycloak UI. This creates a phishing vector, potentially tricking
  users into contacting malicious actors."
