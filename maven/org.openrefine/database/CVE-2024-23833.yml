title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "OpenRefine is a free, open source power tool for working with messy
  data and improving it. A jdbc attack vulnerability exists in OpenRefine(version<=3.7.7)
  where an attacker may construct a JDBC query which may read files on the host filesystem.
  Due to the newer MySQL driver library in the latest version of OpenRefine (8.0.30),
  there is no associated deserialization utilization point, so original code execution
  cannot be achieved, but attackers can use this vulnerability to read sensitive files
  on the target server. This issue has been addressed in version 3.7.8. Users are
  advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
