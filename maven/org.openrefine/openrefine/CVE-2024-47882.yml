package_slug: "maven/org.openrefine/openrefine"
title: "OpenRefine's error page lacks escaping, leading to potential Cross-site Scripting
  on import of malicious project"
description: "The built-in \"Something went wrong!\" error page includes the exception
  message and exception traceback without escaping HTML tags, enabling injection into
  the page if an attacker can reliably produce an error with an attacker-influenced
  message.\n\nIt appears that the only way to reach this code in OpenRefine itself
  is for an attacker to somehow convince a victim to import a malicious file, as in
  GHSA-m88m-crr9-jvqq, which may be difficult.  However, out-of-tree extensions may
  add their own calls to `respondWithErrorPage`."
