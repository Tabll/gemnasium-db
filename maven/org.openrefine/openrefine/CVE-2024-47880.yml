package_slug: "maven/org.openrefine/openrefine"
title: "OpenRefine has a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability (XSS) from POST
  request in ExportRowsCommand"
description: "The `export-rows` command can be used in such a way that it reflects
  part of the request verbatim, with a Content-Type header also taken from the request.\n\nAn
  attacker could lead a user to a malicious page that submits a form POST that contains
  \ embedded JavaScript code. This code would then be included in the response, along
  with an attacker-controlled `Content-Type` header, and so potentially executed in
  the victim's browser as if it was part of OpenRefine.\n\nThe attacker must know
  a valid project ID of a project that contains at least one row."
