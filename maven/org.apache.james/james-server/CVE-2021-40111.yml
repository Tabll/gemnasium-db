title: "Infinite Loop in Apache James"
description: "In Apache James, while fuzzing with Jazzer the IMAP parsing stack, we
  discover that crafted APPEND and STATUS IMAP command could be used to trigger infinite
  loops resulting in expensive CPU computations and OutOfMemory exceptions. This can
  be used for a Denial Of Service attack. The IMAP user needs to be authenticated
  to exploit this vulnerability. This affected Apache James prior to version 3.6.1.
  This vulnerability had been patched in Apache James 3.6.1 and higher. We recommend
  the upgrade."
