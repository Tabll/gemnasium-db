title: "Apache James server: Privilege escalation via JMX pre-authentication deserialization"
description: "Apache James prior to version 3.7.5 and 3.8.0 exposes a JMX endpoint
  on localhost subject to pre-authentication deserialisation of untrusted data.\nGiven
  a deserialisation gadjet, this could be leveraged as part of an exploit chain that
  could result in privilege escalation.\nNote that by default JMX endpoint is only
  bound locally.\n\nWe recommend users to:\n - Upgrade to a non-vulnerable Apache
  James version\n\n - Run Apache James isolated from other processes (docker - dedicated
  virtual machine)\n - If possible turn off JMX\n\n"
