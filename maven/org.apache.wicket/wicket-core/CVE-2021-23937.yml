description: "A DNS proxy and possible amplification attack vulnerability in WebClientInfo
  of Apache Wicket allows an attacker to trigger arbitrary DNS lookups from the server
  when the X-Forwarded-For header is not properly sanitized. This DNS lookup can be
  engineered to overload an internal DNS server or to slow down request processing
  of the Apache Wicket application causing a possible denial of service on either
  the internal infrastructure or the web application itself. This issue affects Apache
  Wicket Apache Wicket and prior versions; Apache Wicket and prior versions; Apache
  Wicket and prior versions and Apache Wicket versions."
