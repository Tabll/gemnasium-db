title: "Apache Wicket vulnerable to CSRF attacks"
description: "Apache Wicket 6.x before 6.25.0, 7.x before 7.5.0, and 8.0.0-M1 provide
  a CSRF prevention measure that fails to discover some cross origin requests. The
  mitigation is to not only check the Origin HTTP header, but also take the Referer
  HTTP header into account when no Origin was provided. Furthermore, not all Wicket
  server side targets were subjected to the CSRF check. This was also fixed."
