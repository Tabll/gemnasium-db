title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** In the default configuration of Apache
  SOAP, an RPCRouterServlet is available without authentication. This gives an attacker
  the possibility to invoke methods on the classpath that meet certain criteria. Depending
  on what classes are available on the classpath this might even lead to arbitrary
  remote code execution. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no
  longer supported by the maintainer."
