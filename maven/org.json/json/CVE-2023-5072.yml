title: "Java: DoS Vulnerability in JSON-JAVA"
description: "A denial of service vulnerability in JSON-Java was discovered by [ClusterFuzz](https://google.github.io/clusterfuzz/).
  \ A bug in the parser means that an input string of modest size can lead to indefinite
  amounts of memory being used. There are two issues: (1) the parser bug can be used
  to circumvent a check that is supposed to prevent the key in a JSON object from
  itself being another JSON object; (2) if a key does end up being a JSON object then
  it gets converted into a string, using `\\` to escape special characters, including
  `\\` itself. So by nesting JSON objects, with a key that is a JSON object that has
  a key that is a JSON object, and so on, we can get an exponential number of `\\`
  characters in the escaped string."
