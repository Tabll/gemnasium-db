title: "hippo4j Includes Hard Coded Secret Key in JWT Creation"
description: "hippo4j 1.0.0 to 1.5.0, uses a hard-coded secret key in its JWT (JSON
  Web Token) creation. This allows attackers with access to the source code or compiled
  binary to forge valid access tokens and impersonate any user, including privileged
  ones such as \"admin\". The vulnerability poses a critical security risk in systems
  where authentication and authorization rely on the integrity of JWTs."
