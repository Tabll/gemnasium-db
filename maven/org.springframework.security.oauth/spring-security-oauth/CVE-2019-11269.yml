package_slug: "maven/org.springframework.security.oauth/spring-security-oauth"
title: "URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')"
description: "Spring Security OAuth versions 2.3 prior to 2.3.6, 2.2 prior to 2.2.5,
  2.1 prior to 2.1.5, and 2.0 prior to 2.0.18, as well as older unsupported versions
  could be susceptible to an open redirector attack that can leak an authorization
  code. A malicious user or attacker can craft a request to the authorization endpoint
  using the authorization code grant type, and specify a manipulated redirection URI
  via the redirect_uri parameter. This can cause the authorization server to redirect
  the resource owner user-agent to a URI under the control of the attacker with the
  leaked authorization code."
