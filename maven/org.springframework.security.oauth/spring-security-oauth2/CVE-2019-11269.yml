identifier: "CVE-2019-11269"
package_slug: "maven/org.springframework.security.oauth/spring-security-oauth2"
title: "URL Redirection to Untrusted Site (Open Redirect)"
description: "Spring Security OAuth could be susceptible to an open redirector attack
  that can leak an authorization code. A malicious user or attacker can craft a request
  to the authorization endpoint using the authorization code grant type, and specify
  a manipulated redirection URI via the `redirect_uri` parameter. This can cause the
  authorization server to redirect the resource owner user-agent to a URI under the
  control of the attacker with the leaked authorization code."
