identifier: "CVE-2019-3778"
package_slug: "maven/org.springframework.security.oauth/spring-security-oauth2"
title: "URL Redirection to Untrusted Site"
description: "Spring Security OAuth could be susceptible to an open redirector attack
  that can leak an authorization code. A malicious user or attacker can craft a request
  to the authorization endpoint using the authorization code grant type, and specify
  a manipulated redirection URI via the `redirect_uri` parameter. This can cause the
  authorization server to redirect the resource owner user-agent to a URI under the
  control of the attacker with the leaked authorization code. This vulnerability exposes
  applications that meet all of the following requirements: Act in the role of an
  Authorization Server (e.g. `@EnableAuthorizationServer`) and uses the `DefaultRedirectResolver`
  in the `AuthorizationEndpoint`. This vulnerability does not expose applications
  that: Act in the role of an Authorization Server and uses a different `RedirectResolver`
  implementation other than DefaultRedirectResolver, act in the role of a Resource
  Server only (e.g. `@EnableResourceServer`), act in the role of a Client only (e.g.
  `@EnableOAuthClient`)."
