package_slug: "maven/org.springframework/spring-webmvc"
title: "Path Traversal"
description: "Spring Framework allows applications to configure Spring MVC to serve
  static resources (e.g., CSS, JS, images). When static resources are served from
  a file system on Windows (as opposed to the classpath, or the `ServletContext`),
  a malicious user can send a request using a specially crafted URL that can lead
  a directory traversal attack."
