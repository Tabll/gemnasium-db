title: "Path traversal vulnerability in functional web frameworks"
description: "Applications serving static resources through the functional web frameworks
  WebMvc.fn or WebFlux.fn are vulnerable to path traversal attacks. An attacker can
  craft malicious HTTP requests and obtain any file on the file system that is also
  accessible to the process in which the Spring application is running.\n\nSpecifically,
  an application is vulnerable when both of the following are true:\n\n*  the web
  application uses RouterFunctions to serve static resources\n*  resource handling
  is explicitly configured with a FileSystemResource location\n\n\nHowever, malicious
  requests are blocked and rejected when any of the following is true:\n\n*  the  Spring
  Security HTTP Firewall https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/exploits/firewall.html
   is in use\n*  the application runs on Tomcat or Jetty"
