title: "Spring Framework vulnerable to denial of service"
description: "In Spring Framework versions 6.0.0 - 6.0.13, it is possible for a user
  to provide specially crafted HTTP requests that may cause a denial-of-service (DoS)
  condition.\n\nSpecifically, an application is vulnerable when all of the following
  are true:\n\n*  the application uses Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux\n*  io.micrometer:micrometer-core is
  on the classpath\n*  an ObservationRegistry is configured in the application to
  record observations\n\n\nTypically, Spring Boot applications need the org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-actuator dependency
  to meet all conditions."
