title: "Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference"
description: "The Spring OXM wrapper when using the JAXB marshaller, does not disable

  cause a denial of service, and conduct CSRF attacks via an XML external entity declaration
  in conjunction with an entity reference in a (1) DOMSource, (2) StAXSource, (3)
  SAXSource, or (4) StreamSource, aka an XML External Entity (XXE) issue."
