package_slug: "maven/org.springframework/spring-core"
title: "Moderate severity vulnerability that affects org.springframework:spring-core"
description: "Spring Framework, versions 5.0 prior to 5.0.5 and versions 4.3 prior
  to 4.3.15 and older unsupported versions, provide client-side support for multipart
  requests. When Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux server application (server A) receives
  input from a remote client, and then uses that input to make a multipart request
  to another server (server B), it can be exposed to an attack, where an extra multipart
  is inserted in the content of the request from server A, causing server B to use
  the wrong value for a part it expects. This could to lead privilege escalation,
  for example, if the part content represents a username or user roles."
