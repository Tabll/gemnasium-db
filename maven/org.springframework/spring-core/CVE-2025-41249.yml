title: "Spring Framework annotation detection mechanism may result in improper authorization"
description: "The Spring Framework annotation detection mechanism may not correctly
  resolve annotations on methods within type hierarchies with a parameterized super
  type with unbounded generics. This can be an issue if such annotations are used
  for authorization decisions.\n\nYour application may be affected by this if you
  are using Spring Security's @EnableMethodSecurity feature.\n\nYou are not affected
  by this if you are not using @EnableMethodSecurity or if you do not use security
  annotations on methods in generic superclasses or generic interfaces.\n\nThis CVE
  is published in conjunction with  CVE-2025-41248 https://spring.io/security/cve-2025-41248
