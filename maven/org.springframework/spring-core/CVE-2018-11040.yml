package_slug: "maven/org.springframework/spring-core"
title: "Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere"
description: "Spring Framework, versions 5.0.x prior to 5.0.7 and 4.3.x prior to 4.3.18
  and older unsupported versions, allows web applications to enable cross-domain requests
  via JSONP (JSON with Padding) through AbstractJsonpResponseBodyAdvice for REST controllers
  and MappingJackson2JsonView for browser requests. Both are not enabled by default
  in Spring Framework nor Spring Boot, however, when MappingJackson2JsonView is configured
  in an application, JSONP support is automatically ready to use through the \"jsonp\"
  and \"callback\" JSONP parameters, enabling cross-domain requests."
