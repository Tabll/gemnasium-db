title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "Spring Framework, versions 5.0 prior to 5.0.5 and versions 4.3 prior
  to 4.3.15 and older unsupported versions, allow applications to configure Spring
  MVC to serve static resources (e.g. CSS, JS, images). When static resources are
  served from a file system on Windows (as opposed to the classpath, or the ServletContext),
  a malicious user can send a request using a specially crafted URL that can lead
  a directory traversal attack."
