title: "Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity"
description: "In Spring Framework versions 5.3.0 - 5.3.18, 5.2.0 - 5.2.20, and older
  unsupported versions, the patterns for `disallowedFields` on a `DataBinder` are case
  sensitive which means a field is not effectively protected unless it is listed with
  both upper and lower case for the first character of the field, including upper
  and lower case for the first character of all nested fields within the property
  path."
