title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "Pivotal Spring Framework through 6.0.0 suffers from a potential remote
  code execution (RCE) issue if used for Java deserialization of untrusted data. Depending
  on how the library is implemented within a product, this issue may or not occur,
  and authentication may be required. NOTE: the vendor's position is that untrusted
  data is not an intended use case. The product's behavior will not be changed because
  some users rely on deserialization of trusted data."
