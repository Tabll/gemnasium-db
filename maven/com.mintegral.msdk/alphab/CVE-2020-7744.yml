package_slug: "maven/com.mintegral.msdk/alphab"
title: "Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information"
description: "This affects all versions of package com.mintegral.msdk:alphab. The
  Android SDK distributed by the company contains malicious functionality in this
  module that tracks: 1. Downloads from Google urls either within Google apps or via
  browser including file downloads, e-mail attachments and Google Docs links. 2. All
  apk downloads, either organic or not. Mintegral listens to download events in Android's
  download manager and detects if the downloaded file's url contains: a. google.com
  or comes from a Google app (the com.android.vending package) b. Ends with .apk for
  apk downloads In both cases, the module sends the captured data back to Mintegral's
  servers. Note that the malicious functionality keeps running even if the app is
  currently not in focus (running in the background)."
