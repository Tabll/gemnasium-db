title: "Apache Syncope's AES encryption stores hard-coded passwords in internal database"
description: "Apache Syncope can be configured to store the user password values in
  the internal database with AES encryption, though this is not the default option.\n\nWhen
  AES is configured, the default key value, hard-coded in the source code, is always
  used. This allows a malicious attacker, once obtained access to the internal database
  content, to reconstruct the original cleartext password values.\nThis is not affecting
  encrypted plain attributes, whose values are also stored using AES encryption.\n\nUsers
  are recommended to upgrade to version 3.0.15 / 4.0.3, which fix this issue."
