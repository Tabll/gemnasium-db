title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language
  Statement ('Expression Language Injection')"
description: "A Server-Side Template Injection was identified in Apache Syncope prior
  to 2.1.6 enabling attackers to inject arbitrary Java EL expressions, leading to
  an unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. Apache Syncope uses
  Java Bean Validation (JSR 380) custom constraint validators. When building custom
  constraint violation error messages, they support different types of interpolation,
  including Java EL expressions. Therefore, if an attacker can inject arbitrary data
  in the error message template being passed, they will be able to run arbitrary Java
  code."
