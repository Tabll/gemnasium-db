title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "Snowflake JDBC provides a JDBC type 4 driver that supports core functionality,
  allowing Java program to connect to Snowflake. Users of the Snowflake JDBC driver
  were vulnerable to a command injection vulnerability. An attacker could set up a
  malicious, publicly accessible server which responds to the SSO URL with an attack
  payload. If the attacker then tricked a user into visiting the maliciously crafted
  connection URL, the userâ€™s local machine would render the malicious payload, leading
  to a remote code execution. The vulnerability was patched on March 17, 2023 as part
  of Snowflake JDBC driver Version 3.13.29. All users should immediately upgrade the
  Snowflake JDBC driver to the latest version: 3.13.29."
