title: "Snowflake JDBC Driver client-side encryption key in DEBUG logs"
description: "### Issue\nSnowflake discovered and remediated a vulnerability in the
  Snowflake JDBC driver (“Driver”). When the logging level was set to DEBUG, the Driver
  would log locally the client-side encryption master key of the target stage during
  the execution of GET/PUT commands. This key by itself does not grant access to any
  sensitive data without additional access authorizations,  and is not logged server-side
  by Snowflake.\n\nThis vulnerability affects Driver versions 3.0.13 through 3.23.0.
  Snowflake fixed the issue in version 3.23.1.\n\n### Vulnerability Details\nWhen
  the logging level was set to DEBUG, the Driver would locally log the client-side
  encryption master key of the target stage during the execution of GET/PUT commands.
  The key was logged in a JSON object under the queryStageMasterKey key. The key by
  itself does not grant access to any sensitive data.\n\n### Solution\nSnowflake released
  version 3.23.1 of the Snowflake JDBC driver, which fixes this issue. We highly recommend
  users upgrade to version 3.23.1.\n\n### Additional Information\nIf you discover
  a security vulnerability in one of our products or websites, please report the issue
  to Snowflake through our Vulnerability Disclosure Program hosted at HackerOne. For
  more information, please see our [Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://hackerone.com/snowflake?type=team)."
