title: "Snowflake JDBC uses insecure temporary credential cache file permissions"
description: "### Issue\nSnowflake discovered and remediated a vulnerability in the
  Snowflake JDBC Driver. On Linux systems, when temporary credential caching is enabled,
  the Snowflake JDBC Driver will cache temporary credentials locally in a world-readable
  file.\n\nThis vulnerability affects versions 3.6.8 through 3.21.0. Snowflake fixed
  the issue in version 3.22.0.\n\n### Vulnerability Details\nOn Linux, when either
  EXTERNALBROWSER or USERNAME_PASSWORD_MFA authentication methods are used with temporary
  credential caching enabled, the Snowflake JDBC Driver will cache temporary credentials
  in a local file. In the vulnerable versions of the Driver, this file is created
  with world-readable permissions.\n\n### Solution\nSnowflake released version 3.22.0
  of the Snowflake JDBC Driver, which fixes this issue. We recommend users upgrade
  to version 3.22.0.\n\n### Additional Information\nIf you discover a security vulnerability
  in one of our products or websites, please report the issue to HackerOne. For more
  information, please see our [Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://hackerone.com/snowflake?type=team)."
