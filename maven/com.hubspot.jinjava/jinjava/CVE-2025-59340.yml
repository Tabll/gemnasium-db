title: "jinjava has Sandbox Bypass via JavaType-Based Deserialization"
description: "jinjavaâ€™s current sandbox restrictions prevent direct access to dangerous
  methods such as `getClass()`, and block instantiation of Class objects. However,
  these protections can be bypassed.\n\nBy using mapper.getTypeFactory().constructFromCanonical(),
  it is possible to instruct the underlying ObjectMapper to deserialize attacker-controlled
  input into arbitrary classes. This enables the creation of semi-arbitrary class
  instances without directly invoking restricted methods or class literals.\n\nAs
  a result, an attacker can escape the sandbox and instantiate classes such as java.net.URL,
  opening up the ability to access local files and URLs(e.g., file:///etc/passwd).
  With further chaining, this primitive can potentially lead to remote code execution
  (RCE)."
