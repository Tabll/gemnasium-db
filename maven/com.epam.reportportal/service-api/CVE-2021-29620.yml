title: "Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference"
description: "Report portal is an open source reporting and analysis framework. Starting
  from of the service-api XML parsing was introduced. Unfortunately the XML parser

  Type Definition (DTD) file with external entities for extraction of secrets from
  Report Portal service-api module or server-side request forgery."
