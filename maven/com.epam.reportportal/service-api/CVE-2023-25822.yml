package_slug: "maven/com.epam.reportportal/service-api"
title: "Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling"
description: "ReportPortal is an AI-powered test automation platform. Prior to version
  5.10.0 of the `com.epam.reportportal:service-api` module, corresponding to ReportPortal
  version 23.2, the ReportPortal database becomes unstable and reporting almost fully
  stops except for small launches with approximately 1 test inside when the test_item.path
  field is exceeded the allowable `ltree` field type indexing limit (path length>=120,
  approximately recursive nesting of the nested steps). REINDEX INDEX path_gist_idx
  and path_idx aren't helped. The problem was fixed in `com.epam.reportportal:service-api`
  module version 5.10.0 (product release 23.2), where the maximum number of nested
  elements were programmatically limited. A workaround is available. After deletion
  of the data with long paths, and reindexing both indexes (path_gist_idx and path_idx),
  the database becomes stable and ReportPortal works properly."
