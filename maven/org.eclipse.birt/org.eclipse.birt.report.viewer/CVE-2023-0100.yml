package_slug: "maven/org.eclipse.birt/org.eclipse.birt.report.viewer"
title: "Improper Input Validation In Eclipse BIRT"
description: "In Eclipse BIRT, starting from version 2.6.2, the default configuration
  allowed to retrieve a report from the same host using an absolute HTTP path for
  the report parameter (e.g. __report=http://xyz.com/report.rptdesign). If the host
  indicated in the __report parameter matched the HTTP Host header value, the report
  would be retrieved. However, the Host header can be tampered with on some configurations
  where no virtual hosts are put in place (e.g. in the default configuration of Apache
  Tomcat) or when the default host points to the BIRT server. This vulnerability was
  patched on Eclipse BIRT 4.13."
