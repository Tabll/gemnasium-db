title: "Liferay Portal is vulnerable to XSS in the Blogs widget"
description: "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Blogs widget in Liferay

  92, 7.3 GA through update 36, and older unsupported versions allows remote attackers
  to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a crafted <iframe> injected into a blog
  entry's “Content” text field.\n\nThe Blogs widget in Liferay DXP does not add the
