  GA through update 92, 7.3 GA through update 35, and older unsupported versions does
  not properly obtain the remote address of the live site from the database which,
  which allows remote authenticated users to exfiltrate data to an attacker controlled
  server (i.e., a fake “live site”) via the _com_liferay_exportimport_web_portlet_ExportImportPortlet_remoteAddress
  and _com_liferay_exportimport_web_portlet_ExportImportPortlet_remotePort parameters.
  To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must also successfully obtain
  the staging server’s shared secret and add the attacker controlled server to the
  staging server’s trusted list."
