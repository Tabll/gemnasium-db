title: "JSONPath Plus Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerability"
description: "Versions of the package jsonpath-plus before 10.0.7 are vulnerable to
  Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to improper input sanitization. An attacker can
  execute aribitrary code on the system by exploiting the unsafe default usage of
  vm in Node.\n\n**Note:**\n\nThere was an attempt to fix it in version [10.0.0](https://github.com/JSONPath-Plus/JSONPath/commit/6b2f1b4c234292c75912b790bf7e2d7339d4ccd3)
  but it could still be exploited using [different payloads](https://github.com/JSONPath-Plus/JSONPath/issues/226)."
