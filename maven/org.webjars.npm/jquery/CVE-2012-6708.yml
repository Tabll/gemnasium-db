package_slug: "maven/org.webjars.npm/jquery"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "jQuery before 1.9.0 is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
  The jQuery(strInput) function does not differentiate selectors from HTML in a reliable
  fashion. In vulnerable versions, jQuery determined whether the input was HTML by
  looking for the '<' character anywhere in the string, giving attackers more flexibility
  when attempting to construct a malicious payload. In fixed versions, jQuery only
  deems the input to be HTML if it explicitly starts with the '<' character, limiting
  exploitability only to attackers who can control the beginning of a string, which
  is far less common."
