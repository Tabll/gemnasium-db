package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.contrib.changerequest/application-changerequest-default"
title: "Insufficiently Protected Credentials"
description: "XWiki Change Request is an XWiki application allowing to request changes
  on a wiki without publishing directly the changes. Change request allows to edit
  any page by default, and the changes are then exported in an XML file that anyone
  can download. So it's possible for an attacker to obtain password hash of users
  by performing an edit on the user profiles and then downloading the XML file that
  has been created. This is also true for any document that might contain password
  field and that a user can view.\nThis vulnerability impacts all version of Change
  Request, but the impact depends on the rights that has been set on the wiki since
  it requires for the user to have the Change request right (allowed by default) and
  view rights on the page to target. This issue cannot be easily exploited in an automated
  way. The patch consists in denying to users the right of editing pages that contains
  a password field with change request. It means that already existing change request
  for those pages won't be removed by the patch, administrators needs to take care
  of it. The patch is provided in Change Request 1.10, administrators should upgrade
  immediately. It's possible to workaround the vulnerability by denying manually the
  Change request right on some spaces, such as XWiki space which will include any
  user profile by default."
