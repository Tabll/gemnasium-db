  Form"
description: "Jenkins AsakusaSatellite Plugin 0.1.1 and earlier stores AsakusaSatellite
  API keys unencrypted in job config.xml files on the Jenkins controller as part of
  its configuration.\n\nThese API keys can be viewed by users with Item/Extended Read
  permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.\n\nAdditionally, the
  job configuration form does not mask these API keys, increasing the potential for

  is no fix."
