  Ozone 1.4.0 allows any authenticated Kerberos user to revoke and regenerate the
  S3 secrets of any other user. This is only possible if:\n*  ozone.s3g.secret.http.enabled
  is set to true. The default value of this configuration is false.\n*  The user configured
  in ozone.s3g.kerberos.principal is also configured in ozone.s3.administrators or

  1.4.1 which disables the affected endpoint."
