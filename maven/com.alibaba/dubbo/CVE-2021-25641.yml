package_slug: "maven/com.alibaba/dubbo"
title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "Each Apache Dubbo server will set a serialization id to tell the clients
  which serialization protocol it is working on. But for Dubbo versions before 2.7.8
  or 2.6.9, an attacker can choose which serialization id the Provider will use by
  tampering with the byte preamble flags, aka, not following the server's instruction.
  This means that if a weak deserializer such as the Kryo and FST are somehow in code
  scope (e.g. if Kryo is somehow a part of a dependency), a remote unauthenticated
  attacker can tell the Provider to use the weak deserializer, and then proceed to
  exploit it."
