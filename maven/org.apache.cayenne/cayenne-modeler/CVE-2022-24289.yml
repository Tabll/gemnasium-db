title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "Hessian serialization is a network protocol that supports object-based
  transmission. Apache Cayenne's optional Remote Object Persistence (ROP) feature
  is a web services-based technology that provides object persistence and query functionality
  to 'remote' applications. In Apache Cayenne 4.1, running on non-current patch versions
  of Java, an attacker with client access to Cayenne ROP can transmit a malicious
  payload to any vulnerable third-party dependency on the server. This can result
  in arbitrary code execution."
