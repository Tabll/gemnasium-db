title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "AntiSamy is a library for performing fast, configurable cleansing of
  HTML coming from untrusted sources. Prior to 1.7.5, there is a potential for a mutation
  XSS (mXSS) vulnerability in AntiSamy caused by flawed parsing of the HTML being
  sanitized. To be subject to this vulnerability the `preserveComments` directive
  must be enabled in your policy file. As a result, certain crafty inputs can result
  in elements in comment tags being interpreted as executable when using AntiSamy's
  sanitized output. Patched in AntiSamy 1.7.5 and later. "
