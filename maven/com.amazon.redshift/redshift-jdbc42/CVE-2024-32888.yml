title: "Amazon JDBC Driver for Redshift SQL Injection via line comment generation"
description: "SQL injection is possible when using the non-default connection property
  `preferQueryMode=simple` in combination with application code which has a vulnerable
  SQL that negates a parameter value.\n\nThere is no vulnerability in the driver when
  using the default, extended query mode. Note that `preferQueryMode` is not a supported
  parameter in Redshift JDBC driver, and is inherited code from Postgres JDBC driver.
  Users who do not override default settings to utilize this unsupported query mode
  are not affected."
