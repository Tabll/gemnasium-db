package_slug: "maven/org.typelevel/jawn-parser"
title: "Hash collision in typelevel jawn"
description: "Jawn is an open source JSON parser. Extenders of the `org.typelevel.jawn.SimpleFacade`
  and `org.typelevel.jawn.MutableFacade` who don't override `objectContext()` are
  vulnerable to a hash collision attack which may result in a denial of service. Most
  applications do not implement these traits directly, but inherit from a library.
  `jawn-parser-1.3.1` fixes this issue and users are advised to upgrade. For users
  unable to upgrade override `objectContext()` to use a collision-safe collection."
