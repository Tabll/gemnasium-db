title: "Grackle has StackOverflowError in GraphQL query processing"
description: "### Impact\n\nPrior to this fix, the GraphQL query parsing was vulnerable
  to `StackOverflowError`s. The possibility of small queries resulting in stack overflow
  is a potential denial of service vulnerability.\n\nThis potentially affects all
  applications using Grackle which have untrusted users.\n\n> [!CAUTION] \n> **No
  specific knowledge of an application's GraphQL schema would be required to construct
  a pathological query.**\n\n### Patches\nThe stack overflow issues have been resolved
  in the v0.18.0 release of Grackle.\n\n### Workarounds\nUsers could interpose a sanitizing
  layer in between untrusted input and Grackle query processing.\n"
