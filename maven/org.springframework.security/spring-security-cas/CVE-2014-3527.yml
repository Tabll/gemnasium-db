identifier: "CVE-2014-3527"
package_slug: "maven/org.springframework.security/spring-security-cas"
title: "Access control bypass via untrusted infomation usage in proxy ticket authentication"
description: "When using the CAS Proxy ticket authentication a malicious CAS Service
  could trick another CAS Service into authenticating a proxy ticket that was not
  associated. This is due to the fact that the proxy ticket authentication uses the
  information from the HttpServletRequest which is populated based upon untrusted
  information within the HTTP request. This means if there are access control restrictions
  on which CAS services can authenticate to one another, those restrictions can be
  bypassed. If users are not using CAS Proxy tickets and not basing access control
  decisions based upon the CAS Service, then there is no impact to users."
