title: "Spring Security authorization bypass for method security annotations on private
  methods"
description: "Spring Security Aspects may not correctly locate method security annotations
  on private methods. This can cause an authorization bypass.\n\nYour application
  may be affected by this if the following are true:\n\n*  You are using @EnableMethodSecurity(mode=ASPECTJ) and
  spring-security-aspects, and\n*  You have Spring Security method annotations on
  a private method\nIn that case, the target method may be able to be invoked without
  proper authorization.\n\nYou are not affected if:\n\n*  You are not using @EnableMethodSecurity(mode=ASPECTJ) or
  spring-security-aspects, or\n*  You have no Spring Security-annotated private methods"
