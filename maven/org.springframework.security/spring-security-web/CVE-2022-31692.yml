title: "Spring Security authorization rules can be bypassed via forward or include
  dispatcher types"
description: "Spring Security, versions 5.7 prior to 5.7.5 and 5.6 prior to 5.6.9
  could be susceptible to authorization rules bypass via forward or include dispatcher
  types. Specifically, an application is vulnerable when all of the following are
  true: The application expects that Spring Security applies security to forward and
  include dispatcher types. The application uses the AuthorizationFilter either manually
  or via the authorizeHttpRequests() method. The application configures the FilterChainProxy
  to apply to forward and/or include requests (e.g. spring.security.filter.dispatcher-types
  = request, error, async, forward, include). The application may forward or include
  the request to a higher privilege-secured endpoint. The application configures Spring
  Security to apply to every dispatcher type via authorizeHttpRequests().shouldFilterAllDispatcherTypes(true)"
