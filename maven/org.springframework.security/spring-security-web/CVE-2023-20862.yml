package_slug: "maven/org.springframework.security/spring-security-web"
title: "Incomplete Cleanup"
description: "In Spring Security, versions 5.7.x prior to 5.7.8, versions 5.8.x prior
  to 5.8.3, and versions 6.0.x prior to 6.0.3, the logout support does not properly
  clean the security context if using serialized versions. Additionally, it is not
  possible to explicitly save an empty security context to the HttpSessionSecurityContextRepository.
  This vulnerability can keep users authenticated even after they performed logout.
  Users of affected versions should apply the following mitigation. 5.7.x users should
  upgrade to 5.7.8. 5.8.x users should upgrade to 5.8.3. 6.0.x users should upgrade
  to 6.0.3."
