title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "Spring Framework 3.0.0 through 3.0.5, Spring Security 3.0.0 through
  3.0.5 and 2.0.0 through 2.0.6, and possibly other versions deserialize objects from
  untrusted sources, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended security restrictions
  and execute untrusted code by (1) serializing a java.lang.Proxy instance and using
  InvocationHandler, or (2) accessing internal AOP interfaces, as demonstrated using
  deserialization of a DefaultListableBeanFactory instance to execute arbitrary commands
  via the java.lang.Runtime class."
