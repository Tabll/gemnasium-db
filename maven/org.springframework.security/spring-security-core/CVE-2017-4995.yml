title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "When configured to enable default typing, Jackson contained a deserialization
  vulnerability that could lead to arbitrary code execution. which means that (through
  the previous exploit) arbitrary code could be executed if all of the following is
  true: (1) Spring Security's Jackson support is being leveraged by invoking `SecurityJackson2Modules.getModules(ClassLoader)`
  or `SecurityJackson2Modules.enableDefaultTyping(ObjectMapper);` (2) Jackson is used
  to deserialize data that is not trusted (Spring Security does not perform deserialization
  using Jackson, so this is an explicit choice of the user); and (3) there is an unknown
  (Jackson is not excluding it already) `deserialization gadget` that allows code
  execution present on the classpath. Jackson provides a exclusion approach to protecting
  against this type of attack, but Spring Security should be proactive against blocking
  unknown `deserialization gadgets` when Spring Security enables default typing."
