identifier: "CVE-2016-5007"
package_slug: "maven/org.springframework.security/spring-security-core"
title: "Improper Access Control"
description: "Spring Security relies on URL pattern mappings for authorization and
  for mapping requests to controllers respectively. Differences in the strictness
  of the pattern matching mechanisms, for example with regards to space trimming in
  path segments, can lead Spring Security to not recognize certain paths as not protected
  that are in fact mapped to Spring MVC controllers that should be protected. The
  problem is compounded by the fact that the Spring Framework provides richer features
  with regards to pattern matching as well as by the fact that pattern matching in
  each Spring Security and the Spring Framework can easily be customized creating
  additional differences."
