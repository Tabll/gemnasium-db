title: "Erroneous authentication pass in Spring Security"
description: "In Spring Security, versions 5.7.x prior to 5.7.12, 5.8.x prior to 5.8.11,
  versions 6.0.x prior to 6.0.9, versions 6.1.x prior to 6.1.8, versions 6.2.x prior
  to 6.2.3, an application is possible vulnerable to broken access control when it
  directly uses the AuthenticatedVoter#vote passing a null Authentication parameter.\n\nSpecifically,
  an application is vulnerable if:\n\nThe application uses AuthenticatedVoter directly
  and a null authentication parameter is passed to it resulting in an erroneous true
  return value.\n\nAn application is not vulnerable if any of the following is true:\n\n*
  The application does not use AuthenticatedVoter#vote directly.\n* The application
  does not pass null to AuthenticatedVoter#vote.\n\nNote that AuthenticatedVoter is
  deprecated since 5.8, use implementations of AuthorizationManager as a replacement."
