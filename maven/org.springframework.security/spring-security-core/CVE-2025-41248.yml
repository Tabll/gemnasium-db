title: "Spring Security annotation detection mechanism has authorization bypass"
description: "The Spring Security annotation detection mechanism may not correctly
  resolve annotations on methods within type hierarchies with a parameterized super
  type with unbounded generics. This can be an issue when using @PreAuthorize and
  other method security annotations, resulting in an authorization bypass.\n\nYour
  application may be affected by this if you are using Spring Security's @EnableMethodSecurity feature.\n\nYou
  are not affected by this if you are not using @EnableMethodSecurity or if you do
  not use security annotations on methods in generic superclasses or generic interfaces.\n\nThis
  CVE is published in conjunction with  CVE-2025-41249 https://spring.io/security/cve-2025-41249
