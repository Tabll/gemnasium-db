identifier: "CVE-2021-22112"
package_slug: "maven/org.springframework.security/spring-security-core"
title: "Privilege Escalation"
description: "Spring Security can fail to save the `SecurityContext` if it is changed
  more than once in a single request. A malicious user cannot cause the bug to happen
  (it must be programmed in). However, if the application's intent is to only allow
  the user to run with elevated privileges in a small portion of the application,
  the bug can be leveraged to extend those privileges to the rest of the application."
