title: "Broken Access Control in Spring Security With Direct Use of isFullyAuthenticated"
description: "In Spring Security, versions 6.1.x prior to 6.1.7 and versions 6.2.x
  prior to 6.2.2, an application is vulnerable to broken access control when it directly
  uses the AuthenticationTrustResolver.isFullyAuthenticated(Authentication) method.\n\nSpecifically,
  an application is vulnerable if:\n\n * The application uses AuthenticationTrustResolver.isFullyAuthenticated(Authentication) directly
  and a null authentication parameter is passed to it resulting in an erroneous true return
  value.\n\n\nAn application is not vulnerable if any of the following is true:\n\n
  * The application does not use AuthenticationTrustResolver.isFullyAuthenticated(Authentication) directly.\n
  * The application does not pass null to AuthenticationTrustResolver.isFullyAuthenticated\n
  * The application only uses isFullyAuthenticated via Method Security https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/authorization/method-security.html
   or HTTP Request Security https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/authorization/authorize-http-requests.html
