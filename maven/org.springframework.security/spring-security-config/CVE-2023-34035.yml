title: "Incorrect Authorization"
description: "Spring Security versions 5.8 prior to 5.8.5, 6.0 prior to 6.0.5, and
  6.1 prior to 6.1.2 could be susceptible to authorization rule misconfiguration if
  the application uses requestMatchers(String) and multiple servlets, one of them
  being Spring MVC’s DispatcherServlet. (DispatcherServlet is a Spring MVC component
  that maps HTTP endpoints to methods on @Controller-annotated classes.)\n\nSpecifically,
  an application is vulnerable when all of the following are true:\n\n * Spring MVC
  is on the classpath\n * Spring Security is securing more than one servlet in a single
  application (one of them being Spring MVC’s DispatcherServlet)\n * The application
  uses requestMatchers(String) to refer to endpoints that are not Spring MVC endpoints\n\n\nAn
  application is not vulnerable if any of the following is true:\n\n * The application
  does not have Spring MVC on the classpath\n * The application secures no servlets
  other than Spring MVC’s DispatcherServlet\n * The application uses requestMatchers(String) only
  for Spring MVC endpoints\n\n\n\n"
