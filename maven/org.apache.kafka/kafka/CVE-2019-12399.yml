description: "When Connect workers in Apache Kafka are configured with one or more
  config providers, and a connector is created/updated on that Connect cluster to
  use an externalized secret variable in a substring of a connector configuration
  property value, then any client can issue a request to the same Connect cluster
  to obtain the connector's task configuration and the response will contain the plaintext
  secret rather than the externalized secrets variables."
