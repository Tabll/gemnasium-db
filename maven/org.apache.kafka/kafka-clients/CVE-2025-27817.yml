title: "Apache Kafka Client Arbitrary File Read and Server Side Request Forgery Vulnerability"
description: "A possible arbitrary file read and SSRF vulnerability has been identified
  in Apache Kafka Client. Apache Kafka Clients accept configuration data for setting
  the SASL/OAUTHBEARER connection with the brokers, including \"sasl.oauthbearer.token.endpoint.url\"
  and \"sasl.oauthbearer.jwks.endpoint.url\". Apache Kafka allows clients to read
  an arbitrary file and return the content in the error log, or sending requests to
  an unintended location. In applications where Apache Kafka Clients configurations
  can be specified by an untrusted party, attackers may use the \"sasl.oauthbearer.token.endpoint.url\"
  and \"sasl.oauthbearer.jwks.endpoint.url\" configuratin to read arbitrary contents
  of the disk and environment variables or make requests to an unintended location.
  In particular, this flaw may be used in Apache Kafka Connect to escalate from REST
  API access to filesystem/environment/URL access, which may be undesirable in certain
  environments, including SaaS products.\n\nSince Apache Kafka 3.9.1/4.0.0, we have
  added a system property (\"-Dorg.apache.kafka.sasl.oauthbearer.allowed.urls\") to
  set the allowed urls in SASL JAAS configuration. In 3.9.1, it accepts all urls by
  default for backward compatibility. However in 4.0.0 and newer, the default value
  is empty list and users have to set the allowed urls explicitly."
