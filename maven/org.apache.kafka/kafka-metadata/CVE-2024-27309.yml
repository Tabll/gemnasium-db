title: "Apache Kafka: Potential incorrect access control during migration from ZK
  mode to KRaft mode"
description: "While an Apache Kafka cluster is being migrated from ZooKeeper mode
  to KRaft mode, in some cases ACLs will not be correctly enforced.\n\nTwo preconditions
  are needed to trigger the bug:\n1. The administrator decides to remove an ACL\n2.
  The resource associated with the removed ACL continues to have two or more other
  ACLs associated with it after the removal.\n\nWhen those two preconditions are met,
  Kafka will treat the resource as if it had only one ACL associated with it after
  the removal, rather than the two or more that would be correct.\n\nThe incorrect
  condition is cleared by removing all brokers in ZK mode, or by adding a new ACL
  to the affected resource. Once the migration is completed, there is no metadata
  loss (the ACLs all remain).\n\nThe full impact depends on the ACLs in use. If only
  ALLOW ACLs were configured during the migration, the impact would be limited to
  availability impact. if DENY ACLs were configured, the impact could include confidentiality
  and integrity impact depending on the ACLs configured, as the DENY ACLs might be
  ignored due to this vulnerability during the migration period."
