package_slug: "maven/com.xwiki.identity-oauth/identity-oauth-ui"
title: "Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')"
description: "com.xwiki.identity-oauth:identity-oauth-ui is a package to aid in building
  identity and service providers based on OAuth authorizations. When a user logs in
  via the OAuth method, the identityOAuth parameters sent in the GET request is vulnerable
  to cross site scripting (XSS) and XWiki syntax injection. This allows remote code
  execution via the groovy macro and thus affects the confidentiality, integrity and
  availability of the whole XWiki installation. The issue has been fixed in Identity
  OAuth version 1.6. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability and users
  are advised to upgrade."
