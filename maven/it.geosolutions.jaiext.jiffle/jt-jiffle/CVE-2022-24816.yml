package_slug: "maven/it.geosolutions.jaiext.jiffle/jt-jiffle"
title: "Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')"
description: "JAI-EXT is an open-source project which aims to extend the Java Advanced
  Imaging (JAI) API. Programs allowing Jiffle script to be provided via network request
  can lead to a Remote Code Execution as the Jiffle script is compiled into Java code
  via Janino, and executed. In particular, this affects the downstream GeoServer project.
  Version 1.2.22 will contain a patch that disables the ability to inject malicious
  code into the resulting script. Users unable to upgrade may negate the ability to
  compile Jiffle scripts from the final application, by removing janino-x.y.z.jar
  from the classpath."
