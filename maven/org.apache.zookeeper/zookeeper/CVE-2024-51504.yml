title: "Apache ZooKeeper: Authentication bypass with IP-based authentication in Admin
  Server"
description: "When using IPAuthenticationProvider in ZooKeeper Admin Server there
  is a possibility of Authentication Bypass by Spoofing -- this only impacts IP based
  authentication implemented in ZooKeeper Admin Server. Default configuration of client's
  IP address detection in IPAuthenticationProvider, which uses HTTP request headers,
  is weak and allows an attacker to bypass authentication via spoofing client's IP
  address in request headers. Default configuration honors X-Forwarded-For HTTP header
  to read client's IP address. X-Forwarded-For request header is mainly used by proxy
  servers to identify the client and can be easily spoofed by an attacker pretending
  that the request comes from a different IP address. Admin Server commands, such
  as snapshot and restore arbitrarily can be executed on successful exploitation which
  could potentially lead to information leakage or service availability issues. Users
  are recommended to upgrade to version 3.9.3, which fixes this issue."
