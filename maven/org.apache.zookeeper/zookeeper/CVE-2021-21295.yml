title: "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request Smuggling')"
description: "Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application
  framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers
  & clients. `Http2StreamFrameToHttpObjectCodec` is used to convert to HTTP/1.1 objects,
  and these HTTP/1.1 objects are forwarded to another remote peer. This has been patched
  Final As a workaround, the user can do the validation by themselves by implementing
  a custom `ChannelInboundHandler` that is put in the `ChannelPipeline` behind `Http2StreamFrameToHttpObjectCodec`."
