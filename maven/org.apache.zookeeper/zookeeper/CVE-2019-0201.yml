title: "Information disclosure"
description: "ZooKeeper's `getACL()` command does not check any permission when retrieves
  the ACLs of the requested node and returns all information contained in the ACL

  Authentication is in use, the unsalted hash value will be disclosed by `getACL()`
  request for unauthenticated or unprivileged users."
