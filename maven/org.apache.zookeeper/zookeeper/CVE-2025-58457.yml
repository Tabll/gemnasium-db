package_slug: "maven/org.apache.zookeeper/zookeeper"
title: "Apache ZooKeeper: Insufficient Permission Check in AdminServer Snapshot/Restore
  Commands"
description: "Improper permission checks in the AdminServer allow an authenticated
  client with insufficient privileges to invoke the `snapshot` and `restore` commands.
  The intended requirement is authentication and authorization on the root path (`/`)
  with **ALL** permission for these operations; however, affected versions permit
  invocation without that level of authorization. The primary risk is disclosure of
  cluster state via snapshots to a lesser-privileged client.\n\n*   **Affected:**
  `org.apache.zookeeper:zookeeper` 3.9.0 through 3.9.3.\n*   **Fixed:** 3.9.4 (ZOOKEEPER-4964
  “check permissions individually during admin server auth”).\n*   **Mitigations:**\n*
  \  Disable both commands (`admin.snapshot.enabled`, `admin.restore.enabled`).\n*
  \  Disable AdminServer (`admin.enableServer`).\n*   Ensure the root ACL is not open;
  note that ZooKeeper ACLs are not recursive.\n*   Upgrade to 3.9.4."
