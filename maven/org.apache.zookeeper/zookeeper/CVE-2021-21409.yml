title: "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests (HTTP Request Smuggling)"
description: "Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application
  framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers
  & clients. In Netty (`io.netty:netty-codec-http2`), which is used by zookeeper,
  there is a vulnerability that enables request smuggling. The content-length header
  is not correctly validated if the request only uses a single `Http2HeaderFrame`
  with the `endStream` set to to true. This could lead to request smuggling if the
  request is proxied to a remote peer and translated to HTTP/1.1. This is a followup
  of GHSA-wm47-8v5p-wjpj/CVE-2021-21295 which did miss to fix this one case."
