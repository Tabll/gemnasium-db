title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "XWiki is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications
  built on top of it. When using default XWiki configuration, it's possible for an
  attacker to upload an SVG containing a script executed when executing the download
  action on the file. This problem has been patched so that the default configuration
  does not allow to display the SVG files in the browser. Users are advised to update
  or to disallow uploads of SVG files."
