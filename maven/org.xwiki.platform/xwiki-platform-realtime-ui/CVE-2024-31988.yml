package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-realtime-ui"
title: "XWiki Platform CSRF remote code execution through the realtime HTML Converter
  API"
description: "When the realtime editor is installed in XWiki, it allows arbitrary
  remote code execution with the interaction of an admin user with programming right.
  More precisely, by getting an admin user to either visit a crafted URL or to view
  an image with this URL that could be in a comment, the attacker can get the admin
  to execute arbitrary XWiki syntax including scripting macros with Groovy or Python
  code. This compromises the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole
  XWiki installation."
