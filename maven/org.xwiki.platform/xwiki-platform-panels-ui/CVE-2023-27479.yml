package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-panels-ui"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream
  Component ('Injection')"
description: "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
  for applications built on top of it. In affected versions any user with view rights
  can execute arbitrary Groovy, Python or Velocity code in XWiki leading to full access
  to the XWiki installation. The root cause is improper escaping of UIX parameters.
  A proof of concept exploit is to log in, add an `XWiki.UIExtensionClass` xobject
  to the user profile page, with an Extension Parameters content containing `label={{/html}}
  {{async async=\"true\" cached=\"false\" context=\"doc.reference\"}}{{groovy}}println(\"Hello
  \" + \"from groovy!\"){{/groovy}}{{/async}}`. Then, navigating to `PanelsCode.ApplicationsPanelConfigurationSheet`
  (i.e., `<xwiki-host>/xwiki/bin/view/PanelsCode/ApplicationsPanelConfigurationSheet`
  where `<xwiki-host>` is the URL of your XWiki installation) should not execute the
  Groovy script. If it does, you will see `Hello from groovy!` displayed on the screen.
  This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 13.10.11, 14.4.7 and 14.10-rc-1. Users
  are advised to upgrade. For users unable to upgrade the issue can be fixed by editing
  the `PanelsCode.ApplicationsPanelConfigurationSheet` wiki page and making the same
  modifications as shown in commit `6de5442f3c`."
