- "GHSA-mvp5-qx9c-c3fv"
package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-rest-server"
title: "XWiki makes title of inaccessible pages available through the class property
  values REST API"
description: "The title of every single page whose reference is known can be accessed
  through the REST API as long as an XClass with a page property is accessible, this
  is the default for an XWiki installation. This allows an attacker to get titles
  of pages whose reference is known, one title per request. This doesn't affect fully
  [private wikis](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Access%20Rights/#HPrivateWiki)
  as the REST endpoint checks access rights on the XClass definition. The impact on
  confidentiality depends on the strategy for page names. By default, page names match
  the title, so the impact should be low but if page names are intentionally obfuscated
  because the titles are sensitive, the impact could be high."
