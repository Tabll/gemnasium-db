package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-rest-server"
title: "XWiki Platform is vulnerable to HQL injection via wiki and space search REST
  API"
description: "The REST search URL is vulnerable to HQL injection via the `orderField`
  parameter. The specified value is added twice in the query, though, once in the
  field list for the select and once in the order clause, so it's not that easy to
  exploit. The part of the query between the two fields can be enclosed in single
  quotes to effectively remove them, but the query still needs to remain valid with
  the query two times in it.\n\nFor example, with the following `orderField` parameter:"
date: "2025-10-06"
pubdate: "2025-10-06"
affected_range: "[17.0.0-rc-1,17.4.2),[4.3-milestone-1,16.10.9)"
fixed_versions:
- "17.4.2"
- "16.10.9"
affected_versions: "All versions starting from 4.3-milestone-1 before 16.10.9, all
  versions starting from 17.0.0-rc-1 before 17.4.2"
not_impacted: "All versions before 4.3-milestone-1, all versions starting from 16.10.9
  before 17.0.0-rc-1, all versions starting from 17.4.2"
solution: "Upgrade to versions 16.10.9, 17.4.2 or above."
