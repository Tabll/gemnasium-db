package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-rest-server"
title: "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
description: "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
  for applications built on top of it. The REST API allows executing all actions via
  POST requests and accepts `text/plain`, `multipart/form-data` or `application/www-form-urlencoded`
  as content types which can be sent via regular HTML forms, thus allowing cross-site
  request forgery. With the interaction of a user with programming rights, this allows
  remote code execution through script macros and thus impacts the integrity, availability
  and confidentiality of the whole XWiki installation. For regular cookie-based authentication,
  the vulnerability is mitigated by SameSite cookie restrictions but as of March 2023,
  these are not enabled by default in Firefox and Safari. The vulnerability has been
  patched in XWiki 14.10.8 and 15.2 by requiring a CSRF token header for certain request
  types that are susceptible to CSRF attacks.\n\n"
