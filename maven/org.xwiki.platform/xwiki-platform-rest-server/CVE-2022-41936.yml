title: "Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
  for applications built on top of it. The `modifications` rest endpoint does not
  filter out entries according to the user's rights. Therefore, information hidden
  from unauthorized users are exposed though the `modifications` rest endpoint (comments
  and page names etc). Users should upgrade to XWiki 14.6+, 14.4.3+, or 13.10.8+.
  Older versions have not been patched. There are no known workarounds."
