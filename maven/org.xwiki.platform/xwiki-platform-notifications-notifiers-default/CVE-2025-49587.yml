package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-notifications-notifiers-default"
title: "XWiki does not require right warnings for notification displayer objects"
description: "When a user without script right creates a document with an `XWiki.Notifications.Code.NotificationDisplayerClass`
  object, and later an admin edits and saves that document, the possibly malicious
  content of that object is output as raw HTML, allowing XSS attacks. While the notification
  displayer executes Velocity, the existing generic analyzer already warns admins
  before editing Velocity code. Note that warnings before editing documents with dangerous
  properties have only been introduced in XWiki 15.9, before that version, this was
  a known issue and the advice was simply to be careful."
