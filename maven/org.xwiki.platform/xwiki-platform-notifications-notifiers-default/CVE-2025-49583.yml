package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-notifications-notifiers-default"
title: "XWiki provides no warning when granting XWiki.Notifications.Code.NotificationEmailRendererClass
  admin right"
description: "When a user without script right creates a document with an `XWiki.Notifications.Code.NotificationEmailRendererClass`
  object, and later an admin edits and saves that document, the email templates in
  this object will be used for notifications. No malicious code can be executed, though,
  as while these templates allow Velocity code, the existing generic analyzer already
  warns admins before editing Velocity code. The main impact would thus be to send
  spam, e.g., with phishing links to other users or to hide notifications about other
  attacks. Note that warnings before editing documents with dangerous properties have
  only been introduced in XWiki 15.9, before that version, this was a known issue
  and the advice was simply to be careful."
