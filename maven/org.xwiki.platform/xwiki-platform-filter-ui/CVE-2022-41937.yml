title: "Missing Authorization"
description: "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
  for applications built on top of it. The application allows anyone with view access
  to modify any page of the wiki by importing a crafted XAR package. The problem has
  been patched in XWiki 14.6RC1, 14.6 and 13.10.8. As a workaround, setting the right
  of the page Filter.WebHome and making sure only the main wiki administrators can
  view the application installed on main wiki or edit the page and apply the changed
  described in commit fb49b4f."
