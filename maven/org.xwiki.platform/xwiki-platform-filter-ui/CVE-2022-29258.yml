package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-filter-ui"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)"
description: "XWiki Platform Filter UI provides a generic user interface to convert
  from a XWiki Filter input stream to an output stream with settings for each stream.
  Starting with versions 6.0-milestone-2 and 5.4.4 and prior to versions 12.10.11,
  14.0-rc-1, 13.4.7, and 13.10.3, XWiki Platform Filter UI contains a possible cross-site
  scripting vector in the `Filter.FilterStreamDescriptorForm` wiki page related to
  pretty much all the form fields printed in the home page of the application. The
  issue is patched in versions 12.10.11, 14.0-rc-1, 13.4.7, and 13.10.3. The easiest
  workaround is to edit the wiki page `Filter.FilterStreamDescriptorForm` (with wiki
  editor) according to the instructions in the GitHub Security Advisory."
