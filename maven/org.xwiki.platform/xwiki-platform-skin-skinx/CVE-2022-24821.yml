title: "Incorrect Use of Privileged APIs"
description: "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
  for applications built on top of it. Simple users can create global SSX/JSX without
  specific rights: in theory only users with Programming Rights should be allowed
  to create SSX or JSX that are executed everywhere on a wiki. But a bug allow anyone
  with edit rights to actually create those. This issue has been patched in XWiki
  13.10-rc-1, 12.10.11 and 13.4.6. There's no easy workaround for this issue, administrators
  should upgrade their wiki."
