package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-lesscss-script"
title: "The lesscss script service allows cache clearing without programming right"
description: "The script API of the LESS compiler in XWiki is incorrectly checking
  for rights when calling the cache cleaning API, making it possible to clean the
  cache without having programming right. The only impact of this is a slowdown in
  XWiki execution as the caches are re-filled. As this vulnerability requires script
  right to exploit, and script right already allows unlimited execution of scripts,
  the additional impact due to this vulnerability is low."
