package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-component-wiki"
title: "org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-component-wiki provides no warning when
  granting XWiki.ComponentClass programming right"
description: "When a user with programming right edits a document in XWiki that was
  last edited by a user without programming right and contains an `XWiki.ComponentClass`,
  there is no warning that this will grant programming right to this object. An attacker
  who created such a malicious object could use this to gain programming right on
  the wiki. For this, the attacker needs to have edit right on at least one page to
  place this object and then get an admin user to edit that document.\n\nTo reproduce
  the problem, as a user without programming right, add an object of type `XWiki.ComponentClass`
  to any page and then edit the page as a user with programming right. There should
  be warning displayed, if not, the XWiki installation is vulnerable.\n\nWhile such
  a warning didn't exist in any version of XWiki, only in XWiki 15.9 RC1 these kinds
  of warnings have been introduced which is why this is considered the first version
  that has this vulnerability. Before that, the advice was to be careful when editing
  pages edited by untrusted users."
