title: "XWiki's required right warnings for macros are incomplete"
description: "When editing content that contains \"dangerous\" macros like malicious
  script macros that were authored by a user with fewer rights, XWiki warns about
  the execution of these macros since XWiki 15.9RC1. These required rights analyzers
  that trigger these warnings are incomplete, allowing an attacker to hide malicious
  content. For most macros, the existing analyzers don't consider non-lowercase parameters.
  Further, most macro parameters that can contain XWiki syntax like titles of information
  boxes weren't analyzed at all. Similarly, the \"source\" parameters of the content
  and context macro weren't anylzed even though they could contain arbitrary XWiki
  syntax. In the worst case, this could allow a malicious to add malicious script
  macros including Groovy or Python macros to a page that are then executed after
  another user with programming righs edits the page, thus allowing remote code execution."
