package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-office-viewer"
title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
  for applications built on top of it. The office document viewer macro was allowing
  anyone to see any file content from the hosting server, provided that the office
  server was connected and depending on the permissions of the user running the servlet
  engine (e.g. tomcat) running XWiki. The same vulnerability also allowed to perform
  internal requests to resources from the hosting server. The problem has been patched
  in XWiki 13.10.11, 14.10.1, 14.4.8, 15.0-rc-1. Users are advised to upgrade. It
  might be possible to workaround this vulnerability by running XWiki in a sandbox
  with a user with very low privileges on the machine.\n\n"
