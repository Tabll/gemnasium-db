package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-ratings-api"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')"
description: "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
  for applications built on top of it. In affected versions of XWiki Platform (and
  only those with the Ratings API installed), the Rating Script Service expose an
  API to perform SQL requests without escaping the from and where search arguments.
  This might lead to an SQL script injection quite easily for any user having Script
  rights on XWiki. The problem has been patched in XWiki 12.9RC1. The only workaround
  besides upgrading XWiki would be to uninstall the Ratings API in XWiki from the
  Extension Manager."
