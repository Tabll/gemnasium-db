package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-distribution-war"
title: "XWiki Platform has an SQL injection in getdocuments.vm with sort parameter"
description: "In `getdocument.vm` ; the ordering of the returned documents is defined
  from an unsanitized request parameter (request.sort) and can allow any user to inject
  HQL.\n\nDepending on the used database backend, the attacker may be able to not
  only obtain confidential information such as password hashes from the database,
  but also execute UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE queries.\n\nIt's possible to employ database
  backend dependent techniques of breaking out of HQL query context, described, for
  example, here: https://www.sonarsource.com/blog/exploiting-hibernate-injections."
