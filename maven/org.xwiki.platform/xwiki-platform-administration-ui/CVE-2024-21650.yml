title: "Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval
  Injection')"
description: "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
  for applications built on top of it. XWiki is vulnerable to a remote code execution
  (RCE) attack through its user registration feature. This issue allows an attacker
  to execute arbitrary code by crafting malicious payloads in the \"first name\" or
  \"last name\" fields during user registration. This impacts all installations that
  have user registration enabled for guests. This vulnerability has been patched in
  XWiki 14.10.17, 15.5.3 and 15.8 RC1."
