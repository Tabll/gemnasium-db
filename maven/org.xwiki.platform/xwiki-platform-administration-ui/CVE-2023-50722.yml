package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-administration-ui"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in 2.3 and prior
  to versions 14.10.15, 15.5.2, and 15.7-rc-1, there is a reflected XSS or also direct
  remote code execution vulnerability in the code for displaying configurable admin
  sections. The code that can be passed through a URL parameter is only executed when
  the user who is visiting the crafted URL has edit right on at least one configuration
  section. While any user of the wiki could easily create such a section, this vulnerability
  does not require the attacker to have an account or any access on the wiki. It is
  sufficient to trick any admin user of the XWiki installation to visit the crafted
  URL. This vulnerability allows full remote code execution with programming rights
  and thus impacts the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki
  installation. This has been fixed in XWiki 14.10.15, 15.5.2 and 15.7RC1. The patch
  can be manually applied to the document `XWiki.ConfigurableClass`.\n"
