  rights analysis doesn't consider TextAreas with default content type"
description: "When editing a page, XWiki warns since version 15.9 when there is content
  on the page like a script macro that would gain more rights due to the editing.
  This analysis doesn't consider certain kinds of properties, allowing a user to put
  malicious scripts in there that will be executed after a user with script, admin,
  or programming rights edited the page. Such a malicious script could impact the
  confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation.\n\nTo
  reproduce, as a user without script right, create a class with a `TextArea` property,
  create page with an object of that class and a Velocity macro in its content. Then,
  as an admin, try editing that page. Normally, there should be a warning but in vulnerable
  versions of XWiki, there is no warning."
