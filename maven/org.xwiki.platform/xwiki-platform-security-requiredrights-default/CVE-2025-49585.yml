package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-security-requiredrights-default"
title: "XWiki does not require right warnings for XClass definitions"
description: "When an attacker without script or programming right creates an XClass
  definition in XWiki (requires edit right), and that same document is later edited
  by a user with script, admin, or programming right, malicious code could be executed
  with the rights of the editing user without prior warning. In particular, this concerns
  custom display code, the script of computed properties and queries in database list
  properties. Note that warnings before editing documents with dangerous properties
  have only been introduced in XWiki 15.9, before that version, this was a known issue
  and the advice was simply to be careful."
