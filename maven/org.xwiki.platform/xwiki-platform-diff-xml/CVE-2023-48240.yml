title: "Cookies are sent to external images in rendered diff (and server side request
  forgery)"
description: "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. The rendered diff in XWiki
  embeds images to be able to compare the contents and not display a difference for
  an actually unchanged image. For this, XWiki requests all embedded images on the
  server side. These requests are also sent for images from other domains and include
  all cookies that were sent in the original request to ensure that images with restricted
  view right can be compared. Starting in version 11.10.1 and prior to versions 14.10.15,
  15.5.1, and 15.6, this allows an attacker to steal login and session cookies that
  allow impersonating the current user who views the diff. The attack can be triggered
  with an image that references the rendered diff, thus making it easy to trigger.
  Apart from stealing login cookies, this also allows server-side request forgery
  (the result of any successful request is returned in the image's source) and viewing
  protected content as once a resource is cached, it is returned for all users. As
  only successful requests are cached, the cache will be filled by the first user
  who is allowed to access the resource. This has been patched in XWiki 14.10.15,
  15.5.1 and 15.6. The rendered diff now only downloads images from trusted domains.
  Further, cookies are only sent when the image's domain is the same the requested
  domain. The cache has been changed to be specific for each user. As a workaround,
  the image embedding feature can be disabled by deleting `xwiki-platform-diff-xml-<version>.jar`
  in `WEB-INF/lib/`."
