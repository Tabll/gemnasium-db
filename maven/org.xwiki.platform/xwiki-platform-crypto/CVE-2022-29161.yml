package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-crypto"
title: "Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm"
description: "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
  for applications built on top of it. The XWiki Crypto API will generate X509 certificates
  signed by default using SHA1 with RSA, which is not considered safe anymore for
  use in certificate signatures, due to the risk of collisions with SHA1. The problem
  has been patched in XWiki version 13.10.6, 14.3.1 and 14.4-rc-1. Since then, the
  Crypto API will generate X509 certificates signed by default using SHA256 with RSA.
  Administrators are advised to upgrade their XWiki installation to one of the patched
  versions. If the upgrade is not possible, it is possible to patch the module xwiki-platform-crypto
  in a local installation by applying the change exposed in 26728f3 and re-compiling
  the module."
