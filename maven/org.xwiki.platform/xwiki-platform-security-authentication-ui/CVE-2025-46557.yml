package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-security-authentication-ui"
title: "Any user with view access to the XWiki space can change the authenticator"
description: "A user who can access pages located in the XWiki space (by default,
  anyone) can access the page `XWiki.Authentication.Administration` and (unless an
  authenticator is set in `xwiki.cfg`) switch to another installed authenticator.\n\nNote
  that, by default, there is only one authenticator available (`Standard XWiki Authenticator`).
  So, if no authenticator extension was installed, it's not really possible to do
  anything for an attacker.\n\nAlso, in most cases, if you have installed and are
  using an SSO authenticator (like OIDC or LDAP for example), the worst an attacker
  can do is break authentication by switching back to the standard authenticator (that's
  because it's impossible to login to a user which does not have a stored password,
  and that's usually what SSO authenticator produce)."
