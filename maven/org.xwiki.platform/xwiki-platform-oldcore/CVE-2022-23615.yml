title: "Partial authorization bypass on document save in xwiki-platform"
description: "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
  for applications built on top of it. In affected versions any user with SCRIPT right
  can save a document with the right of the current user which allow accessing API
  requiring programming right if the current user has programming right. This has
  been patched in XWiki 13.0. Users are advised to update to resolve this issue. The
  only known workaround is to limit SCRIPT access."
