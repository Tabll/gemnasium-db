package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-oldcore"
title: "XWiki leaks password hashes and other accessible password properties"
description: "Any user with edit right on a page of the wiki can create an XClass
  with a database list property that references a password property, for example the
  password hash that is stored for users. When adding an object of that XClass, the
  content of that password property is displayed. In practice, with a standard rights
  setup, this means that any user with an account on the wiki can access password
  hashes of all users, and possibly other password properties (with hashed or plain
  storage) that are on pages that the user can view."
