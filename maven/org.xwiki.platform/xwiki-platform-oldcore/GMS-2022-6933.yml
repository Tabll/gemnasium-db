package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-oldcore"
title: "Missing Authorization in User#setDisabledStatus in org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-oldcore"
description: "### Impact\n\nIt's possible for a user with only Script rights to enable
  or disable a user: this operation should be only doable for users with admin rights.
  \n\n### Patches\n\nThis problem has been patched in XWiki 13.10.7, 14.4.2 and 14.5RC1.\n\n###
  Workarounds\n\nThere is no workaround other than upgrading the wiki, but note that
  this only impacts users with Script rights: administrator should take care which
  users have such right. \n\n### References\n\n * https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-19804\n
  * https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/0b732f2ef0224e2aaf10e2e1ef48dbd3fb6e10cd\n\n###
