description: "In XWiki before versions 11.10.5 or 12.2.1, any user with SCRIPT right
  (EDIT right before XWiki 7.4) can gain access to the application server Servlet
  context which contains tools allowing to instantiate arbitrary Java objects and
  invoke methods that may lead to arbitrary code execution. The only workaround is
  to give SCRIPT right only to trusted users."
