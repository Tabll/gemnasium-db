title: "XWiki Platform: Password hash might be leaked by diff once the xobject holding
  them is deleted"
description: "It is possible to access the hash of a password by using the diff feature
  of the history whenever the object storing the password is deleted. Using that vulnerability
  it's possible for an attacker to have access to the hash password of a user if they
  have rights to edit the users' page.\n\nNow with the default right scheme in XWiki
  this vulnerability is normally prevented on user profiles, except by users with
  Admin rights. Note that this vulnerability also impacts any extensions that might
  use passwords stored in xobjects: for those usecases it depends on the right of
  those pages.\n\nThere is currently no way to be 100% sure that this vulnerability
  has been exploited, as an attacker with enough privilege could have deleted the
  revision where the xobject was deleted after rolling-back the deletion. But again,
  this operation requires high privileges on the target page (Admin right). A page
  with a user password xobject which have in its history a revision where the object
  has been deleted should be considered at risk and the password should be changed
  there."
