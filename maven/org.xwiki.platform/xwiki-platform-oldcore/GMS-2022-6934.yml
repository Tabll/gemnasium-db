title: "Creation of new database tables through login form on PostgreSQL"
description: "### Impact\n\nIt's possible to make XWiki create many new schemas and
  fill them with tables just by using a crafted user identifier in the login form.\n\n###
  Patches\n\nThe problem has been patched in XWiki 13.10.8, 14.6RC1 and 14.4.2.\n\n###
  Workarounds\n\nThe only workarounds for this are:\n* use an authenticator which
  does interpret the login as a reference to a document\n* using a different database
  than PostgreSQL\n* upgrade XWiki\n\n### References\n\nhttps://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-19886\n\n###
