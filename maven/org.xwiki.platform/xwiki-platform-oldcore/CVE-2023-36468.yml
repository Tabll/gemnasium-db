title: "Incomplete Cleanup"
description: "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
  for applications built on top of it. When an XWiki installation is upgraded and
  that upgrade contains a fix for a bug in a document, just a new version of that
  document is added. In some cases, it's still possible to exploit the vulnerability
  that was fixed in the new version. The severity of this depends on the fixed vulnerability,
  for the purpose of this advisory take CVE-2022-36100/GHSA-2g5c-228j-p52x as example
  - it is easily exploitable with just view rights and critical. When XWiki is upgraded
  from a version before the fix for it (e.g., 14.3) to a version including the fix
  (e.g., 14.4), the vulnerability can still be reproduced by adding `rev=1.1` to the
  URL used in the reproduction steps so remote code execution is possible even after
  upgrading. Therefore, this affects the confidentiality, integrity and availability
  of the whole XWiki installation. This vulnerability also affects manually added
  script macros that contained security vulnerabilities that were later fixed by changing
  the script macro without deleting the versions with the security vulnerability from
  the history. This vulnerability does not affect freshly installed versions of XWiki.
  Further, this vulnerability does not affect content that is only loaded from the
  current version of a document like the code of wiki macros or UI extensions. This
  vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 14.10.7 and 15.2RC1 by forcing old revisions
  to be executed in a restricted mode that disables all script macros. As a workaround,
  admins can manually delete old revisions of affected documents. A script could be
  used to identify all installed documents and delete the history for them. However,
  also manually added and later corrected code may be affected by this vulnerability
  so it is easy to miss documents."
