package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-oldcore"
title: "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
description: "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
  for applications built on top of it. The create action is vulnerable to a CSRF attack,
  allowing script and thus remote code execution when targeting a user with script/programming
  right, thus compromising the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the
  whole XWiki installation. When a user with script right views this image and a log
  message `ERROR foo - Script executed!` appears in the log, the XWiki installation
  is vulnerable. This has been patched in XWiki 14.10.9 and 15.4RC1 by requiring a
  CSRF token for the actual page creation."
