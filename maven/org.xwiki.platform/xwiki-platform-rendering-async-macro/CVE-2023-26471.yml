package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-rendering-async-macro"
title: "XWiki Platform users may execute anything with superadmin right through comments
  and async macro"
description: "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in version 11.6-rc-1,
  comments are supposed to be executed with the right of superadmin but in restricted
  mode (anything dangerous is disabled), but the async macro does not take into account
  the restricted mode. This means that any user with comment right can use the async
  macro to make it execute any wiki content with the right of superadmin. This has
  been patched in XWiki 14.9, 14.4.6, and 13.10.10. The only known workaround consists
  of applying a patch and rebuilding and redeploying `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-rendering-async-macro`."
