title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "XWiki Platform Attachment UI provides a macro to easily upload and select
  attachments for XWiki Platform, a generic wiki platform. Starting with version 14.0-rc-1
  and prior to 14.4-rc-1, it's possible to store JavaScript in an attachment name,
  which will be executed by anyone trying to move the corresponding attachment. This
  issue has been patched in XWiki 14.4-rc-1. As a workaround, one may copy `moveStep1.vm`
  to `webapp/xwiki/templates/moveStep1.vm` and replace vulnerable code with code from
  the patch."
