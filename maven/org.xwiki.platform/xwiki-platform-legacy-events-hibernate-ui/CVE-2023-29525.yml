package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-legacy-events-hibernate-ui"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream
  Component ('Injection')"
description: "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
  for applications built on top of it. Affected versions of xwiki are subject to code
  injection in the `since` parameter of the `/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/Notifications/Code/LegacyNotificationAdministration`
  endpoint. This provides an XWiki syntax injection attack via the since-parameter,
  allowing privilege escalation from view to programming rights and subsequent code
  execution privilege. The vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 15.0-rc-1, 14.10.3,
  14.4.8 and 14.10.3. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may modify
  the page `XWiki.Notifications.Code.LegacyNotificationAdministration` to add the
  missing escaping. For versions < 14.6-rc-1 a workaround is to modify the file `<xwikiwebapp>/templates/distribution/eventmigration.wiki`
  to add the missing escaping."
