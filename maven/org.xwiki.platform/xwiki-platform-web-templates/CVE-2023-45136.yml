package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-web-templates"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
  for applications built on top of it. When document names are validated according
  to a name strategy (disabled by default), XWiki starting in version 12.0-rc-1 and
  prior to versions 12.10.12 and 15.5-rc-1 is vulnerable to a reflected cross-site
  scripting attack in the page creation form. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary
  actions with the rights of the user opening the malicious link. Depending on the
  rights of the user, this may allow remote code execution and full read and write
  access to the whole XWiki installation. This has been patched in XWiki 14.10.12
  and 15.5-rc-1 by adding appropriate escaping. The vulnerable template file `createinline.vm`
  is part of XWiki's WAR and can be patched by manually applying the changes from
  the fix."
