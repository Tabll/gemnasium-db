package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-web-templates"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
  for applications built on top of it.This template is only used in the following
  conditions: The wiki must be open to registration for anyone. The wiki must be closed
  to view for Guest users or more specifically the XWiki.Registration page must be
  forbidden in View for guest user. A way to obtain the second condition is when administrators
  checked the \"Prevent unregistered users from viewing pages, regardless of the page
  rights\" box in the administration rights. This issue is patched There are two main
  ways for protecting against this vulnerability, the easiest and the best one is
  by applying a patch in the `registerinline.vm` template, the patch consists in checking
  the value of the xredirect field to ensure it matches: `<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"xredirect\"
  value=\"$escapetool.xml($!request.xredirect)\" />`. If for some reason it's not
  possible to patch this file, another workaround is to ensure \"Prevent unregistered
  users from viewing pages, regardless of the page rights\" is not checked in the
  rights and apply a better right scheme using groups and rights on spaces."
