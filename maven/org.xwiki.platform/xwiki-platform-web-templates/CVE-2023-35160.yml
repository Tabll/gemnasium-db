title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
  for applications built on top of it. Users are able to forge an URL with a payload
  allowing to inject Javascript in the page (XSS). It's possible to exploit the resubmit
  template to perform a XSS, e.g. by using URL such as: > xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/Main
  xpage=resubmit&resubmit=javascript:alert(document.domain)&xback=javascript:alert(document.domain).
  This vulnerability exists since XWiki 2.5-milestone-2. The vulnerability has been
  patched in XWiki 14.10.5 and 15.1-rc-1."
