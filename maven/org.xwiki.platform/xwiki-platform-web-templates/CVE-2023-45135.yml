package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-web-templates"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command
  Injection')"
description: "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
  for applications built on top of it. In `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web`
  versions 7.2-milestone-2 until 14.10.12 and `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web-templates`
  prior to versions 14.10.12 and 15.5-rc-1, it is possible to pass a title to the
  page creation action that isn't displayed at first but then executed in the second
  step. This can be used by an attacker to trick a victim to execute code, allowing
  script execution if the victim has script right or remote code execution including
  full access to the XWiki instance if the victim has programming right."
