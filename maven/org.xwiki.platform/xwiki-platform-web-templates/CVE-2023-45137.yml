package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-web-templates"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
  for applications built on top of it. `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web` starting
  in version 3.1-milestone-2 and prior to version 13.4-rc-1, as well as `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web-templates`
  prior to versions 14.10.12 and 15.5-rc-1, is vulnerable to cross-site scripting.
  When trying to create a document that already exists, XWiki displays an error message
  in the form for creating it. Due to missing escaping, this error message is vulnerable
  to raw HTML injection and thus XSS. The injected code is the document reference
  of the existing document so this requires that the attacker first creates a non-empty
  document whose name contains the attack code. This has been patched in `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web`
  version 13.4-rc-1 and `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web-templates` versions
  14.10.12 and 15.5-rc-1 by adding the appropriate escaping. The vulnerable template
  file `createinline.vm` is part of XWiki's WAR and can be patched by manually applying
  the changes from the fix."
