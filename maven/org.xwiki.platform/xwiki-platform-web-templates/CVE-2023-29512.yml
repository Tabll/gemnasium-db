title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream
  Component ('Injection')"
description: "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
  for applications built on top of it. Any user with edit rights on a page (e.g.,
  it's own user page), can execute arbitrary Groovy, Python or Velocity code in XWiki
  leading to full access to the XWiki installation. The root cause is improper escaping
  of the information loaded from attachments in `imported.vm`, `importinline.vm`,
  and `packagelist.vm`. This page is installed by default. This vulnerability has
  been patched in XWiki 15.0-rc-1, 14.10.1, 14.4.8, and 13.10.11. Users are advised
  to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
