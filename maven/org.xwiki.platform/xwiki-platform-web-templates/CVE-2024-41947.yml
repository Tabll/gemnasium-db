package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-web-templates"
title: "XWiki Platform vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through conflict resolution"
description: "By creating a conflict when another user with more rights is currently
  editing a page, it is possible to execute JavaScript snippets on the side of the
  other user, which compromises the confidentiality, integrity and availability of
  the whole XWiki installation.\n\nTo reproduce on a XWiki instance, a user with admin
  rights needs to edit a document without saving right away.\nThen, as another user
  without any other right than edit on the specific document, change the whole content
  to `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`.\nWhen the admin user then saves the document,
  a conflict popup appears. If they select \"Fix each conflict individually\" and
  see an alert displaying \"XSS\", then the instance is vulnerable."
