package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-display-api"
title: "XWiki Platform privilege escalation from script right to programming right
  through title displayer"
description: "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
  for applications built on top of it. In affected versions it's possible for a user
  to write a script in which any velocity content is executed with the right of any
  other document content author. Since this API require programming right and the
  user does not have it, the expected result is `$doc.document.authors.contentAuthor`
  (not executed script), unfortunately with the security vulnerability it is possible
  for the attacker to get `XWiki.superadmin` which shows that the title was executed
  with the right of the unmodified document. This has been patched in XWiki versions
  14.10.7 and 15.2RC1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
  for this vulnerability."
