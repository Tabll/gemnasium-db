title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "XWiki Platform Web Parent POM contains Web resources for the XWiki platform,
  a generic wiki platform. Starting with version 1.0 and prior to versions 13.10.6
  and 14.30-rc-1, it's possible to store JavaScript which will be executed by anyone
  viewing the history of an attachment containing javascript in its name. This issue
  has been patched in XWiki 13.10.6 and 14.3RC1. As a workaround, it is possible to
  replace `viewattachrev.vm`, the entry point for this attack, by a patched version
  from the patch without updating XWiki."
