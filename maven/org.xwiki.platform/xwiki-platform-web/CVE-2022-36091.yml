package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-web"
title: "Missing Authorization"
description: "XWiki Platform Web Templates are templates for XWiki Platform, a generic
  wiki platform. Through the suggestion feature, string and list properties of objects
  the user shouldn't have access to can be accessed in versions prior to 13.10.4 and
  14.2. This includes private personal information like email addresses and salted
  password hashes of registered users but also other information stored in properties
  of objects. Sensitive configuration fields like passwords for LDAP or SMTP servers
  could be accessed. By exploiting an additional vulnerability, this issue can even
  be exploited on private wikis at least for string properties. The issue is patched
  in version 13.10.4 and 14.2. Password properties are no longer displayed and rights
  are checked for other properties. A workaround is available. The template file `suggest.vm`
  can be replaced by a patched version without upgrading or restarting XWiki unless
  it has been overridden, in which case the overridden template should be patched,
  too. This might need adjustments for older versions, though."
