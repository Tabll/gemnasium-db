package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-flamingo-theme-ui"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)"
description: "XWiki Platform Flamingo Theme UI is a tool that allows customization
  and preview of any Flamingo-based skin. Starting with versions 6.2.4 and 6.3-rc-1,
  a possible cross-site scripting vector is present in the `FlamingoThemesCode.WebHomeSheet`
  wiki page related to the \"newThemeName\" form field. The issue is patched in versions
  12.10.11, 14.0-rc-1, 13.4.7, and 13.10.3. The easiest available workaround is to
  edit the wiki page `FlamingoThemesCode.WebHomeSheet` (with wiki editor) according
  to the suggestion provided in the GitHub Security Advisory."
