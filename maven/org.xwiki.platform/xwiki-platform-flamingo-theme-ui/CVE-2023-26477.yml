title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command
  Injection')"
description: "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in versions 6.3-rc-1
  and 6.2.4, it's possible to inject arbitrary wiki syntax including Groovy, Python
  and Velocity script macros via the `newThemeName` request parameter (URL parameter),
  in combination with additional parameters. This has been patched in the supported
  versions 13.10.10, 14.9-rc-1, and 14.4.6. As a workaround, it is possible to edit
  `FlamingoThemesCode.WebHomeSheet` and manually perform the changes from the patch
  fixing the issue."
