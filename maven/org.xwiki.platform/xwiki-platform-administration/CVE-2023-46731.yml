package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-administration"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval
  Injection')"
description: "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
  for applications built on top of it. XWiki does not properly escape the section
  URL parameter that is used in the code for displaying administration sections. This
  allows any user with read access to the document `XWiki.AdminSheet` (by default,
  everyone including unauthenticated users) to execute code including Groovy code.
  This impacts the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki
  instance. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 14.10.14, 15.6 RC1 and 15.5.1.
  Users are advised to upgrade. Users unablr to upgrade may apply the fix in commit
  `fec8e0e53f9` manually. Alternatively, to protect against attacks from unauthenticated
  users, view right for guests can be removed from this document (it is only needed
  for space and wiki admins)."
