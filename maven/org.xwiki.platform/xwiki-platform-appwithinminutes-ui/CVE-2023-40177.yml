package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-appwithinminutes-ui"
title: "XWiki Platform privilege escalation (PR) from account through AWM content
  fields"
description: "### Impact\n\nAny registered user can use the content field of their
  user profile page to execute arbitrary scripts with programming rights, thus effectively
  performing rights escalation.\n\nThe problem is present 
  [since version 4.3M2](https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-7369)
  when AppWithinMinutes Application added support for the Content field, allowing
  any wiki page (including the user profile page) to use its content as an AWM Content
  field, which has a custom displayer that executes the content with the rights of
  the ``AppWithinMinutes.Content`` author, rather than the rights of the content author.\n\n###
  Patches\n\nThe issue has been fixed in XWiki 14.10.5 and 15.1RC1 by 
  https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/dfb1cde173e363ca5c12eb3654869f9719820262
  . The fix is in the content of the 
  [AppWithinMinutes.Content](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/dfb1cde173e363ca5c12eb3654869f9719820262#diff-850f6875c40cf7932f40a985e99679a041891c6ee75d10239c06921c0019cf78R82)
  page that defines the custom displayer. By using the ``display`` script service
  to render the content we make sure that the proper author is used for access rights
  checks.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you want to fix this problem on older versions
  of XWiki that have not been patched then you need to modify the content of ``AppWithinMinutes.Content``
  page to use the ``display`` script service to render the content, like this:\n\n```\n-
  {{html}}$tdoc.getRenderedContent($tdoc.content, $tdoc.syntax.toIdString()).replace('{{',
  '&amp;#123;&amp;#123;'){{/html}}\n+ {{html}}$services.display.content($tdoc, {\n+
  \ 'displayerHint': 'default'\n+ }).replace('{{/html}}', 
  '&amp;#123;&amp;#123;/html&amp;#125;&amp;#125;'){{/html}}\n```\n\n###
