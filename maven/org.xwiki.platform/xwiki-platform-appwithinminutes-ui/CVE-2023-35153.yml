package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-appwithinminutes-ui"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in version 5.4.4
  and prior to versions 14.4.8, 14.10.4, and 15.0, a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability
  can be exploited by users with edit rights by adding a `AppWithinMinutes.FormFieldCategoryClass`
  class on a page and setting the payload on the page title. Then, any user visiting
  `/xwiki/bin/view/AppWithinMinutes/ClassEditSheet` executes the payload. The issue
  has been patched in XWiki 14.4.8, 14.10.4, and 15.0. As a workaround, update `AppWithinMinutes.ClassEditSheet`
  with a patch."
