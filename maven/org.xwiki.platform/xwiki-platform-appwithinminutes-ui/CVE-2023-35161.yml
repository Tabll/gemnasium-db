description: "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
  for applications built on top of it. Users are able to forge an URL with a payload
  allowing to inject Javascript in the page (XSS). It's possible to exploit the DeleteApplication
  page to perform a XSS, e.g. by using URL such as: > 
  xwiki/bin/view/AppWithinMinutes/DeleteApplication?appName=Menu&resolve=true&xredirect=javascript:alert(document.domain).
  This vulnerability exists since XWiki 6.2-milestone-1. The vulnerability has been
  patched in XWiki 14.10.5 and 15.1-rc-1.\n"
