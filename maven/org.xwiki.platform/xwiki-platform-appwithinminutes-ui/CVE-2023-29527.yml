  for applications built on top of it. In affected versions a user without script
  or programming right may edit a user profile (or any other document) with the wiki
  editor and add groovy script content. Viewing the document after saving it will
  execute the groovy script in the server context which provides code execution. This
  vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 15.0-rc-1 and 14.10.3. Users are advised
