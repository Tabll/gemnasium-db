title: "xwiki contains Exposed Dangerous Method or Function"
description: "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in version 14.3-rc-1,
  `org.xwiki.store.script.TemporaryAttachmentsScriptService#uploadTemporaryAttachment`
  returns an instance of `com.xpn.xwiki.doc.XWikiAttachment`. This class is not supported
  to be exposed to users without the `programing` right. `com.xpn.xwiki.api.Attachment`
  should be used instead and takes case of checking the user's rights before performing
  dangerous operations. This has been patched in versions 14.9-rc-1 and 14.4.6. There
  are no known workarounds for this issue."
