title: "Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges"
description: "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
  for applications built on top of it. The rollback action is missing a right protection,
  a user can rollback to a previous version of the page to gain rights they don't
  have anymore. The problem has been patched in XWiki 14.10.17, 15.5.3 and 15.8-rc-1
  by ensuring that the rights are checked before performing the rollback. "
