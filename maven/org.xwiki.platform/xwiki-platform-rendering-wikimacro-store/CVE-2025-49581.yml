package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-rendering-wikimacro-store"
title: "XWiki allows remote code execution through default value of wiki macro wiki-type
  parameters"
description: "Any user with edit right on a page (could be the user's profile) can
  execute code (Groovy, Python, Velocity) with programming right by defining a wiki
  macro. This allows full access to the whole XWiki installation and thus impacts
  its confidentiality, integrity and availability. The main problem is that if a wiki
  macro parameter allows wiki syntax, its default value is executed with the rights
  of the author of the document where it is used. This can be exploited by overriding
  a macro like the `children` macro that is used in a page that has programming right
  like the page `XWiki.ChildrenMacro` and thus allows arbitrary script macros. The
  full reproduction steps can be found in the [original issue](https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-22760)."
