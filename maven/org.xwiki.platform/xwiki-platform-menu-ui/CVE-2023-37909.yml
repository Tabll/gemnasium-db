package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-menu-ui"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command
  Injection')"
description: "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
  for applications built on top of it. Starting in version 5.1-rc-1 and prior to versions
  14.10.8 and 15.3-rc-1, any user who can edit their own user profile can execute
  arbitrary script macros including Groovy and Python macros that allow remote code
  execution including unrestricted read and write access to all wiki contents. This
  has been patched in XWiki 14.10.8 and 15.3-rc-1 by adding proper escaping. As a
  workaround, the patch can be manually applied to the document `Menu.UIExtensionSheet`;
  only three lines need to be changed."
