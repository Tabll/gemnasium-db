package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-mail-send-default"
title: "Improper Privilege Management"
description: "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in version 11.8-rc-1
  and prior to versions 14.4.8, 14.10.6, and 15.2, `Mail.MailConfig` can be edited
  by any logged-in user by default. Consequently, they can change the mail obfuscation
  configuration and view and edit the mail sending configuration, including the smtp
  domain name and credentials. The problem has been patched in XWiki 14.4.8, 14.10.6,
  and 15.1. As a workaround, the rights of the `Mail.MailConfig` page can be manually
  updated so that only a set of trusted users can view, edit and delete it (e.g.,
  the `XWiki.XWikiAdminGroup` group)."
