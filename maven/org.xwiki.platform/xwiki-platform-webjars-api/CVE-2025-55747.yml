title: "XWiki configuration files can be accessed through the webjars API"
description: "It's possible to get access and read configuration files by using URLs
  such as `http://localhost:8080/xwiki/webjars/wiki%3Axwiki/..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2FWEB-INF%2Fxwiki.cfg`.
  The trick here is to encode the / which is decoded when parsing the URL segment,
  but not re-encoded when assembling the file path."
