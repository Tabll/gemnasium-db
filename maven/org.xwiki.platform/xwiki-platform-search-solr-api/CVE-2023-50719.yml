package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-search-solr-api"
title: "Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in 7.2-milestone-2
  and prior to versions 14.10.15, 15.5.2, and 15.7-rc-1, the Solr-based search in
  XWiki discloses the password hashes of all users to anyone with view right on the
  respective user profiles. By default, all user profiles are public. This vulnerability
  also affects any configurations used by extensions that contain passwords like API
  keys that are viewable for the attacker. Normally, such passwords aren't accessible
  but this vulnerability would disclose them as plain text. This has been patched
  in XWiki 14.10.15, 15.5.2 and 15.7RC1. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n"
