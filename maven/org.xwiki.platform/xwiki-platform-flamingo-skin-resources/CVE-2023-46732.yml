package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-flamingo-skin-resources"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
  for applications built on top of it. XWiki is vulnerable to reflected cross-site
  scripting (RXSS) via the `rev` parameter that is used in the content of the content
  menu without escaping. If an attacker can convince a user to visit a link with a
  crafted parameter, this allows the attacker to execute arbitrary actions in the
  name of the user, including remote code (Groovy) execution in the case of a user
  with programming right, compromising the confidentiality, integrity and availability
  of the whole XWiki installation. This has been patched in XWiki 15.6 RC1, 15.5.1
  and 14.10.14. The patch in commit `04e325d57` can be manually applied without upgrading
  (or restarting) the instance. Users are advised to upgrade or to manually apply
  the patch. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
