title: "Improper Neutralization of Alternate XSS Syntax"
description: "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
  for applications built on top of it. Users are able to forge an URL with a payload
  allowing to inject Javascript in the page (XSS). It's possible to exploit the restore
  template to perform a XSS, e.g. by using URL such as: > 
  /xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/Main?xpage=restore&showBatch=true&xredirect=javascript:alert(document.domain).
  This vulnerability exists since XWiki 9.4-rc-1. The vulnerability has been patched
  in XWiki 14.10.5 and 15.1-rc-1. "
