title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
  for applications built on top of it. Users are able to forge an URL with a payload
  allowing to inject Javascript in the page (XSS). It's possible to exploit the delete
  template to perform a XSS, e.g. by using URL such as: > 
  xwiki/bin/get/FlamingoThemes/Cerulean?xpage=xpart&vm=delete.vm&xredirect=javascript:alert(document.domain).
  This vulnerability exists since XWiki 6.0-rc-1. The vulnerability has been patched
  in XWiki 14.10.6 and 15.1. Note that a partial patch has been provided in 14.10.5
  but wasn't enough to entirely fix the vulnerability. \n"
