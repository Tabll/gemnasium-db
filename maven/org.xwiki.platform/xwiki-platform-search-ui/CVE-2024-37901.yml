package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-search-ui"
title: "XWiki Platform vulnerable to remote code execution from account via SearchSuggestConfigSheet"
description: "Any user with edit right on any page can perform arbitrary remote code
  execution by adding instances of `XWiki.SearchSuggestConfig` and `XWiki.SearchSuggestSourceClass`
  to their user profile or any other page. This compromises the confidentiality, integrity
  and availability of the whole XWiki installation.\n\nTo reproduce on an instance,
  as a user without script nor programming rights, add an object of type `XWiki.SearchSuggestConfig`
  to your profile page, and an object of type `XWiki.SearchSuggestSourceClass` as
  well. On this last object, set both `name` and `icon` properties to `$services.logging.getLogger(\"attacker\").error(\"I
  got programming: $services.security.authorization.hasAccess('programming')\")` and
  `limit` and `engine` to `{{/html}}{{async}}{{velocity}}$services.logging.getLogger(\"attacker\").error(\"I
  got programming: $services.security.authorization.hasAccess('programming')\"){{/velocity}}{{/async}}`.
  Save and display the page. If the logs contain any message `ERROR attacker - I got
  programming: true` then the instance is vulnerable."
