package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-appwithinminutes"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
  for applications built on top of it. Any user who can create a space can become
  admin of that space through App Within Minutes. The admin right implies the script
  right and thus allows JavaScript injection. The vulnerability can be exploited by
  creating an app in App Within Minutes. If the button should be disabled because
  the user does not have global edit right, the app can also be created by directly
  opening `/xwiki/bin/view/AppWithinMinutes/CreateApplication?wizard=true` on the
  XWiki installation. This has been patched in XWiki 13.10.11, 14.4.8, 14.10.1 and
  15.0 RC1 by not granting the space admin right if the user does not have script
  right on the space where the app is created. Error message are displayed to warn
  the user that the app will be broken in this case. Users who became space admin
  through this vulnerability won't loose the space admin right due to the fix, so
  it is advised to check if all users who created AWM apps should keep their space
  admin rights. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
  vulnerability."
