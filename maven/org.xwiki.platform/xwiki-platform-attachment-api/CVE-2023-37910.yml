package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-attachment-api"
title: "org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-attachment-api vulnerable to Missing Authorization
  on Attachment Move"
description: "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
  for applications built on top of it. Starting with the introduction of attachment
  move support in version 14.0-rc-1 and prior to versions 14.4.8, 14.10.4, and 15.0-rc-1,
  an attacker with edit access on any document (can be the user profile which is editable
  by default) can move any attachment of any other document to this attacker-controlled
  document. This allows the attacker to access and possibly publish any attachment
  of which the name is known, regardless if the attacker has view or edit rights on
  the source document of this attachment. Further, the attachment is deleted from
  the source document. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 14.4.8, 14.10.4,
  and 15.0 RC1. There is no workaround apart from upgrading to a fixed version."
