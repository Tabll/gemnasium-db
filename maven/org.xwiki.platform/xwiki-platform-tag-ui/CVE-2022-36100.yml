package_slug: "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-tag-ui"
title: "Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')"
description: "XWiki Platform Applications Tag and XWiki Platform Tag UI are tag applications
  for XWiki, a generic wiki platform. Starting with version 1.7 in XWiki Platform
  Applications Tag and prior to 13.10.6 and 14.4 in XWiki Platform Tag UI, the tags
  document `Main.Tags` in XWiki didn't sanitize user inputs properly. This allowed
  users with view rights on the document (default in a public wiki or for authenticated
  users on private wikis) to execute arbitrary Groovy, Python and Velocity code with
  programming rights. This also allowed bypassing all rights checks and thus both
  modification and disclosure of all content stored in the XWiki installation. The
  vulnerability could be used to impact the availability of the wiki. On XWiki versions
  before 13.10.4 and 14.2, this can be combined with CVE-2022-36092, meaning that
  no rights are required to perform the attack. The vulnerability has been patched
  in versions 13.10.6 and 14.4. As a workaround, the patch that fixes the issue can
  be manually applied to the document `Main.Tags` or the updated version of that document
  can be imported from version 14.4 of xwiki-platform-tag-ui using the import feature
  in the administration UI on XWiki 10.9 and later."
