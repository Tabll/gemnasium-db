- "CVE-2023-41327"
package_slug: "maven/org.wiremock/wiremock-webhooks-extension"
title: "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
description: "WireMock is a tool for mocking HTTP services. WireMock can be configured
  to only permit proxying (and therefore recording) to certain addresses. This is
  achieved via a list of allowed address rules and a list of denied address rules,
  where the allowed list is evaluated first. \n\nUntil WireMock Webhooks Extension
  3.0.0-beta-15, the filtering of target addresses from the proxy mode DID NOT work
  for Webhooks, so the users were potentially vulnerable regardless of the `limitProxyTargets`
  settings. Via the WireMock webhooks configuration, POST requests from a webhook
  might be forwarded to an arbitrary service reachable from WireMockâ€™s instance. For
  example, If someone is running the WireMock docker Container inside a private cluster,
  they can trigger internal POST requests against unsecured APIs or even against secure
  ones by passing a token, discovered using another exploit, via authentication headers.
  This issue has been addressed in versions 2.35.1 and 3.0.3 of wiremock. Wiremock
  studio has been discontinued and will not see a fix. Users unable to upgrade should
  use external firewall rules to define the list of permitted destinations."
