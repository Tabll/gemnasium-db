title: "Ciphertext Malleability Issue in Tink Java"
description: "Tink's Java version before 1.5 under some circumstances allowed attackers
  to change the key ID part of the ciphertext, resulting in the attacker creating
  a second ciphertext that will decrypt to the same plaintext. This can be a problem
  in particular in the case of encrypting with a deterministic AEAD with a single
  key, and relying on the fact that there is only a single valid ciphertext per plaintext.\n\nNo
  loss of confidentiality or loss of plaintext integrity occurs due to this problem,
  only ciphertext integrity is compromised."
