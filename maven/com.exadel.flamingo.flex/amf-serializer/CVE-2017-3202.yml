package_slug: "maven/com.exadel.flamingo.flex/amf-serializer"
title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "The Java implementation of AMF3 deserializers used in Flamingo amf-serializer
  by Exadel, version 2.2.0, may allow instantiation of arbitrary classes via their
  public parameter-less constructor and subsequently call arbitrary Java Beans setter
  methods. The ability to exploit this vulnerability depends on the availability of
  classes in the class path that make use of deserialization. A remote attacker with
  the ability to spoof or control information may be able to send serialized Java
  objects with pre-set properties that result in arbitrary code execution when deserialized."
