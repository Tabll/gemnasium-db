description: "Jenkins 2.499 and earlier, LTS 2.492.1 and earlier does not redact encrypted
  values of secrets when accessing `config.xml` of agents via REST API or CLI.\n\nThis

  secrets.\n\nJenkins 2.500, LTS 2.492.2 redacts the encrypted values of secrets stored
  in agent `config.xml` accessed via REST API or CLI for users lacking Agent/Configure
  permission."
