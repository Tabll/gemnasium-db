title: "Jenkins cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability"
description: "Jenkins 2.499 and earlier, LTS 2.492.1 and earlier does not require
  POST requests for the HTTP endpoint toggling collapsed/expanded status of sidepanel
  widgets (e.g., Build Queue and Build Executor Status widgets), resulting in a cross-site
  request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.\n\nThis vulnerability allows attackers to
  have users toggle their collapsed/expanded status of sidepanel widgets.\n\nAdditionally,
  as the API accepts any string as the identifier of the panel ID to be toggled, attacker-controlled
  content can be stored in the victimâ€™s user profile in Jenkins.\n\nJenkins 2.500,
  LTS 2.492.2 requires POST requests for the affected HTTP endpoint."
