title: "Jenkins does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint"
description: "Jenkins 2.470 and earlier, LTS 2.452.3 and earlier does not perform
  a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.\n\nThis allows attackers with Overall/Read
  permission to access other users' \"My Views\". Attackers with global View/Configure
  and View/Delete permissions are also able to change other users' \"My Views\".\n\nJenkins
  2.471, LTS 2.452.4, LTS 2.462.1 restricts access to a userâ€™s \"My Views\" to the
  owning user and administrators."
