title: "Jenkins Missing Permission Check"
description: "Jenkins 2.503 and earlier, LTS 2.492.2 and earlier does not perform
  a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.\n\nThis allows attackers with Computer/Create
  permission but without Computer/Configure permission to copy an agent, gaining access
  to encrypted secrets in its configuration.\n\nThis is due to an incomplete fix of
  [SECURITY-3495](https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2025-03-05/#SECURITY-3495)/CVE-2025-27622.\n\nJenkins
  2.504, LTS 2.492.3 requires Computer/Configure permission to copy an agent containing
  secrets."
