title: "Jenkins Open Redirect vulnerability "
description: "Various features in Jenkins redirect users to partially user-controlled
  URLs inside Jenkins. To prevent open redirect vulnerabilities, Jenkins limits redirections
  to safe URLs (neither absolute nor scheme-relative/network-path reference).\n\nIn
  Jenkins 2.499 and earlier, LTS 2.492.1 and earlier, redirects starting with backslash
  (`\\`) characters are considered safe.\n\nThis allows attackers to perform phishing
  attacks by having users go to a Jenkins URL that will forward them to a different
  site, because browsers interpret these characters as part of scheme-relative redirects.\n\nJenkins
  2.500, LTS 2.492.2 considers redirects to URLs starting with backslash (`\\`) characters
  to be unsafe, rejecting such redirects."
