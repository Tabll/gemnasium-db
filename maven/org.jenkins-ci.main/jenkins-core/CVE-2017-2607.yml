title: "Cross-site Scripting"
description: "Jenkins is vulnerable to a persisted cross-site scripting vulnerability
  in console notes. Jenkins allows plugins to annotate build logs, adding new content
  or changing the presentation of existing content while the build is running. Malicious
  Jenkins users, or users with SCM access, could configure jobs or modify build scripts
  such that they print serialized console notes that perform cross-site scripting
  attacks on Jenkins users viewing the build logs."
