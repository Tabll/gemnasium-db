title: "Integer Overflow or Wraparound"
description: "Eclipse Jetty provides a web server and servlet container. In versions
  11.0.0 through 11.0.15, 10.0.0 through 10.0.15, and 9.0.0 through 9.4.52, an integer
  overflow in `MetaDataBuilder.checkSize` allows for HTTP/2 HPACK header values to\nexceed
  their size limit. `MetaDataBuilder.java` determines if a header name or value exceeds
  the size limit, and throws an exception if the limit is exceeded. However, when
  length is very large and huffman is true, the multiplication by 4 in line 295\nwill
  overflow, and length will become negative. `(_size+length)` will now be negative,
  and the check on line 296 will not be triggered. Furthermore, `MetaDataBuilder.checkSize`
  allows for user-entered HPACK header value sizes to be negative, potentially leading
  to a very large buffer allocation later on when the user-entered size is multiplied
  by 2. This means that if a user provides a negative length value (or, more precisely,
  a length value which, when multiplied by the 4/3 fudge factor, is negative), and
  this length value is a very large positive number when multiplied by 2, then the
  user can cause a very large buffer to be allocated on the server. Users of HTTP/2
  can be impacted by a remote denial of service attack. The issue has been fixed in
  versions 11.0.16, 10.0.16, and 9.4.53. There are no known workarounds."
