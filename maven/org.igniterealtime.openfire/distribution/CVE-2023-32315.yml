title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "Openfire is an XMPP server licensed under the Open Source Apache License.
  Openfire's administrative console, a web-based application, was found to be vulnerable
  to a path traversal attack via the setup environment. This permitted an unauthenticated
  user to use the unauthenticated Openfire Setup Environment in an already configured
  Openfire environment to access restricted pages in the Openfire Admin Console reserved
  for administrative users. This vulnerability affects all versions of Openfire that
  have been released since April 2015, starting with version 3.10.0. The problem has
  been patched in Openfire release 4.7.5 and 4.6.8, and further improvements will
  be included in the yet-to-be released first version on the 4.8 branch (which is
  expected to be version 4.8.0). Users are advised to upgrade. If an Openfire upgrade
  isn’t available for a specific release, or isn’t quickly actionable, users may see
  the linked github advisory (GHSA-gw42-f939-fhvm) for mitigation advice."
