title: "Apache Ambari XML External Entity injection"
description: "XML External Entity injection in Apache Ambari versions <= 2.7.7,Â Users
  are recommended to upgrade to version 2.7.8, which fixes this issue.\n\nMore Details:\n\nOozie
  Workflow Scheduler had a vulnerability that allowed for root-level file reading
  and privilege escalation from low-privilege users. The vulnerability was caused
  through lack of proper user input validation.\n\nThis vulnerability is known as
  an XML External Entity (XXE) injection attack. Attackers can exploit XXE vulnerabilities
  to read arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive system files. In theory,
  it might be possible to use this to escalate privileges."
