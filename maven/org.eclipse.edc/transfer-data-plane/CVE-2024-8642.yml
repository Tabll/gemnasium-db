title: "Eclipse Dataspace Components's ConsumerPullTransferTokenValidationApiController
  doesn't check for token validit"
description: "In Eclipse Dataspace Components, from version 0.5.0 and before version
  0.9.0, the ConsumerPullTransferTokenValidationApiController does not check for token
  validity (expiry, not-before, issuance date), which can allow an attacker to bypass
  the check for token expiration. The issue requires to have a dataplane configured
  to support http proxy consumer pull AND include the module \"transfer-data-plane\".
  The affected code was marked deprecated from the version 0.6.0 in favour of Dataplane
  Signaling. In 0.9.0 the vulnerable code has been removed."
