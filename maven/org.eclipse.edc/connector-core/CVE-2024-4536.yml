title: "Eclipse Dataspace Components vulnerable to OAuth2 client secret disclosure"
description: "In Eclipse Dataspace Components from version 0.2.1 to 0.6.2, in the
  [EDC Connector component](https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Connector), an attacker
  might obtain OAuth2 client secrets from the vault.\n\nIn Eclipse Dataspace Components
  from version 0.2.1 to 0.6.2, we have identified a security vulnerability in the
  EDC Connector component ( https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Connector ) regarding the
  OAuth2-protected data sink feature. When using a custom, OAuth2-protected data sink,
  the OAuth2-specific data address properties are resolved by the provider data plane.
  Problematically, the consumer-provided clientSecretKey, which indicates the OAuth2
  client secret to retrieve from a secrets vault, is resolved in the context of the
  provider's vault, not the consumer. This secret's value is then sent to the tokenUrl,
  also consumer-controlled, as part of an OAuth2 client credentials grant. The returned
  access token is then sent as a bearer token to the data sink URL.\n\nThis feature
  is now disabled entirely, because not all code paths necessary for a successful
  realization were fully implemented."
