title: "Jenkins Apica Loadtest Plugin vulnerability exposes authentication tokens"
description: "Jenkins Apica Loadtest Plugin 1.10 and earlier stores Apica Loadtest
  LTP authentication tokens unencrypted in job config.xml files on the Jenkins controller
  as part of its configuration.\n\nThese tokens can be viewed by users with Item/Extended
  Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.\n\nAdditionally,
  the job configuration form does not mask these tokens, increasing the potential
  for attackers to observe and capture them.\n\nAs of publication of this advisory,
  there is no fix."
