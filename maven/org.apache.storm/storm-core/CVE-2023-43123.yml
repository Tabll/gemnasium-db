title: "Apache Storm Local Information Disclosure Vulnerability in Storm-core on Unix-Like
  systems due temporary files "
description: "On unix-like systems, the temporary directory is shared between all
  user. As such, writing to this directory using APIs that do not explicitly set the
  file/directory permissions can lead to information disclosure. Of note, this does
  not impact modern MacOS Operating Systems.\n\nThe method File.createTempFile on
  unix-like systems creates a file with predefined name (so easily identifiable) and
  by default will create this file with the permissions -rw-r--r--. Thus, if sensitive
  information is written to this file, other local users can read this information.\n\nFile.createTempFile(String,
  String) will create a temporary file in the system temporary directory if the 'java.io.tmpdir'
  system property is not explicitly set."
