title: "Validator.isValidSafeHTML is being deprecated and will be deleted from org.owasp.esapi:esapi
  in 1 year"
description: "The `Validator.isValidSafeHTML` method can result in false negatives
  where it reports some input as safe (i.e., returns true), but really isn't, and
  using that same input as-is can in certain circumstances result in XSS vulnerabilities.
  Because this method cannot be fixed, it is being deprecated and will be removed
  in one years time from when this advisory is published. Full details may be found
  in [ESAPI Security Bulletin #12](https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/blob/develop/documentation/ESAPI-security-bulletin12.pdf).\n\nNote
  that all versions of ESAPI, that have this method (which dates back to at least
  the ESAPI 1.3 release more than 15 years ago) have this issue and it will continue
  to exist until we remove these two methods in a future ESAPI release."
