title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "ESAPI (The OWASP Enterprise Security API) is a free, open source, web
  application security control library. Prior to version 2.3.0.0, there is a potential
  for a cross-site scripting vulnerability in ESAPI caused by a incorrect regular
  expression for `onsiteURL` in the **antisamy-esapi.xml** configuration file that
  can cause `javascript:` URLs to fail to be correctly sanitized. This issue is
  patched in ESAPI 2.3.0.0. As a workaround, manually edit the **antisamy-esapi.xml**
  configuration files to change the `onsiteURL` regular expression. More information
  about remediation of the vulnerability, including the workaround, is available in
  the maintainers' release notes and security bulletin."
