package_slug: "maven/org.apache.geode/geode-core"
title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "Apache Geode versions up to 1.12.5, 1.13.4 and 1.14.0 is vulnerable
  to a deserialization of untrusted data flaw when using JMX over RMI on Java 8. Any
  user still on Java 8 who wishes to protect against deserialization attacks involving
  JMX or RMI should upgrade to Apache Geode 1.15 and Java 11. If upgrading to Java
  11 is not possible, then upgrade to Apache Geode 1.15 and specify \"--J=-Dgeode.enableGlobalSerialFilter=true\"
  when starting any Locators or Servers. Follow the documentation for details on specifying
  any user classes that may be serialized/deserialized with the \"serializable-object-filter\"
  configuration option. Using a global serial filter will impact performance."
