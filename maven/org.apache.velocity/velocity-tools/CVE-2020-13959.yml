description: "The default error page for VelocityView in Apache Velocity Tools prior
  to 3.1 reflects back the vm file that was entered as part of the URL. An attacker
  can set an XSS payload file as this vm file in the URL which results in this payload
  being executed. XSS vulnerabilities allow attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript
  in the context of the attacked website and the attacked user. This can be abused
  to steal session cookies, perform requests in the name of the victim or for phishing
  attacks."
