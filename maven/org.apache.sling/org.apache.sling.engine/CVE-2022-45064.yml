description: "The SlingRequestDispatcher does not correctly implement the RequestDispatcher
  API resulting in a generic type of include-based cross-site scripting issues on
  the Apache Sling level. The vulnerability is exploitable by an attacker that is
  able to include a resource with specific content-type and control the include path
  (i.e. writing content). The impact of a successful attack is privilege escalation
  to administrative power.\n\n\n\n\nPlease update to Apache Sling Engine >= 2.14.0
  and enable the \"Check Content-Type overrides\" configuration option.\n\n\n\n\n"
