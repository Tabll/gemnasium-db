identifier: "CVE-2017-2666"
package_slug: "maven/io.undertow/undertow-core"
title: "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests (HTTP Request Smuggling)"
description: "It was discovered in Undertow that the code that parses the HTTP request
  line permitted invalid characters. This could be exploited, in conjunction with
  a proxy that also permitted the invalid characters but with a different interpretation,
  to inject data into the HTTP response. By manipulating the HTTP response the attacker
  could poison a web-cache, perform an XSS attack, or obtain sensitive information
  from requests other than their own."
