title: "Undertow HTTP server core doesn't properly validate the Host header in incoming
  HTTP requests"
description: "A flaw was found in the Undertow HTTP server core, which is used in
  WildFly, JBoss EAP, and other Java applications. The Undertow library fails to properly
  validate the Host header in incoming HTTP requests. As a result, requests containing
  malformed or malicious Host headers are processed without rejection, enabling attackers
  to poison caches, perform internal network scans, or hijack user sessions."
