title: "Undertow Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability"
description: "A vulnerability was found in Undertow. This issue requires enabling
  the learning-push handler in the server's config, which is disabled by default,
  leaving the maxAge config in the handler unconfigured. The default is -1, which
  makes the handler vulnerable. If someone overwrites that config, the server is not
  subject to the attack. The attacker needs to be able to reach the server with a
  normal HTTP request."
