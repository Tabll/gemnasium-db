title: "Undertow Uncontrolled Resource Consumption Vulnerability"
description: "A vulnerability was found in Undertow. This vulnerability impacts a
  server that supports the wildfly-http-client protocol. Whenever a malicious user
  opens and closes a connection with the HTTP port of the server and then closes the
  connection immediately, the server will end with both memory and open file limits
  exhausted at some point, depending on the amount of memory available.\n\nAt HTTP
  upgrade to remoting, the WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit leaks connections if RemotingConnection
  is closed by Remoting ServerConnectionOpenListener. Because the remoting connection
  originates in Undertow as part of the HTTP upgrade, there is an external layer to
  the remoting connection. This connection is unaware of the outermost layer when
  closing the connection during the connection opening procedure. Hence, the Undertow
  WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit is not notified of the closed connection in this scenario.
  Because WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit creates a timeout task, the whole dependency
  tree leaks via that task, which is added to XNIO WorkerThread. So, the workerThread
  points to the Undertow conduit, which contains the connections and causes the leak."
