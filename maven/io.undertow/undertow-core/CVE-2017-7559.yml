identifier: "CVE-2017-7559"
package_slug: "maven/io.undertow/undertow-core"
title: "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests (HTTP Request Smuggling)"
description: "Invalid characters are allowed in query strings and path parameters.
  This could be exploited, in conjunction with a proxy that also permitted the invalid
  characters but with a different interpretation, to inject data into the HTTP response.
  By manipulating the HTTP response the attacker could poison a web-cache, perform
  an XSS attack, or obtain sensitive information from requests other than their own."
