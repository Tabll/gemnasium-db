title: "Undertow MadeYouReset HTTP/2 DDoS Vulnerability"
description: "A flaw was found in Undertow where malformed client requests can trigger
  server-side stream resets without triggering abuse counters. This issue, referred
  to as the \"MadeYouReset\" attack, allows malicious clients to induce excessive
  server workload by repeatedly causing server-side stream aborts. While not a protocol
  bug, this highlights a common implementation weakness that can be exploited to cause
  a denial of service (DoS)."
