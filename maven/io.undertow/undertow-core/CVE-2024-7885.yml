package_slug: "maven/io.undertow/undertow-core"
title: "Undertow vulnerable to Race Condition"
description: "A vulnerability was found in Undertow where the ProxyProtocolReadListener
  reuses the same StringBuilder instance across multiple requests. This issue occurs
  when the parseProxyProtocolV1 method processes multiple requests on the same HTTP
  connection. As a result, different requests may share the same StringBuilder instance,
  potentially leading to information leakage between requests or responses. In some
  cases, a value from a previous request or response may be erroneously reused, which
  could lead to unintended data exposure. This issue primarily results in errors and
  connection termination but creates a risk of data leakage in multi-request environments."
