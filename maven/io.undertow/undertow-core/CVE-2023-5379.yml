package_slug: "maven/io.undertow/undertow-core"
title: "Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling"
description: "A flaw was found in Undertow. When an AJP request is sent that exceeds
  the max-header-size attribute in ajp-listener, JBoss EAP is marked in an error state
  by mod_cluster in httpd, causing JBoss EAP to close the TCP connection without returning
  an AJP response. This happens because mod_proxy_cluster marks the JBoss EAP instance
  as an error worker when the TCP connection is closed from the backend after sending
  the AJP request without receiving an AJP response, and stops forwarding. This issue
  could allow a malicious user could to repeatedly send requests that exceed the max-header-size,
  causing a Denial of Service (DoS)."
