package_slug: "maven/io.undertow/undertow-core"
title: "Unchecked Return Value"
description: "A flaw was found in Undertow. For an AJP 400 response, EAP 7 is improperly
  sending two response packets, and those packets have the reuse flag set even though
  JBoss EAP closes the connection. A failure occurs when the connection is reused
  after a 400 by CPING since it reads in the second SEND_HEADERS response packet instead
  of a CPONG."
