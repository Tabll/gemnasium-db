package_slug: "maven/org.apache.hadoop/hadoop-common"
title: "Apache Hadoop: Temporary File Local Information Disclosure"
description: "Apache Hadoop’s `RunJar.run()` does not set permissions for temporary
  directory by default. If sensitive data will be present in this file, all the other
  local users may be able to view the content. This is because, on unix-like systems,
  the system temporary directory is shared between all local users. As such, files
  written in this directory, without setting the correct posix permissions explicitly,
  may be viewable by all other local users."
