title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data in Apache Hadoop YARN"

  Apache Hadoop YARN deserializes data obtained from ZooKeeper without validation.
  An attacker having access to ZooKeeper can run arbitrary commands as YARN user by
  exploiting this. Users should upgrade to Apache Hadoop 2.10.2, 3.2.4, 3.3.4 or later
  (containing YARN-11126) if ZKConfigurationStore is used."
