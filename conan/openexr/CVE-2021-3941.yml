identifiers:
- "CVE-2021-3941"
package_slug: "conan/openexr"
title: "Divide By Zero"
description: "In ImfChromaticities.cpp routine RGBtoXYZ(), there are some division
  operations such as `float Z = (1 - chroma.white.x - chroma.white.y) * Y / chroma.white.y;`
  and `chroma.green.y * (X + Z))) / d;` but the divisor is not checked for a 0 value.
  A specially crafted file could trigger a divide-by-zero condition which could affect
  the availability of programs linked with OpenEXR."
