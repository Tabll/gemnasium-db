package_slug: "conan/wolfssl"
title: "Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions"
description: "An issue was discovered in wolfSSL before 5.5.0. When a TLS 1.3 client
  connects to a wolfSSL server and SSL_clear is called on its session, the server
  crashes with a segmentation fault. This occurs in the second session, which is created
  through TLS session resumption and reuses the initial struct WOLFSSL. If the server
  reuses the previous session structure (struct WOLFSSL) by calling wolfSSL_clear(WOLFSSL*
  ssl) on it, the next received Client Hello (that resumes the previous session) crashes
  the server. Note that this bug is only triggered when resuming sessions using TLS
  session resumption. Only servers that use wolfSSL_clear instead of the recommended
  SSL_free; SSL_new sequence are affected. Furthermore, wolfSSL_clear is part of wolfSSL's
  compatibility layer and is not enabled by default. It is not part of wolfSSL's native
  API."
