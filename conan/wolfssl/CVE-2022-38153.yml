package_slug: "conan/wolfssl"
title: "Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling"
description: "An issue was discovered in wolfSSL before 5.5.0 (when --enable-session-ticket
  is used); however, only version 5.3.0 is exploitable. Man-in-the-middle attackers
  or a malicious server can crash TLS 1.2 clients during a handshake. If an attacker
  injects a large ticket (more than 256 bytes) into a NewSessionTicket message in
  a TLS 1.2 handshake, and the client has a non-empty session cache, the session cache
  frees a pointer that points to unallocated memory, causing the client to crash with
  a \"free(): invalid pointer\" message. NOTE: It is likely that this is also exploitable
  during TLS 1.3 handshakes between a client and a malicious server. With TLS 1.3,
  it is not possible to exploit this as a man-in-the-middle."
