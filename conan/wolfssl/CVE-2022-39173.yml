package_slug: "conan/wolfssl"
title: "Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')"
description: "In wolfSSL before 5.5.1, malicious clients can cause a buffer overflow
  during a TLS 1.3 handshake. This occurs when an attacker supposedly resumes a previous
  TLS session. During the resumption Client Hello a Hello Retry Request must be triggered.
  Both Client Hellos are required to contain a list of duplicate cipher suites to
  trigger the buffer overflow. In total, two Client Hellos have to be sent: one in
  the resumed session, and a second one as a response to a Hello Retry Request message."
