identifiers:
- "CVE-2022-42961"
package_slug: "conan/wolfssl"
title: "ECDSA key disclosure"
description: "An issue was discovered in wolfSSL before 5.5.0. A fault injection attack
  on RAM via Rowhammer leads to ECDSA key disclosure. Users performing signing operations
  with private ECC keys, such as in server-side TLS connections, might leak faulty
  ECC signatures. These signatures can be processed via an advanced technique for
  ECDSA key recovery. (In 5.5.0 and later, `WOLFSSL_CHECK_SIG_FAULTS` can be used to
  address the vulnerability.)"
