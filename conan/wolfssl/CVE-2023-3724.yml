identifiers:
- "CVE-2023-3724"
package_slug: "conan/wolfssl"
title: "Improper Certificate Validation"
description: "If a TLS 1.3 client gets neither a PSK (pre shared key) extension nor
  a KSE (key share extension) when connecting to a malicious server, a default predictable
  buffer gets used for the IKM (Input Keying Material) value when generating the session
  master secret. Using a potentially known IKM value when generating the session master
  secret key compromises the key generated, allowing an eavesdropper to reconstruct
  it and potentially allowing access to or meddling with message contents in the session.
  This issue does not affect client validation of connected servers, nor expose private
  key information, but could result in an insecure TLS 1.3 session when not controlling
  both sides of the connection. wolfSSL recommends that TLS 1.3 client side users
  update the version of wolfSSL used.Â \n\n\n"
