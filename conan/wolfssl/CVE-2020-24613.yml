package_slug: "conan/wolfssl"
title: "Improper Certificate Validation"
description: "wolfSSL mishandles TLS server data in the `WAIT_CERT_CR` state, within
  `SanityCheckTls13MsgReceived()` in `tls13.c`. This is an incorrect implementation
  of the TLS client state machine. This allows attackers in a privileged network position
  to completely impersonate any TLS servers, and read or modify potentially sensitive
  information between clients using the wolfSSL library and these TLS servers."
