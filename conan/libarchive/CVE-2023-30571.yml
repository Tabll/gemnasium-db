identifiers:
- "CVE-2023-30571"
package_slug: "conan/libarchive"
title: "Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race
  Condition')"
description: "Libarchive through 3.6.2 can cause directories to have world-writable
  permissions. The umask() call inside archive_write_disk_posix.c changes the umask
  of the whole process for a very short period of time; a race condition with another
  thread can lead to a permanent umask 0 setting. Such a race condition could lead
  to implicit directory creation with permissions 0777 (without the sticky bit), which
  means that any low-privileged local user can delete and rename files inside those
  directories."
