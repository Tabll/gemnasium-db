package_slug: "conan/libarchive"
title: "NULL Pointer Dereference"
description: "In libarchive 3.6.1, the software does not check for an error after
  calling calloc function that can return with a NULL pointer if the function fails,
  which leads to a resultant NULL pointer dereference. NOTE: the discoverer cites
  this CWE-476 remark but third parties dispute the code-execution impact: \"In rare
  circumstances, when NULL is equivalent to the 0x0 memory address and privileged
  code can access it, then writing or reading memory is possible, which may lead to
  code execution.\""
