identifier: "CVE-2020-6750"
package_slug: "conan/glib"
title: "Information Exposure"
description: "`GSocketClient` in GNOME GLib may occasionally connect directly to a
  target address instead of connecting via a proxy server when configured to do so,
  because the `proxy_addr` field is mishandled. This bug is timing-dependent and may
  occur only sporadically depending on network delays. The greatest security relevance
  is in use cases where a proxy is used to help with privacy/anonymity, even though
  there is no technical barrier to a direct connection."
