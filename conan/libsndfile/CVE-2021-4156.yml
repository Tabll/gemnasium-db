package_slug: "conan/libsndfile"
title: "Out-of-bounds Read"
description: "An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in libsndfile's FLAC codec functionality.
  An attacker who is able to submit a specially crafted file (via tricking a user
  to open or otherwise) to an application linked with libsndfile and using the FLAC
  codec, could trigger an out-of-bounds read that would most likely cause a crash
  but could potentially leak memory information that could be used in further exploitation
  of other flaws."
