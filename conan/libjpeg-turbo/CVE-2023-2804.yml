package_slug: "conan/libjpeg-turbo"
title: "Out-of-bounds Write"
description: "A heap-based buffer overflow issue was discovered in libjpeg-turbo in
  h2v2_merged_upsample_internal() function of jdmrgext.c file. The vulnerability can
  only be exploited with 12-bit data precision for which the range of the sample data
  type exceeds the valid sample range, hence, an attacker could craft a 12-bit lossless
  JPEG image that contains out-of-range 12-bit samples. An application attempting
  to decompress such image using merged upsampling would lead to segmentation fault
  or buffer overflows, causing an application to crash."
