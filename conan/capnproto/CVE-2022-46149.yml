package_slug: "conan/capnproto"
title: "Out-of-bounds Read"
description: "Cap'n Proto is a data interchange format and remote procedure call (RPC)
  system. Cap'n Proro prior to versions 0.7.1, 0.8.1, 0.9.2, and 0.10.3, as well as
  versions of Cap'n Proto's Rust implementation prior to 0.13.7, 0.14.11, and 0.15.2
  is vulnerable to out-of-bounds read due to logic error handling list-of-list. This
  issue may lead someone to remotely segfault a peer by sending it a malicious message,
  if the victim performs certain actions on a list-of-pointer type. Exfiltration of
  memory is possible if the victim performs additional certain actions on a list-of-pointer
  type. To be vulnerable, an application must perform a specific sequence of actions,
  described in the GitHub Security Advisory. The bug is present in inlined code, therefore
  the fix will require rebuilding dependent applications. Cap'n Proto has C++ fixes
  available in versions 0.7.1, 0.8.1, 0.9.2, and 0.10.3. The `capnp` Rust crate has
  fixes available in versions 0.13.7, 0.14.11, and 0.15.2."
