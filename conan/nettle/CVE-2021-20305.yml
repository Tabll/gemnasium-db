identifier: "CVE-2021-20305"
package_slug: "conan/nettle"
title: "Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm"
description: "A flaw was found in Nettle, where several Nettle signature verification
  functions (GOST DSA, EDDSA & ECDSA) result in the Elliptic Curve Cryptography point
  (ECC) multiply function being called with out-of-range scalers, possibly resulting
  in incorrect results. This flaw allows an attacker to force an invalid signature,
  causing an assertion failure or possible validation. The highest threat to this
  vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability."
