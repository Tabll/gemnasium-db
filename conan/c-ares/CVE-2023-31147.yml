package_slug: "conan/c-ares"
title: "Use of Insufficiently Random Values"
description: "c-ares is an asynchronous resolver library. When /dev/urandom or RtlGenRandom()
  are unavailable, c-ares uses rand() to generate random numbers used for DNS query
  ids. This is not a CSPRNG, and it is also not seeded by srand() so will generate
  predictable output. Input from the random number generator is fed into a non-compilant
  RC4 implementation and may not be as strong as the original RC4 implementation.
  No attempt is made to look for modern OS-provided CSPRNGs like arc4random() that
  is widely available. This issue has been fixed in version 1.19.1."
