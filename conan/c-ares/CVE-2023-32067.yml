package_slug: "conan/c-ares"
title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "c-ares is an asynchronous resolver library. c-ares is vulnerable to
  denial of service. If a target resolver sends a query, the attacker forges a malformed
  UDP packet with a length of 0 and returns them to the target resolver. The target
  resolver erroneously interprets the 0 length as a graceful shutdown of the connection.
  This issue has been patched in version 1.19.1."
