package_slug: "conan/c-ares"
title: "Use of Insufficiently Random Values"
description: "c-ares is an asynchronous resolver library. When cross-compiling c-ares
  and using the autotools build system, CARES_RANDOM_FILE will not be set, as seen
  when cross compiling aarch64 android. This will downgrade to using rand() as a fallback
  which could allow an attacker to take advantage of the lack of entropy by not using
  a CSPRNG. This issue was patched in version 1.19.1.\n"
