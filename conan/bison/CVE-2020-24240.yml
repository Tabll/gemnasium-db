identifier: "CVE-2020-24240"
package_slug: "conan/bison"
title: "Use After Free"
description: "GNU Bison has a use-after-free in `_obstack_free` in `lib/obstack.c` (called
  from gram_lex) when a '\\0' byte is encountered. NOTE: there is a risk only if Bison
  is used with untrusted input, and the observed bug happens to cause unsafe behavior
  with a specific compiler/architecture. The bug report was intended to show that
  a crash may occur in Bison itself, not that a crash may occur in code that is generated
  by Bison."
