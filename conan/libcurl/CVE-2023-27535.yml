package_slug: "conan/libcurl"
title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in libcurl <8.0.0 in the
  FTP connection reuse feature that can result in wrong credentials being used during
  subsequent transfers. Previously created connections are kept in a connection pool
  for reuse if they match the current setup. However, certain FTP settings such as
  CURLOPT_FTP_ACCOUNT, CURLOPT_FTP_ALTERNATIVE_TO_USER, CURLOPT_FTP_SSL_CCC, and CURLOPT_USE_SSL
  were not included in the configuration match checks, causing them to match too easily.
  This could lead to libcurl using the wrong credentials when performing a transfer,
  potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information."
