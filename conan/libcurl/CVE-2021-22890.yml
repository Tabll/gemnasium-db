identifier: "CVE-2021-22890"
package_slug: "conan/libcurl"
title: "Authentication Bypass by Spoofing"
description: "curl to and including includes vulnerability that allows a malicious
  HTTPS proxy to MITM a connection due to bad handling of TLS session tickets. When
  using a HTTPS proxy and TLS, libcurl can confuse session tickets arriving from the
  HTTPS proxy but work as if they arrived from the remote server and then wrongly
  \"short-cut\" the host handshake. When confusing the tickets, a HTTPS proxy can
  trick libcurl to use the wrong session ticket resume for the host and thereby circumvent
  the server TLS certificate check and make a MITM attack to be possible to perform
  unnoticed. Note that such a malicious HTTPS proxy needs to provide a certificate
  that curl will accept for the MITMed server for an attack to work - unless curl
  has been told to ignore the server certificate check."
