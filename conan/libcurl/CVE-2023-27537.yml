description: "A double free vulnerability exists in libcurl <8.0.0 when sharing HSTS
  data between separate \"handles\". This sharing was introduced without considerations
  for do this sharing across separate threads but there was no indication of this
  fact in the documentation. Due to missing mutexes or thread locks, two threads sharing
  the same HSTS data could end up doing a double-free or use-after-free."
