package_slug: "conan/libcurl"
title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "An authentication bypass vulnerability exists libcurl <8.0.0 in the
  connection reuse feature which can reuse previously established connections with
  incorrect user permissions due to a failure to check for changes in the CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION
  option. This vulnerability affects krb5/kerberos/negotiate/GSSAPI transfers and
  could potentially result in unauthorized access to sensitive information. The safest
  option is to not reuse connections if the CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION option has been
  changed."
