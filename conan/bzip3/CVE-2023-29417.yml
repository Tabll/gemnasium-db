title: "Out-of-bounds Read"
description: "An issue was discovered in libbzip3.a in bzip3 1.2.2. There is a bz3_decompress
  out-of-bounds read in certain situations where buffers passed to bzip3 do not contain
  enough space to be filled with decompressed data. NOTE: the vendor's perspective
  is that the observed behavior can only occur for a contract violation, and thus
  the report is invalid."
