identifiers:
- "CVE-2022-1473"
package_slug: "conan/openssl"
title: "Improper Resource Shutdown or Release"
description: "The `OPENSSL_LH_flush()` function, which empties a hash table, contains
  a bug that breaks reuse of the memory occuppied by the removed hash table entries.
  This function is used when decoding certificates or keys. If a long lived process
  periodically decodes certificates or keys its memory usage will expand without bounds
  and the process might be terminated by the operating system causing a denial of
  service. Also traversing the empty hash table entries will take increasingly more
  time. Typically such long lived processes might be TLS clients or TLS servers configured
  to accept client certificate authentication."
