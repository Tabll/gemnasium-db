package_slug: "conan/openssl"
title: "NULL Pointer Dereference"
description: "An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an application
  tries to load malformed PKCS7 data with the d2i_PKCS7(), d2i_PKCS7_bio() or d2i_PKCS7_fp()
  functions. The result of the dereference is an application crash which could lead
  to a denial of service attack. The TLS implementation in OpenSSL does not call this
  function however third party applications might call these functions on untrusted
  data."
