- "CVE-2022-4203"
package_slug: "conan/openssl"
title: "Out-of-bounds Read"
description: "A read buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification,
  specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate
  chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious
  certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite
  failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. The read buffer overrun might result
  in a crash which could lead to a denial of service attack. In theory it could also
  result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive
  plaintext) although we are not aware of any working exploit leading to memory contents
  disclosure as of the time of release of this advisory. In a TLS client, this can
  be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered
  if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects."
