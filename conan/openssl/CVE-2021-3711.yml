title: "Buffer Overflow"
description: "In order to decrypt SM2 encrypted data an application is expected to
  call the API function `EVP_PKEY_decrypt()`. Typically an application will call this
  function twice. The first time, on entry, the `out` parameter can be NULL and, on
  exit, the `outlen` parameter is populated with the buffer size required to hold
  the decrypted plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufficiently sized
  buffer and call `EVP_PKEY_decrypt()` again, but this time passing a non-NULL value
  for the `out` parameter. A bug in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code
  means that the calculation of the buffer size required to hold the plaintext returned
  by the first call to `EVP_PKEY_decrypt()` can be smaller than the actual size required
  by the second call. This can lead to a buffer overflow when `EVP_PKEY_decrypt()`
  is called by the application a second time with a buffer that is too small. A malicious
  attacker who is able present SM2 content for decryption to an application could
  cause attacker chosen data to overflow the buffer by up to a maximum of bytes altering
  the contents of other data held after the buffer, possibly changing application
  behaviour or causing the application to crash. The location of the buffer is application
  dependent but is typically heap allocated."
