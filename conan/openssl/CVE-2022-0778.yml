package_slug: "conan/openssl"
title: "Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')"
description: "The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains
  a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function
  is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed
  form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed
  form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that
  has invalid explicit curve parameters"
