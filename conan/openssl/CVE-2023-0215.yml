title: "Use After Free"
description: "The public API function BIO_new_NDEF is a helper function used for streaming
  ASN.1 data via a BIO. It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the
  SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by
  end user applications. The function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new
  BIO_f_asn1 filter BIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns
  the new head of the BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example
  if a CMS recipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function
  returns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain
  is not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains internal
  pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on to call
  BIO_pop() on the BIO then a use-after-free will occur. This will most likely result
  in a crash. This scenario occurs directly in the internal function B64_write_ASN1()
  which may cause BIO_new_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call BIO_pop()
  on the BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions
  PEM_write_bio_ASN1_stream, PEM_write_bio_CMS_stream, PEM_write_bio_PKCS7_stream,
  SMIME_write_ASN1, SMIME_write_CMS and SMIME_write_PKCS7. Other public API functions
  that may be impacted by this include i2d_ASN1_bio_stream, BIO_new_CMS, BIO_new_PKCS7,
  i2d_CMS_bio_stream and i2d_PKCS7_bio_stream. The OpenSSL cms and smime command line
  applications are similarly affected."
