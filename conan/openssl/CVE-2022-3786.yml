title: "X.509 Email Address Variable Length Buffer Overflow"
description: "A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification,
  specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate
  chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed a malicious
  certificate or for an application to continue certificate verification despite failure
  to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email
  address in a certificate to overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the
  `.' character (decimal 46) on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a
  crash (causing a denial of service). In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting
  to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests
  client authentication and a malicious client connects. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.7 (Affected
  3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2,3.0.3,3.0.4,3.0.5,3.0.6)."
