package_slug: "conan/openssl"
title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "Issue summary: The AES-SIV cipher implementation contains a bug that
  causes\nit to ignore empty associated data entries which are unauthenticated as\na
  consequence.\n\nImpact summary: Applications that use the AES-SIV algorithm and
  want to\nauthenticate empty data entries as associated data can be mislead by removing\nadding
  or reordering such empty entries as these are ignored by the OpenSSL\nimplementation.
  We are currently unaware of any such applications.\n\nThe AES-SIV algorithm allows
  for authentication of multiple associated\ndata entries along with the encryption.
  To authenticate empty data the\napplication has to call EVP_EncryptUpdate() (or
  EVP_CipherUpdate()) with\nNULL pointer as the output buffer and 0 as the input buffer
  length.\nThe AES-SIV implementation in OpenSSL just returns success for such a call\ninstead
  of performing the associated data authentication operation.\nThe empty data thus
  will not be authenticated.\n\nAs this issue does not affect non-empty associated
  data authentication and\nwe expect it to be rare for an application to use empty
  associated data\nentries this is qualified as Low severity issue."
