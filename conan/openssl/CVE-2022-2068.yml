package_slug: "conan/openssl"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command
  Injection')"
description: "In addition to the c_rehash shell command injection identified in CVE-2022-1292,
  further circumstances where the c_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell
  metacharacters to prevent command injection were found by code review. When the
  CVE-2022-1292 was fixed it was not discovered that there are other places in the
  script where the file names of certificates being hashed were possibly passed to
  a command executed through the shell. This script is distributed by some operating
  systems in a manner where it is automatically executed. On such operating systems,
  an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script.
  Use of the c_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be replaced by the
  OpenSSL rehash command line tool. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.4 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2,3.0.3).
  Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1p (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1o). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zf (Affected
  1.0.2-1.0.2ze)."
