- "CVE-2022-3996"
package_slug: "conan/openssl"
title: "Improper Locking"
description: "If an X.509 certificate contains a malformed policy constraint and policy
  processing is enabled, then a write lock will be taken twice recursively. On some
  operating systems (most widely: Windows) this results in a denial of service when
  the affected process hangs. Policy processing being enabled on a publicly facing
  server is not considered to be a common setup. Policy processing is enabled by passing
  the `-policy' argument to the command line utilities or by calling either `X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy()'
  or `X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' functions."
