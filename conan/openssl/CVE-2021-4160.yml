title: "Carry Propagation bug"
description: "There is a carry propagation bug in the MIPS32 and MIPS64 squaring procedure. 
  Many EC algorithms are affected, including some of the TLS 1.3 default curves. Impact was 
  not analyzed in detail, because the pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely and 
  include reusing private keys. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result 
  of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks 
  against DH are considered just feasible (although very difficult) because most of the 
  work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The 
  amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant. However, for an 
  attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share the DH private key among 
  multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701."
