package_slug: "conan/openssl"
title: "NULL Pointer Dereference"
description: "A NULL pointer can be dereferenced when signatures are being verified
  on PKCS7 signed or signedAndEnveloped data. In case the hash algorithm used for
  the signature is known to the OpenSSL library but the implementation of the hash
  algorithm is not available the digest initialization will fail. There is a missing
  check for the return value from the initialization function which later leads to
  invalid usage of the digest API most likely leading to a crash. The unavailability
  of an algorithm can be caused by using FIPS enabled configuration of providers or
  more commonly by not loading the legacy provider. PKCS7 data is processed by the
  SMIME library calls and also by the time stamp (TS) library calls. The TLS implementation
  in OpenSSL does not call these functions however third party applications would
  be affected if they call these functions to verify signatures on untrusted data."
