package_slug: "conan/openssl"
title: "Timing based side channel"
description: "A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementation
  which could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in a Bleichenbacher
  style attack. To achieve a successful decryption an attacker would have to be able
  to send a very large number of trial messages for decryption. The vulnerability
  affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5, RSA-OEAP and RSASVE. For example, in
  a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send an encrypted pre-master
  secret to the server. An attacker that had observed a genuine connection between
  a client and a server could use this flaw to send trial messages to the server and
  record the time taken to process them. After a sufficiently large number of messages
  the attacker could recover the pre-master secret used for the original connection
  and thus be able to decrypt the application data sent over that connection."
