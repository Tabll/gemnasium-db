package_slug: "conan/openssl"
title: "Double Free"
description: "The function PEM_read_bio_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses
  and decodes the \"name\" (e.g. \"CERTIFICATE\"), any header data and the payload
  data. If the function succeeds then the \"name_out\", \"header\" and \"data\" arguments
  are populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data. The
  caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a PEM
  file that results in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case PEM_read_bio_ex() will
  return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer to a
  buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this buffer then a
  double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. This could be exploited
  by an attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM files for parsing to
  achieve a denial of service attack. The functions PEM_read_bio() and PEM_read()
  are simple wrappers around PEM_read_bio_ex() and therefore these functions are also
  directly affected. These functions are also called indirectly by a number of other
  OpenSSL functions including PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio_ex() and SSL_CTX_use_serverinfo_file()
  which are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL internal uses of these functions are not
  vulnerable because the caller does not free the header argument if PEM_read_bio_ex()
  returns a failure code. These locations include the PEM_read_bio_TYPE() functions
  as well as the decoders introduced in OpenSSL 3.0. The OpenSSL asn1parse command
  line application is also impacted by this issue."
