identifiers:
- "CVE-2023-0217"
package_slug: "conan/openssl"
title: "NULL Pointer Dereference"
description: "An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an application
  tries to check a malformed DSA public key by the EVP_PKEY_public_check() function.
  This will most likely lead to an application crash. This function can be called
  on public keys supplied from untrusted sources which could allow an attacker to
  cause a denial of service attack. The TLS implementation in OpenSSL does not call
  this function but applications might call the function if there are additional security
  requirements imposed by standards such as FIPS 140-3."
