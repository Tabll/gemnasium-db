package_slug: "conan/openssl"
title: "Out-of-bounds Read"
description: "Issue summary: The AES-XTS cipher decryption implementation for 64 bit
  ARM\nplatform contains a bug that could cause it to read past the input buffer,\nleading
  to a crash.\n\nImpact summary: Applications that use the AES-XTS algorithm on the
  64 bit ARM\nplatform can crash in rare circumstances. The AES-XTS algorithm is usually\nused
  for disk encryption.\n\nThe AES-XTS cipher decryption implementation for 64 bit
  ARM platform will read\npast the end of the ciphertext buffer if the ciphertext
  size is 4 mod 5 in 16\nbyte blocks, e.g. 144 bytes or 1024 bytes. If the memory
  after the ciphertext\nbuffer is unmapped, this will trigger a crash which results
  in a denial of\nservice.\n\nIf an attacker can control the size and location of
  the ciphertext buffer\nbeing decrypted by an application using AES-XTS on 64 bit
  ARM, the\napplication is affected. This is fairly unlikely making this issue\na
  Low severity one."
