package_slug: "conan/openssl"
title: "Improper Certificate Validation"
description: "A security vulnerability has been identified in all supported versions
  of OpenSSL related to the verification of X.509 certificate chains that include
  policy constraints. Attackers may be able to exploit this vulnerability by creating
  a malicious certificate chain that triggers exponential use of computational resources,
  leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on affected systems. Policy processing
  is disabled by default but can be enabled by passing the `-policy' argument to the
  command line utilities or by calling the `X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' function."
