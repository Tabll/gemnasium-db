title: "Use After Free"
description: "Wasmtime is a standalone runtime for WebAssembly. There is a bug in
  the Wasmtime's code generator, Cranelift, where functions using reference types
  may be incorrectly missing metadata required for runtime garbage collection. This
  means that if a GC happens at runtime then the GC pass will mistakenly think these
  functions do not have live references to GC'd values, reclaiming them and deallocating
  them. The function will then subsequently continue to use the values assuming they
  had not been GC'd, leading later to a use-after-free. This bug was introduced in
  the migration to the `regalloc2` register allocator that occurred in the Wasmtime
  0.37.0 release on 2022-05-20. This bug has been patched and users should upgrade
  to Wasmtime version 0.38.2. Mitigations for this issue can be achieved by disabling
  the reference types proposal by passing `false` to `wasmtime::Config::wasm_reference_types`
  or downgrading to Wasmtime 0.36.0 or prior."
