package_slug: "conan/xerces-c"
title: "Use After Free"
description: >
  The Apache Xerces C++ XML parser on versions 3.0.0 before 3.2.5 contains a 
  use-after-free error triggered during the scanning of external DTDs. Users are 
  recommended to upgrade to version 3.2.5 which fixes the issue, or mitigate the 
  issue by disabling DTD processing. This can be accomplished via the DOM using a 
  standard parser feature, or via SAX using the XERCES_DISABLE_DTD environment 
  variable. This issue has been disclosed before as CVE-2018-1311, but unfortunately 
  that advisory incorrectly stated the issue would be fixed in version 3.2.3 or 3.2.4.
