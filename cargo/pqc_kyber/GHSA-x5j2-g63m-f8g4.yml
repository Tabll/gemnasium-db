title: "pqc_kyber KyberSlash: division timings depending on secrets"
description: "Various Kyber software libraries in various environments leak secret
  information into timing, specifically because\n\n* these libraries include a line
  of code that divides a secret numerator by a public denominator,\n* the number of
  CPU cycles for division in various environments varies depending on the inputs to
  the division, and\n* this variation appears within the range of numerators used
  in these libraries.\n\nThe KyberSlash pages track which Kyber [libraries](https://kyberslash.cr.yp.to/libraries.html)
  have this issue, and include a [FAQ](https://kyberslash.cr.yp.to/faq.html) about
  the issue."
