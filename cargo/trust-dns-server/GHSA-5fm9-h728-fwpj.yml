title: "trust-dns vulnerable to Remote Attackers causing Denial-of-Service (packet
  loops) with crafted DNS packets"
description: "trust-dns and trust-dns-server are vulnerable to remotely triggered
  denial-of-service attacks, consuming both network and CPU resources.\nDNS messages
  with the QR=1 bit set are responded to with a `FormErr` response.\nThis allows creating
  a traffic loop, in which these `FormErr` responses are sent nonstop between vulnerable
  servers.\n\nThere are two scenarios how this can be exploited: 1) Create a loop
  between two instances of trust-dns, consuming network resources, or 2) consuming
  the CPU of a single instance.\n\nWith two instances *A* and *B* an attacker sends
  a DNS query with a spoofed source IP address to *A*.\n*A* replies with a `FormErr`
  to *B*.\nNow both servers with ping-pong the message back and forth until by chance
  the packet is dropped in the network.\nMultiple spoofed packets can be sent by the
  attacker, increasing resource consumption.\n\nA single server can get locked up
  replying to itself.\nSame setup as above, but now *A* sends the reply to itself.\nThe
  packet is sent out as fast as the CPU and network stack manage.\nThis locks up a
  CPU core.\nMultiple packets from the attacker consume multiple CPU cores."
