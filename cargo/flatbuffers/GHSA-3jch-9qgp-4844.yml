title: "Generated code can read and write out of bounds in safe code"
description: "Code generated by flatbuffers' compiler is `unsafe` but not marked as
  such.\nSee https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/issues/6627 for details.\n\nAll
  users that use generated code by `flatbuffers` compiler are recommended to:\n1.
  not expose flatbuffer generated code as part of their public APIs\n2. audit their
  code and look for any usage of `follow`, `push`, or any method that uses them\n(e.g.
  `self_follow`).\n3. Carefuly go through the crates' documentation to understand
  which \"safe\" APIs are not\nintended to be used."
