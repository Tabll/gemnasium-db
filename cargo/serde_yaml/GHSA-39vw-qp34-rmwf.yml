title: "Uncontrolled recursion leads to abort in deserialization"
description: "Affected versions of this crate did not properly check for recursion
  while deserializing aliases. This allows an attacker to make a YAML file with an
  alias referring to itself causing an abort. The flaw was corrected by checking the
  recursion depth."
