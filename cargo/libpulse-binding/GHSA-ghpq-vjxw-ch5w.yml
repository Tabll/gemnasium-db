title: "Use after free in libpulse-binding"
description: "### Overview\n\nVersion 1.2.1 of the `libpulse-binding` Rust crate,
  released on the 15th of June 2018, fixed a pair of use-after-free issues with the
  objects returned by the `get_format_info` and `get_context` methods of `Stream`
  objects. These objects were mistakenly being constructed without setting an important
  flag to prevent destruction of the underlying C objects they reference upon their
  own destruction.\n\nThis advisory is being written retrospectively, having previously
  only been noted in the changelog. No CVE assignment was sought.\n\n### Patches\n\nUsers
  are required to update to version 1.2.1 or newer.\n\nVersions older than 1.2.1 have
  been yanked from crates.io. This was believed to have already been done at the time
  of the 1.2.1 release, but upon double checking now they were found to still be available,
  so has been done now (22nd October 2020)."
