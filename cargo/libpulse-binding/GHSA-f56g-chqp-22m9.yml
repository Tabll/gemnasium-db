title: "Use after free in libpulse-binding"
description: "### Overview\n\nVersion 2.5.0 of the `libpulse-binding` Rust crate,
  released on the 22nd of December 2018, fixed a potential use-after-free issue with
  property list iteration due to a lack of a lifetime constraint tying the lifetime
  of a `proplist::Iterator` to the `Proplist` object for which it was created. This
  made it possible for users, without experiencing a compiler error/warning, to destroy
  the `Proplist` object before the iterator, thus destroying the underlying C object
  the iterator works upon, before the iterator may be finished with it.\n\nThis advisory
  is being written retrospectively, having previously only been noted in the changelog.
  No CVE assignment was sought.\n\nThis impacts all versions of the crate before 2.5.0
  back to 1.0.5. Before version 1.0.5 the function that produces the iterator was
  broken to the point of being useless.\n\n### Patches\n\nUsers are required to update
  to version 2.5.0 or newer.\n\nVersions older than 2.5.0 have been yanked from crates.io
  as of the 22nd of October 2020."
