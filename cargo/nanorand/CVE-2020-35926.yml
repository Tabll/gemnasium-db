package_slug: "cargo/nanorand"
title: "Improper random number generation in nanorand"
description: "In versions of nanorand prior to 0.5.1, RandomGen implementations for
  standard unsigned integers could fail to properly generate numbers, due to using
  bit-shifting to truncate a 64-bit number, rather than just an as conversion. This
  often manifested as RNGs returning nothing but 0, including the cryptographically
  secure ChaCha random number generator."
