title: "Threshold value is ignored (all shares are n=3)"
description: "Affected versions of this crate did not properly calculate secret shares
  requirements.\n\nThis reduces the security of the algorithm by restricting the crate
  to always\nusing a threshold value of three, rather than a configurable limit.\n\nThe
  flaw was corrected by correctly configuring the threshold."
