package_slug: "cargo/appendix"
title: "Data races in appendix"
description: "The `appendix` crate implements a key-value mapping data structure called\n`Index<K,
  V>` that is stored on disk. The crate allows for any type to inhabit\nthe generic
  `K` and `V` type parameters and implements Send and Sync for them\nunconditionally.\n\nUsing
  a type that is not marked as `Send` or `Sync` with `Index` can allow it\nto be used
  across multiple threads leading to data races. Additionally using\nreference types
  for the keys or values will lead to the segmentation faults\nin the crate's code."
