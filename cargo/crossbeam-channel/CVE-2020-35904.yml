package_slug: "cargo/crossbeam-channel"
title: "Incorrect buffer size in crossbeam-channel"
description: "The affected version of this crate's the bounded channel incorrectly
  assumes that Vec::from_iter has allocated capacity that same as the number of iterator
  elements. Vec::from_iter does not actually guarantee that and may allocate extra
  memory. The destructor of the bounded channel reconstructs Vec from the raw pointer
  based on the incorrect assumes described above. This is unsound and causing deallocation
  with the incorrect capacity when Vec::from_iter has allocated different sizes with
  the number of iterator elements."
