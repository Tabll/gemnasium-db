package_slug: "cargo/crossbeam-channel"
title: "crossbeam-channel Undefined Behavior before v0.4.4"
description: "The affected version of this crate's the `bounded` channel incorrectly
  assumes that `Vec::from_iter` has allocated capacity that same as the number of
  iterator elements. `Vec::from_iter` does not actually guarantee that and may allocate
  extra memory. The destructor of the `bounded` channel reconstructs `Vec` from the
  raw pointer based on the incorrect assumes described above. This is unsound and
  causing deallocation with the incorrect capacity when `Vec::from_iter` has allocated
  different sizes with the number of iterator elements."
