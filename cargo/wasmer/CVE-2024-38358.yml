title: "Symlink bypasses filesystem sandbox"
description: "If the preopened directory has a symlink pointing outside, WASI programs
  can traverse the symlink and access host filesystem if the caller sets both `oflags::creat`
  and `rights::fd_write`. Programs can also crash the runtime by creating a symlink
  pointing outside with `path_symlink` and `path_open`ing the link."
