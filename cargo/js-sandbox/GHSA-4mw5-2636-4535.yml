title: "op_panic in the base runtime can force a panic in the runtime's containing
  thread"
description: "Affected versions use deno_core releases that expose `Deno.core.ops.op_panic`
  to the JS runtime in the base core\n\nThis function when called triggers a manual
  panic in the thread containing the runtime, breaking sandboxing\n\nIt can be fixed
  by stubbing out the exposed op:\n```javascript\nDeno.core.ops.op_panic = (msg) =>
  { throw new Error(msg) };\n```"
