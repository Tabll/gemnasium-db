title: "Segmentation fault in time"
description: "Unix-like operating systems may segfault due to dereferencing a dangling
  pointer in specific circumstances. This requires an environment variable to be set
  in a different thread than the affected functions. This may occur without the user's
  knowledge, notably in a third-party library.\n\nThe affected functions from time
  0.2.7 through 0.2.22 are:\n\n- `time::UtcOffset::local_offset_at`\n- `time::UtcOffset::try_local_offset_at`\n-
  `time::UtcOffset::current_local_offset`\n- `time::UtcOffset::try_current_local_offset`\n-
  `time::OffsetDateTime::now_local`\n- `time::OffsetDateTime::try_now_local`\n\nThe
  affected functions in time 0.1 (all versions) are:\n\n- `at`\n- `at_utc`\n- `now`\n\nNon-Unix
  targets (including Windows and wasm) are unaffected."
