title: "time vulnerable to stack exhaustion Denial of Service attack"
description: "When user-provided input is provided to any type that parses with the
  RFC 2822 format, a Denial of Service attack via stack exhaustion is possible. The
  attack relies on formally deprecated and rarely-used features that are part of the
  RFC 2822 format used in a malicious manner. Ordinary, non-malicious input will never
  encounter this scenario."
