title: "rPGP vulnerable to parser crash on crafted RSA secret key packets through
  CVE-2026-21895"
description: "It was possible to trigger an unhandled edge case in the Rust Crypto
  rsa crate through rPGP packet parsing functionality, and crash the process that
  runs rPGP. This problem has been patched in a new rsa version. The new release of
  rPGP ensures a patched version of the rsa crate is in use, which prevents this issue."
