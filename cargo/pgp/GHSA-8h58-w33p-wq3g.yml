title: "rPGP affected by crash in message handling for deeply nested messages"
description: "Previous rPGP versions could be caused to crash with a \"stack overflow\"
  when parsing messages that contain deeply nested message layers, such as messages
  with many signatures.\n\nrPGP 0.19.0 resolves this issue with a more robust message
  handling implementation (via https://github.com/rpgp/rpgp/pull/625)."
