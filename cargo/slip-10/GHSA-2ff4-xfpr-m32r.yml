title: "`Slip10Like` derivation method instantiated with certain curves may allow
  attacker to find derivation path which results into very long derivation (possible
  DoS)"
description: "<!-- _What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_ -->\n\n**Impacted
  are the only ones who use [`hd_wallet::Slip10Like`](https://docs.rs/hd-wallet/0.5.1/hd_wallet/struct.Slip10Like.html)
  or [`slip_10`](https://docs.rs/slip-10/latest/slip_10/) derivation method instantiated
  with curves other than secp256k1 and secp256r1.**\n\n`hd_wallet` crate used to provide
  `Slip10Like` derivation method, which is also provided in `slip-10` crate as a default
  derivation method. It's based on [slip10](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0010.md)
  method that searches for a valid child key in an infinite loop until it's found.\n\nTheoretically,
  this could be exploited by an attacker by finding a derivation path that would force
  someone to execute a lot of iterations of this loop to find a valid child key. This
  attack, however, requires the probability of getting an invalid scalar from random
  32 bytes to be high. Slip10 is protected from this attack as it's only defined on
  secp256k1 and secp256r1 curves, for which such probability is very low:\n\n- For
  secp256k1, probability is $< 2^{-127}$. This means that a loop with 2 or more iterations
  is vanishingly impossible.\n- For secp256r1, probability is $< 2^{-32}$. This means
  that a loop with 5 or more iterations is vanishingly impossible.\n\nWhile standard
  curves are safe to use with slip10, we used to allow slip10-like derivation which
  can be instantiated with any curve. For instance, one could instantiate it with
  ed25519 or stark curves, for which probability of getting invalid scalar from random
  32 bytes is >90%, so theoretically, attacker could try to DoS such construction."
