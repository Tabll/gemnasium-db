package_slug: "cargo/simd-json"
title: "Out of bounds read in simd-json"
description: "The affected version of this crate did not guard against accessing memory
  beyond the range of its input data. A pointer cast to read the data into a 256-bit
  register could lead to a segmentation fault when the end plus the 32 bytes (256
  bit) read would overlap into the next page during string parsing. This allows an
  attacker to eventually crash a service. The flaw was corrected by using a padding
  buffer for the last read from the input. So that we are we never read over the boundary
  of the input data."
