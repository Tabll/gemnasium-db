package_slug: "cargo/try-mutex"
title: "Data races in try-mutex"
description: "Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implemented Sync trait
  for TryMutex<T> type. This allows users to put non-Send T type in TryMutex and send
  it to another thread, which can cause a data race. The flaw was corrected in the
  0.3.0 release by adding T: Send bound for the Sync trait implementation."
