title: "Namada-apps allows Post-Genesis Validator Bypass"
description: "Ledger crash. A user is able to initialize a post-genesis validator
  with a negative commission rate using the `--force` flag. If this validator gets
  into the consensus set, then when computing PoS inflation inside `fn update_rewards_products_and_mint_inflation`,
  an instance of `mul_floor` will cause the return of an `Err`, which causes `finalize_block`
  to error."
