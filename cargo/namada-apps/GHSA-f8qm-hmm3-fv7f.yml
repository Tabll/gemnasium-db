title: "Namada-apps allows Excessive Computation in Mempool Validation"
description: "A malicious transaction may cause an expensive computation in mempool
  validation.\n\nA transaction with multiple repeated sections causes the section
  hash calculation used for signature validation to grow exponentially (and potentially
  even cubic) in proportion to number of sections. This may be used to significantly
  slow down operation of nodes."
