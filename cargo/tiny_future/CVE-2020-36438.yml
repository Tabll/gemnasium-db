package_slug: "cargo/tiny_future"
title: "Data race in tiny_future"
description: "tiny_future contains a light-weight implementation of Futures. The Future
  type it has lacked bound on its Send and Sync traits. This allows for a bug where
  non-thread safe types such as Cell can be used in Futures and cause data races in
  concurrent programs. The flaw was corrected in commit `c791919` by adding trait
  bounds to Future's Send and Sync."
