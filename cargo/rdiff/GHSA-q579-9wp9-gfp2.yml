title: "Window can read out of bounds if Read instance returns more bytes than buffer
  size"
description: "`rdiff` performs a diff of two provided strings or files. As part of
  its reading code it uses the return value of a `Read` instance to set the length
  of its internal character vector.\n\nIf the `Read` implementation claims that it
  has read more bytes than the length of the provided buffer, the length of the vector
  will be set to longer than its capacity. This causes `rdiff` APIs to return uninitialized
  memory in its API\nmethods."
