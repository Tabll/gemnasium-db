title: "xous has unsound usages of `core::slice::from_raw_parts` "
description: "We consider `as_slice` and `as_slice_mut` unsound because: the pointer
  with any bit patterns could be cast to the slice of arbitrary types. The pointer
  could be created by unsafe new and deprecated `from_parts`. We consider that `from_parts`
  should be removed in latest version because it will help trigger unsoundness in
  `as_slice`. With new declared as unsafe, `as_slice` should also declared as unsafe.\n\nThis
  was patched in by marking two functions as `unsafe`."
