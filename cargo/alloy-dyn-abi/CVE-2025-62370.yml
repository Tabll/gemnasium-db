title: "alloy-dyn-abi has DoS vulnerability on `alloy_dyn_abi::TypedData` hashing"
description: "An uncaught panic triggered by malformed input to `alloy_dyn_abi::TypedData`
  could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) via `eip712_signing_hash()`.\n\nSoftware
  with high availability requirements such as network services may be particularly
  impacted. If in use, external auto-restarting mechanisms can partially mitigate
  the availability issues unless repeated attacks are possible."
