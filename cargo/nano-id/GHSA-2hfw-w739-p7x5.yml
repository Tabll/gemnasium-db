title: "Duplicate Advisory: nano-id reduced entropy due to inadequate character set
  usage"
description: "Affected versions of the nano-id crate incorrectly generated IDs using
  a reduced character set in the `nano_id::base62` and `nano_id::base58` functions.
  Specifically, the `base62` function used a character set of 32 symbols instead of
  the intended 62 symbols, and the `base58` function used a character set of 16 symbols
  instead of the intended 58 symbols. Additionally, the `nano_id::gen` macro is also
  affected when a custom character set that is not a power of 2 in size is specified.\n\nIt
  should be noted that `nano_id::base64` is not affected by this vulnerability."
