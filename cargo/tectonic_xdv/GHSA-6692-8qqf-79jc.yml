title: "`Read` on uninitialized buffer may cause UB ('tectonic_xdv' crate)"
description: "Affected versions of this crate passes an uninitialized buffer to a
  user-provided `Read` implementation.\n\nArbitrary `Read` implementations can read
  from the uninitialized buffer (memory exposure) and also can return incorrect number
  of bytes written to the buffer. Reading from uninitialized memory produces undefined
  values that can quickly invoke undefined behavior.\n\nThe problem was fixed in commit
  `cdff034` by zero-initializing the buffer before passing it to a user-provided `Read`
  implementation."
