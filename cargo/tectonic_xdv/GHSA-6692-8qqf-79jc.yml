title: "Duplicate Advisory: `Read` on uninitialized buffer may cause UB ('tectonic_xdv'
  crate)"
description: "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-qwvx-c8j7-5g75. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n## Original Description\nAffected versions of this crate passes an
  uninitialized buffer to a user-provided `Read` implementation.\n\nArbitrary `Read`
  implementations can read from the uninitialized buffer (memory exposure) and also
  can return incorrect number of bytes written to the buffer. Reading from uninitialized
  memory produces undefined values that can quickly invoke undefined behavior.\n\nThe
  problem was fixed in commit `cdff034` by zero-initializing the buffer before passing
  it to a user-provided `Read` implementation."
