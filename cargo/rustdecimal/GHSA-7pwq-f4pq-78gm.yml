title: "`rustdecimal` is a malicious crate"
description: "The Rust Security Response WG and the crates.io team [were notified][1]
  on 2022-05-02 of the existence of the malicious crate `rustdecimal`, which contained
  malware. The crate name was intentionally similar to the name of the popular [`rust_decimal`][2]
  crate, hoping that potential victims would misspell its name (an attack called \"typosquatting\").\n\nTo
  protect the security of the ecosystem, the crates.io team permanently removed the
  crate from the registry as soon as it was made aware of the malware. An analysis
  of all the crates on crates.io was also performed, and no other crate with similar
  code patterns was found.\n\nKeep in mind that the [`rust_decimal`][2] crate was
  **not** compromised, and it is still safe to use."
