title: "Multiple soundness issues in lexical"
description: "`lexical` contains multiple soundness issues:\n\n1. [Bytes::read() allows
  creating instances of types with invalid bit patterns](https://github.com/Alexhuszagh/rust-lexical/issues/102)\n1.
  [BytesIter::read() advances iterators out of bounds](https://github.com/Alexhuszagh/rust-lexical/issues/101)\n1.
  [The `BytesIter` trait has safety invariants but is public and not marked `unsafe`](https://github.com/Alexhuszagh/rust-lexical/issues/104)\n1.
  [`write_float()` calls `MaybeUninit::assume_init()` on uninitialized data, which
  is is not allowed by the Rust abstract machine](https://github.com/Alexhuszagh/rust-lexical/issues/95)\n\nThe
  crate also has some correctness issues and appears to be unmaintained."
