title: "PyO3 has a risk of use-after-free in `borrowed` reads from Python weak references"
description: "The family of functions to read \"borrowed\" values from Python weak
  references were fundamentally unsound, because the weak reference does itself not
  have ownership of the value. At any point the last strong reference could be cleared
  and the borrowed value would become dangling.\n\nIn PyO3 0.22.4 these functions
  have all been deprecated and patched to leak a strong reference as a mitigation.
  PyO3 0.23 will remove these functions entirely."
