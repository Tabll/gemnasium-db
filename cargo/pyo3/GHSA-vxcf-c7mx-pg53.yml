title: "Build corruption when using `PYO3_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable"
description: "In PyO3 0.23.0 the `PYO3_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable used to configure
  builds regressed such that changing the environment variable would no longer trigger
  PyO3 to reconfigure and recompile. In combination with workflows using tools such
  as `maturin` to build for multiple versions in a single build, this leads to Python
  wheels being compiled against the wrong Python API version.\n\nAll users who distribute
  artefacts for multiple Python versions are encouraged to update and rebuild with
  PyO3 0.23.3. Affected wheels produced from PyO3 0.23.0 through 0.23.2 are highly
  unstable and will crash the Python interpreter in unpredictable ways."
