title: "PyO3 Risk of buffer overflow in `PyString::from_object`"
description: "`PyString::from_object` took `&str` arguments and forwarded them directly
  to the Python C API without checking for terminating nul bytes. This could lead
  the Python interpreter to read beyond the end of the `&str` data and potentially
  leak contents of the out-of-bounds read (by raising a Python exception containing
  a copy of the data including the overflow).\n\nIn PyO3 0.24.1 this function will
  now allocate a `CString` to guarantee a terminating nul bytes. PyO3 0.25 will likely
  offer an alternative API which takes `&CStr` arguments."
