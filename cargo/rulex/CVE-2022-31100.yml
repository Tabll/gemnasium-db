package_slug: "cargo/rulex"
title: "Reachable Assertion in rulex"
description: "When parsing untrusted rulex expressions, rulex may crash, possibly
  enabling a Denial of Service attack. This happens when the expression contains a
  multi-byte UTF-8 code point in a string literal or after a backslash, because rulex
  tries to slice into the code point and panics as a result.\n\nThis is a security
  concern for you, if\n- your service parses untrusted rulex expressions (expressions
  provided by an untrusted user), and\n- your service becomes unavailable when the
  thread running rulex panics."
