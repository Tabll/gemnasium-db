package_slug: "cargo/rulex"
title: "Uncontrolled Recursion in rulex"
description: "When parsing untrusted rulex expressions, the stack may overflow, possibly
  enabling a Denial of Service attack. This happens when parsing an expression with
  several hundred levels of nesting, causing the process to abort immediately.\n\nThis
  is a security concern for you, if\n- your service parses untrusted rulex expressions
  (expressions provided by an untrusted user), and\n- your service becomes unavailable
  when the process running rulex aborts due to a stack overflow."
