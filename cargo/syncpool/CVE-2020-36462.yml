- "GHSA-vp6r-mrq9-8f4h"
package_slug: "cargo/syncpool"
title: "Data race in syncpool"
description: "Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implements Send for
  Bucket2. This allows sending non-Send types to other threads. This can lead to data
  races when non Send types like Cell<T> or Rc<T> are contained inside Bucket2 and
  sent across thread boundaries. The data races can potentially lead to memory corruption
  (as demonstrated in the PoC from the original report issue). The flaw was corrected
  in commit `15b2828` by adding a T: Send bound to the Send impl of Bucket2<T>."
