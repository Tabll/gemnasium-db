title: "Data races on syncpool"
description: "Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implements `Send` for
  `Bucket2`. This allows sending non-Send types to other threads.\n\nThis can lead
  to data races when non Send types like `Cell<T>` or `Rc<T>` are contained inside
  `Bucket2` and sent across thread boundaries. The data races can potentially lead
  to memory corruption (as demonstrated in the PoC from the original report issue).\n\nThe
  flaw was corrected in commit `15b2828` by adding a `T: Send` bound to the `Send`
  impl of `Bucket2<T>`."
