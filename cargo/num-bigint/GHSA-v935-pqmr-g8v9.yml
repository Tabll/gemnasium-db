title: "Unexpected panics in num-bigint"
description: "Two scenarios were reported where `BigInt` and `BigUint` multiplication
  may unexpectedly panic.\n\n- The internal `mac3` function did not expect the possibility
  of non-empty all-zero inputs, leading to an `unwrap()` panic.\n- A buffer was allocated
  with less capacity than needed for an intermediate result, leading to an assertion
  panic.\n\nRust panics can either cause stack unwinding or program abort, depending
  on the application configuration. In some settings, an unexpected panic may constitute
  a denial-of-service vulnerability."
