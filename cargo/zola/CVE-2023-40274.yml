title: "zola Path Traversal vulnerability"
description: "An issue was discovered in zola 0.13.0 through 0.17.2. The custom implementation
  of a web server, available via the \"zola serve\" command, allows directory traversal.
  The `handle_request` function, used by the server to process HTTP requests, does
  not account for sequences of special path control characters (`../`) in the URL
  when serving a file, which allows one to escape the webroot of the server and read
  arbitrary files from the filesystem."
