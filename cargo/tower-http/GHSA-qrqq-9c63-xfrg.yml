title: "tower-http's improper validation of Windows paths could lead to directory
  traversal attack"
description: "`tower_http::services::fs::ServeDir` didn't correctly validate Windows
  paths, meaning paths like `/foo/bar/c:/windows/web/screen/img101.png` would be allowed
  and respond with the contents of `c:/windows/web/screen/img101.png`. Thus users
  could potentially read files anywhere on the filesystem.\n\nThis only impacts Windows.
  Linux and other unix likes are not impacted by this.\n\nSee [tower-http#204] for
  more details.\n\n[tower-http#204]: https://github.com/tower-rs/tower-http/pull/204"
