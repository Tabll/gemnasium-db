package_slug: "cargo/actix-http"
title: "HTTP Request Smuggling in actix-http"
description: "Affected versions of this crate did not properly detect invalid requests
  that could allow HTTP/1 request smuggling (HRS) attacks when running alongside a
  vulnerable front-end proxy server. This can result in leaked internal and/or user
  data, including credentials, when the front-end proxy is also vulnerable.\n\nPopular
  front-end proxies and load balancers already mitigate HRS attacks so it is recommended
  that they are also kept up to date; check your specific set up. You should upgrade
  even if the front-end proxy receives exclusively HTTP/2 traffic and connects to
  the back-end using HTTP/1; several downgrade attacks are known that can also expose
  HRS vulnerabilities."
