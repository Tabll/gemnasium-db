title: "Non-atomic writes in cgc"
description: "# Multiple soundness issues in `Ptr` in cgc\n\nAffected versions of
  this crate have the following issues:\n\n1. `Ptr` implements `Send` and `Sync` for
  all types, this can lead to data\n   races by sending non-thread safe types across
  threads.\n\n2. `Ptr::get` violates mutable alias rules by returning multiple mutable\n
  \  references to the same object.\n\n3. `Ptr::write` uses non-atomic writes to the
  underlying pointer. This means\n   that when used across threads it can lead to
  data races."
