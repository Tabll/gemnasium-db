package_slug: "cargo/cgc"
title: "Multiple soundness issues in cgc"
description: "Affected versions of this crate have the following issues:\n\n1. `Ptr`
  implements `Send` and `Sync` for all types, this can lead to data\nraces by sending
  non-thread safe types across threads.\n\n2. `Ptr::get` violates mutable alias rules
  by returning multiple mutable\nreferences to the same object.\n\n3. `Ptr::write`
  uses non-atomic writes to the underlying pointer. This means\nthat when used across
  threads it can lead to data races."
