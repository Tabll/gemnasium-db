title: "SurrealDB bypass of deny-net flags via redirect results in server-side request
  forgery (SSRF)"
description: "SurrealDB offers http functions that can access external network endpoints.
  A typical, albeit [not recommended ](https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/reference-guide/security-best-practices#example-deny-all-capabilities-with-some-exceptions)
  configuration would be to start SurrealDB with all network connections allowed with
  the exception of a deny list. For example, `surreal start --allow-net --deny-net
  10.0.0.0/8` will allow all network connections except to the 10.0.0.0/8 block.\n\nAn
  authenticated user of SurrealDB can use redirects to bypass this restriction. For
  example by hosting a server on the public internet which redirects to the IP addresses
  blocked by the administrator of the SurrealDB server via HTTP 301 or 307 response
  codes.\n\nWhen sending SurrealDB statements containing the `http::*` functions to
  the attacker controlled host, the SurrealDB server will follow the redirects to
  the blocked IP address. Because the statements also return the responses to the
  attacker, this issue constitutes a full SSRF vulnerability.\n\nThis issue was discovered
  and patched during an code audit and penetration test of SurrealDB by cure53, the
  severity as defined within cure53's preliminary finding is Medium, matched by our
  CVSS v4 assessment."
