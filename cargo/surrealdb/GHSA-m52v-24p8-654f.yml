title: "SurrealDB has an Uncaught Exception Sorting Tables by Random Order"
description: "Sorting table records using an `ORDER BY` clause with the `rand()` function
  as sorting mechanism could cause a panic due to relying on a comparison function
  that did not implement total order. This event resulted in a panic due to a recent
  [change in Rust 1.81](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/09/05/Rust-1.81.0.html#new-sort-implementations)."
