title: "SurrealDB memory exhaustion via string::replace using regex "
description: "An authenticated user can craft a query using the `string::replace`
  function that uses a Regex to perform a string replacement. As there is a failure
  to restrict the resulting string length, this enables an attacker to send a `string::replace`
  function to the SurrealDB server exhausting all the memory of the server due to
  string allocations. This eventually results in a Denial-of-Service situation for
  the SurrealDB server.\n\nThis issue was discovered and patched during an code audit
  and penetration test of SurrealDB by cure53. Using CVSSv4 definitions, the severity
  is High."
