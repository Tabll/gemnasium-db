title: "Externally Controlled Format String in Scripting Functions"
description: "The `rquickjs` crate used by SurrealDB implements Rust bindings to the
  QuickJS C library and is used to execute SurrealDB scripting functions. The `rquickjs`
  function `Exception::throw_type` takes a string and returns an error object. Prior
  to version `0.4.2` of the crate, this string would be fed directly into `printf`,
  which will receive the error string as a format string with no additional arguments,
  leading to undefined behavior. This issue triggers when a SurrealDB scripting function
  returns an error and its input contains a format string such as `%s` or `%d`.\n\nThis
  vulnerability can only affect SurrealDB servers explicitly enabling the scripting
  capability with `--allow-scripting` or `--allow-all` and equivalent environment
  variables `SURREAL_CAPS_ALLOW_SCRIPT=true` and `SURREAL_CAPS_ALLOW_ALL=true`."
