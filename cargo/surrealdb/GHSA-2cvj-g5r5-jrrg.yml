title: "SurrealDB has local file read of 2-column TSV files via analyzers "
description: "An authenticated system user at the root, namespace, or database levels
  can use the `DEFINE ANALYZER` statement to point to arbitrary file locations on
  the file system, and should the file be tab separated with two columns, the analyzer
  can be leveraged to exfiltrate the content.\n\nThis issue was discovered and patched
  during an code audit and penetration test of SurrealDB by cure53, the severity defined
  within cure53's preliminary finding is Low, matched by our CVSS v4 assessment."
