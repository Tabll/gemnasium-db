title: "SurrealDB vulnerable to Uncontrolled CPU Consumption via WebSocket Interface"
description: "SurrealDB depends on the `tungstenite` and `tokio-tungstenite` crates
  used by the `axum` crate, which handles connections to the SurrealDB WebSocket interface.
  On versions before `0.20.1`, the `tungstenite` crate presented an issue which allowed
  the parsing of HTTP headers during the client handshake to continuously consume
  high CPU when the headers were very long. All affected crates have been updated
  in SurrealDB version `1.1.0`.\n\nFrom the original advisory for [CVE-2023-43669](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-43669):\n\"The
  Tungstenite crate through 0.20.0 for Rust allows remote attackers to cause a denial
  of service (minutes of CPU consumption) via an excessive length of an HTTP header
  in a client handshake. The length affects both how many times a parse is attempted
  (e.g., thousands of times) and the average amount of data for each parse attempt
  (e.g., millions of bytes).\""
