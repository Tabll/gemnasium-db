title: "SurrealDB has an Uncaught Exception Handling Nonexistent Role"
description: "Roles for system users are stored as generic `Ident` values and converted
  as strings and into the `Role` enum whenever IAM operations are to be performed
  that require processing the user roles. This conversion expects those identifiers
  to only contain the values `owner`, `editor` and `viewer` and will return an error
  otherwise. However, the `unwrap()` method would be called on this result when implementing
  `std::convert::From<&Ident> for Role`, which would result in a panic where a nonexistent
  role was used."
