title: "Full Table Permissions by Default"
description: "Default table permissions in SurrealDB were `FULL` instead of `NONE`.
  This would lead to tables having `FULL` permissions for `SELECT`, `CREATE`, `UPDATE`
  and `DELETE` unless some other permissions were specified via the `PERMISSIONS`
  clause.\n\nWe have decided to treat this behaviour as a vulnerability due to its
  security implications, especially considering the lack of specific documentation
  and potential for confusion due to the `INFO FOR DB` statement previously not displaying
  default permissions. Treating it as a bug fix provides justification for a change
  in default behavior outside of a major release."
