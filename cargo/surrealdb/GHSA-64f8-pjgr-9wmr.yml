title: "Untrusted Query Object Evaluation in RPC API"
description: "During the sign in and sign up operations through the SurrealDB RPC
  API, an arbitrary object would be accepted in order to support a wide array of types
  and structures that could contain user credentials. This arbitrary object could
  potentially contain any SurrealDB value, including an object representing a subquery.
  For this to materialize, this object would need to be encoded using the bincode
  serialization format instead of the default JSON serialization format or the additionally
  supported CBOR serialization format.\n\nIf a binary object containing a subquery
  were to be provided in this way, that subquery would be computed while executing
  the `SIGNIN` and `SIGNUP` queries defined by the database owner while defining a
  record access method. Since those queries are executed under a system user session
  with the editor role, an unauthenticated attacker may be able to leverage this behavior
  to select, create, update and delete non-IAM resources with permissions of a system
  user with the editor role."
