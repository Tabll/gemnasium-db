title: "SurrealDB vulnerable to memory exhaustion via nested functions and scripts"
description: "In order to prevent DoS situations due to infinite recursions, SurrealDB
  implements a limit of nested calls for both native functions and embedded JavaScript
  functions.\n\nHowever, in SurrealDB instances with embedded scripting functions
  enabled, it was found that this limit can be circumvented by utilizing both at the
  same time. If a native function contains JavaScript which issues a new query that
  calls that function, the recursion limit is not triggered.\n\nOnce executed, SurrealDB
  will follow the path of infinite recursions until the system runs out of memory,
  prior to the recursion limit being triggered.\n\nThis vulnerability can only affect
  SurrealDB servers explicitly enabling the scripting capability with `--allow-scripting`
  or\n`--allow-all` and equivalent environment variables `SURREAL_CAPS_ALLOW_SCRIPT=true`
  and `SURREAL_CAPS_ALLOW_ALL=true`.\n\nThis issue was discovered and patched during
  an code audit and penetration test of SurrealDB by cure53, the severity defined
  within cure53's preliminary finding is Medium, matched by our CVSS v4 assessment."
