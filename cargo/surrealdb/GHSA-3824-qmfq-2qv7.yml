title: "SurrealDB no JavaScript script function default timeout could facilitate DoS"
description: "Through enabling the scripting capability. SurrealDB allows for advanced
  functions with complicated logic, by allowing embedded functions to be written in
  JavaScript.\n\nThese functions are bounded for memory and stack size, but not in
  time. An attacker could launch a number of long running functions that could potentially
  facilitate a Denial Of Service attack.\n\nThis vulnerability can only affect SurrealDB
  servers explicitly enabling the scripting capability with `--allow-scripting` or\n`--allow-all`
  and equivalent environment variables `SURREAL_CAPS_ALLOW_SCRIPT=true` and `SURREAL_CAPS_ALLOW_ALL=true`.\n\nThis
  issue was discovered and patched during an code audit and penetration test of SurrealDB
  by cure53, the severity defined within cure53's preliminary finding is Low, matched
  by our CVSS v4 assessment."
