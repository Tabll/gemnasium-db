title: "SurrealDB CPU exhaustion via custom functions result in total DoS"
description: "SurrealDB allows authenticated users with `OWNER` or `EDITOR` permissions
  at the root, database or namespace levels to define their own database functions
  using the `DEFINE FUNCTION` statement\n\nA custom database function comprises a
  name together with a function body. In the function body, the user programs the
  functionality of the function in terms of SurrealQL. The language includes a `FOR`
  keyword, used to implement for-loops.\n\nWhilst the parser and interpreter constrain
  the number of iterations for a single for-loop, nesting several for-loops with a
  large number of iterations is possible. Thus, an attacker could define a function
  that comprises several nested for-loops with an iteration count of 1.000.000 each.\n\nExecuting
  the function will consume all the CPU time of the server, timeouts configured will
  not break the CPU consumption, and the function execution monopolizes all CPU time
  of the SurrealDB server, effectively preventing the server from executing functions,
  queries, commands of other users, or allowing further connections being established
  to the server.\n\nTerminating the stuck server requires manual intervention which
  forces a quit on the server process, as the server application is not responsive
  any longer.\n\nThis issue was discovered and patched during an code audit and penetration
  test of SurrealDB by cure53, the severity defined within cure53's preliminary finding
  is high, matched by our CVSS v4 assessment."
