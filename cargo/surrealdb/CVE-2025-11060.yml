package_slug: "cargo/surrealdb"
title: "SurrealDB is Vulnerable to Unauthorized Data Exposure via LIVE Query Subscriptions"
description: "`LIVE SELECT` statements are used to capture changes to data within
  a table in real time. Documents included in `WHERE` conditions and `DELETE` notifications
  were not properly reduced to respect the querying user's security context. Instead
  the leaked documents reflect the context of the user triggering the notification.\n\nThis
  allows a record or guest user with permissions to run live query subscriptions on
  a table to observe unauthorised records within the same table, when another user
  is altering or deleting these records, bypassing access controls."
