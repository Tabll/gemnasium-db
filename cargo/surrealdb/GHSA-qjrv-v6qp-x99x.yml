title: "SurrealDB has an Uncaught Exception Handling Parsing Errors on Empty Strings"
description: "The error rendering code from the parser would panic when handling failed
  parsing of queries where the error occurred when converting an empty string to a
  SurrealDB value. This would be the case when casting an empty string to a `record`,
  `duration` or `datetime`, as well as potentially when parsing an empty string to
  JSON or providing an empty string to the `type::field` and `type::fields` functions."
