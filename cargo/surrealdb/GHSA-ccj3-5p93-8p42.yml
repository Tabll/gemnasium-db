title: "SurrealDB server-takeover via SurrealQL injection on backup import"
description: "The SurrealDB command-line tool allows exporting databases through the
  `export` command. It was discovered that table or field names are not properly sanitized
  in exports, leading to a SurrealQL injection when the backup is reimported.\n\nFor
  the injection to occur, an authenticated System User with `OWNER` or `EDITOR` roles
  needs to create tables or fields with malicious names containing SurrealQL, subsequently
  exported using the `export` operation\n\nThe attacker could achieve a privilege
  escalation and root level access to the SurrealDB instance if a higher privileged
  user subsequently performs the `import` operation.\n\nFurthermore, applications
  using SurrealDB that allow its users to define custom fields or tables are at risk
  of a universal second order SurrealQL injection, even if query parameters are properly
  sanitized.\n\nThis issue was discovered and patched during an code audit and penetration
  test of SurrealDB by cure53, the severity defined within cure53's preliminary finding
  is Critical, matched by our CVSS v4 assessment."
