title: "SurrealDB has an Uncaught Exception in Function Generating Random Time"
description: "The `rand::time()` function in SurrealQL generates a random time from
  an optional range of two Unix timestamps. Due to the underlying use of `timestamp_opt`
  from the `chrono` crate, this function could potentially return `None` in some instances,
  leading to a panic when `unwrap` was called on its result in order to return a SurrealQL
  `datetime` type to the caller of the function."
