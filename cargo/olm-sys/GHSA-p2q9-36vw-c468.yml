title: "olm-sys: wrapped library unmaintained, potentially vulnerable"
description: "After several cryptographic vulnerabilities in `libolm` were disclosed
  publicly, the Matrix Foundation has [officially deprecated the library](https://matrix.org/blog/2024/08/libolm-deprecation/).
  `olm-sys` is a thin wrapper around `libolm` and is now deprecated and potentially
  vulnerable in kind.\n\nUsers of `olm-sys` and its higher-level abstraction, `olm-rs`,
  are highly encouraged to switch to [`vodozemac`](https://crates.io/crates/vodozemac)
  as soon as possible. It is the successor effort to `libolm` and is written in Rust."
