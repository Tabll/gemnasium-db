description: "The `ImmediateIO` and `TransactionalIO` types implement `Sync` for all
  contained\n`Expander<EI>` types regardless of if the `Expander` itself is safe to
  use\nacross threads.\n\nAs the `IO` types allow retrieving the `Expander`, this
  can lead to non-thread\nsafe types being sent across threads as part of the `Expander`
  leading to data\nraces."
