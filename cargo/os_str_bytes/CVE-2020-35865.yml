title: "os_str_bytes relies on undefined behavior of `char::from_u32_unchecked`"
description: "The Windows implementation of this crate relied on the behavior of std::char::from_u32_unchecked
  when its safety clause is violated. Even though this worked with Rust versions up
  to 1.42 (at least), that behavior could change with any new Rust version, possibly
  leading a security issue.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in version 2.0.0."
