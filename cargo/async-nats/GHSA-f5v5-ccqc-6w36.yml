title: "async-nats vulnerable to TLS certificate common name validation bypass"
description: "The NATS official Rust clients are vulnerable to MitM when using TLS.\n\nThe
  common name of the server's TLS certificate is validated against the `host`name
  provided by the server's plaintext `INFO` message during the initial connection
  setup phase. A MitM proxy can tamper with the `host` field's value by substituting
  it with the common name of a valid certificate it controls, fooling the client into
  accepting it."
