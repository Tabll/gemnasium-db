title: "s2n-tls has undefined behavior at process exit"
description: "s2n-tls uses the Linux atexit function to register functions that clean
  up the global state when the process exits. In multi-threaded environments, the
  atexit handler may clean up state which is still in use by other threads. When this
  occurs, the exiting process may experience a segmentation fault or other undefined
  behavior.\n\nCustomers of AWS services do not need to take action. Applications
  using s2n-tls should upgrade to the most recent release of s2n-tls.\n\n**Impacted
  versions**: < v1.5.9."
