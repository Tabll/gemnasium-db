title: "s2n-tls has a potentially observable differences in RSA premaster secret handling"
description: "When receiving a message from a client that sent an invalid RSA premaster
  secret, an issue in s2n-tls results in the server performing additional processing
  when the premaster secret contains an incorrect client hello version. While no practical
  attack on s2n-tls has been demonstrated, this causes a small timing difference which
  could theoretically be used as described in the Marvin Attack [1].\n\nWe would like
  to thank Hubert Kario [2] for reporting this issue."
