title: "s2n-tls's mTLS API ordering may skip client authentication"
description: "An API ordering issue in s2n-tls can cause client authentication to
  unexpectedly not be enabled on the server when it otherwise appears to be. Server
  applications are impacted if client authentication is enabled by calling s2n_connection_set_config()
  before calling s2n_connection_set_client_auth_type().\n\nApplications are not impacted
  if these APIs are called in the opposite order, or if client authentication is enabled
  on the config with s2n_config_set_client_auth_type(). s2n-tls clients verifying
  server certificates are not impacted.\n\nImpacted versions: < v1.5.0."
