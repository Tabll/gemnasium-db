title: "enum_map macro can cause UB when `Enum` trait is incorrectly implemented"
description: "Affected versions of this crate did not properly check the length of
  an enum when using `enum_map!` macro, trusting user-provided length.\n\nWhen the
  `LENGTH` in the `Enum` trait does not match the array length in the `EnumArray`
  trait, this can result in the initialization of the enum map with uninitialized
  types, which in turn can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.\n\nThis problem
  can only occur with a manual implementation of the Enum trait, it will never occur
  for enums that use `#[derive(Enum)]`.\n\nExample code that triggers this vulnerability
  looks like this:\n\n```rust\nenum E {\nA,\nB,\nC,\n}\n\nimpl Enum for E {\nconst
  LENGTH: usize = 2;\n\nfn from_usize(value: usize) -> E {\nmatch value {\n0 => E::A,\n1
  => E::B,\n2 => E::C,\n_ => unimplemented!(),\n}\n}\n\nfn into_usize(self) -> usize
  {\nself as usize\n}\n}\n\nimpl<V> EnumArray<V> for E {\ntype Array = [V; 3];\n}\n\nlet
  _map: EnumMap<E, String> = enum_map! { _ => \"Hello, world!\".into() };\n```\n\nThe
  flaw was corrected in commit [b824e23](https://github.com/xfix/enum-map/commit/b824e232f2fb47837740070096ac253df8e80dfc)
  by putting `LENGTH` property on sealed trait for macro to read."
