title: "columnar: Read on uninitialized buffer may cause UB (ColumnarReadExt::read_typed_vec())"
description: "Affected versions of this crate passes an uninitialized buffer to a
  user-provided Read implementation (ColumnarReadExt::read_typed_vec()).\n\nArbitrary
  Read implementations can read from the uninitialized buffer (memory exposure) and
  also can return incorrect number of bytes written to the buffer. Reading from uninitialized
  memory produces undefined values that can quickly invoke undefined behavior."
