title: "Miner fails to get block template when a cell used as a cell dep has been
  destroyed."
description: "The RPC `get_block_template` fails when a cell has been used as a cell
  dep and an input in the different transactions.\n\nSay cell C is used as a dep group
  in the transaction A, and is destroyed in the transaction B.\n\nThe node adds transaction
  A first, then B into the transaction pool. They are both valid. But when generating
  the block template, if the fee rate of B is higher, it comes before A, which will
  invalidate A. Currently the RPC `get_block_template` will fail instead of dropping
  A."
