title: "Nervos CKB Snappy decompress length can be very large and causes out of memory
  error "
description: "Adversary can create message which compressed size is less than the
  package limit but the decompressed length is very large such as 1G. It will cost
  the node many memories to process the network messages, and on the system with less
  than 1G memory, the process is killed directly because of out of memory error."
