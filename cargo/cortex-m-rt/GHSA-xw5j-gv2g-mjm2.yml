title: "Miscompilation in cortex-m-rt 0.7.1 and 0.7.2"
description: "Version 0.7.1 of the `cortex-m-rt` crate introduced a regression causing
  the stack to NOT be eight-byte aligned prior to calling `main` (or any other specified
  entrypoint), violating the [stack ABI of AAPCS32], the default ABI used by all Cortex-M
  targets. This regression is also present in version 0.7.2 of the `cortex-m-rt` crate.\n\nThis
  regression can cause certain compiler optimizations (which assume the eight-byte
  alignment) to produce incorrect behavior at runtime. This incorrect behavior has
  been [observed in real-world applications].\n\n**It is advised that ALL users of
  `v0.7.1` and `v0.7.2` of the `cortex-m-rt` crate update to the latest version (`v0.7.3`),
  AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.** Users of `v0.7.0` and prior versions of `cortex-m-rt` are
  not affected by this regression.\n\nIt will be necessary to rebuild all affected
  firmware binaries, and flash or deploy the new firmware binaries to affected devices."
