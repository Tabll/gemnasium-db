package_slug: "cargo/async-coap"
title: "Data races in async-coap"
description: "An issue was discovered in the async-coap crate through 2020-12-08 for
  Rust.\nAffected versions of this crate implement Send/Sync for `ArcGuard<RC, T>`
  with no trait bounds on `RC`. This allows users to send `RC: !Send` to other threads
  and also allows users to concurrently access `Rc: !Sync` from multiple threads.\n\nThis
  can result in memory corruption from data race or other undefined behavior caused
  by sending `T: !Send` to other threads (e.g. dropping `MutexGuard<T>` in another
  thread that didn't lock its mutex)."
