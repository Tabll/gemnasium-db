package_slug: "cargo/soroban-sdk"
title: "soroban-sdk has overflow in Bytes::slice, Vec::slice, GenRange::gen_range
  for u64"
description: "Arithmetic overflow can be triggered in the `Bytes::slice`, `Vec::slice`,
  and `Prng::gen_range` (for `u64`) methods in the `soroban-sdk` in versions prior
  to and including `25.0.1`.\n\nContracts that pass user-controlled or computed range
  bounds to `Bytes::slice`, `Vec::slice`, or `Prng::gen_range` may silently operate
  on incorrect data ranges or generate random numbers from an unintended range, potentially
  resulting in corrupted contract state.\n\nNote that the best practice when using
  the `soroban-sdk` and building Soroban contracts is to always enable `overflow-checks
  = true`. The `stellar contract init` tool that prepares the boiler plate for a Soroban
  contract, as well as all examples and docs, encourage the use of configuring `overflow-checks
  = true` on `release` profiles so that these arithmetic operations fail rather than
  silently wrap. Contracts are only impacted if they use `overflow-checks = false`
  either explicitly or implicitly. It is anticipated the majority of contracts could
  not be impacted because the best practice encouraged by tooling is to enable `overflow-checks`."
