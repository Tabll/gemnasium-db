package_slug: "cargo/abox"
title: "Data race in abox"
description: "Affected versions of this crate implements `Send`/`Sync` for `AtomicBox<T>`
  without requiring `T: Send`/`T: Sync`. This allows to create data races to `T: !Sync`
  and send `T: !Send` to another thread. Such behavior breaks the compile-time thread
  safety guarantees of Rust, and allows users to incur undefined behavior using safe
  Rust (e.g. memory corruption from data race). The flaw was corrected in commit `34c2b9e`
  by adding trait bound `T: Send` to `Send` impl for `AtomicBox<T>` and trait bound
  `T: Sync` to `Sync` impl for `AtomicBox<T>`."
