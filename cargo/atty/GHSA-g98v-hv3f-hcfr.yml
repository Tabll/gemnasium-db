title: "atty potential unaligned read"
description: "On windows, `atty` dereferences a potentially unaligned pointer.\n\nIn
  practice however, the pointer won't be unaligned unless a custom global allocator
  is used.\n\nIn particular, the `System` allocator on windows uses `HeapAlloc`, which
  guarantees a large enough alignment."
