title: "ferris-says has undefined behavior when not using UTF-8"
description: "Affected versions receive a `&[u8]` from the caller through a safe API,
  and pass it directly to the unsafe `str::from_utf8_unchecked` function.\n\nThe behavior
  of `ferris_says::say` is undefined if the bytes from the caller don't happen to
  be valid UTF-8.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in [ferris-says#21] by using the safe
  `str::from_utf8` instead, and returning an error on invalid input. However this
  fix has not yet been published to crates.io as a patch version for 0.2.\n\nSeparately,
  [ferris-says#32] has introduced a different API for version 0.3 which accepts input
  as `&str` rather than `&[u8]`, so is unaffected by this bug.\n\n[ferris-says#21]:
