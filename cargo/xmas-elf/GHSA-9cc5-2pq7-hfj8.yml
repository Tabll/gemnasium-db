title: "xmas-elf potential out-of-bounds read with a malformed ELF file and the HashTable
  API."
description: "Affected versions of this crate only validated the `index` argument
  of `HashTable::get_bucket` and `HashTable::get_chain` against the input-controlled
  `bucket_count` and `chain_count` fields, but not against the size of the ELF section.
  As a result, a malformed ELF file could trigger out-of-bounds reads in a consumer
  of the HashTable API by setting these fields to inappropriately large values that
  would fall outside the relevant hash table section, and by introducing correspondingly
  out-of-bounds hash table indexes elsewhere in the ELF file."
