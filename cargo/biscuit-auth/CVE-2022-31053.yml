title: "Signature forgery in Biscuit"
description: "The paper [Cryptanalysis of Aggregate Γ-Signature and Practical Countermeasures
  in Application to Bitcoin](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1484) defines a way to forge
  valid Γ-signatures, an algorithm that is used in the Biscuit specification version
  1.\nIt would allow an attacker to create a token with any access level.\n\nAs Biscuit
  v1 was still an early version and not broadly deployed, we were able to contact
  all known users of Biscuit v1 and help them migrate to Biscuit v2.\nWe are not aware
  of any active exploitation of this vulnerability."
