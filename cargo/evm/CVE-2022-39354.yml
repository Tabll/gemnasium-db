title: "Incorrect is_static parameter for custom stateful precompiles in SputnikVM
  (evm)"
description: "A custom stateful precompile can use the `is_static` parameter to determine
  if the call is executed in a static context (via `STATICCALL`), and thus decide
  if stateful operations should be done. Previously, the passed `is_static` parameter
  was incorrect -- it was only set to `true` if the call comes from a **direct** `STATICCALL`
  opcode. However, once a static call context is entered, it should stay static.\n\nThe
  issue only impacts custom precompiles that actually uses `is_static`. The maintainers
  estimate the usage is low. However, for those affected, it can lead to possible
  incorrect state transitions."
