title: "Multiple memory safety issues in actix-web"
description: "Affected versions contain multiple memory safety issues, such as:\n\n-
  Unsoundly coercing immutable references to mutable references\n- Unsoundly extending
  lifetimes of strings\n- Adding the `Send` marker trait to objects that cannot be
  safely sent between threads\n\nThis may result in a variety of memory corruption
  scenarios, most likely use-after-free.\n\nA signficant refactoring effort has been
  conducted to resolve these issues."
