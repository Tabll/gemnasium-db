title: "Rust's regex crate vulnerable to regular expression denial of service"
description: "> This is a cross-post of [the official security advisory][advisory].
  The official advisory contains a signed version with our PGP key, as well.\n\n[advisory]:
  https://groups.google.com/g/rustlang-security-announcements/c/NcNNL1Jq7Yw\n\nThe
  Rust Security Response WG was notified that the `regex` crate did not properly limit
  the complexity of the regular expressions (regex) it parses. An attacker could use
  this security issue to perform a denial of service, by sending a specially crafted
  regex to a service accepting untrusted regexes. No known vulnerability is present
  when parsing untrusted input with trusted regexes.\n\nThis issue has been assigned
  CVE-2022-24713. The severity of this vulnerability is \"high\" when the `regex`
  crate is used to parse untrusted regexes. Other uses of the `regex` crate are not
  affected by this vulnerability."
