- "GHSA-g3qg-6746-3mg9"
package_slug: "cargo/risc0-circuit-rv32im"
title: "zkVM Underconstrained Vulnerability"
description: "Due to a missing constraint in the rv32im circuit, any 3-register RISC-V
  instruction (including remu and divu) in risc0-zkvm 2.0.0, 2.0.1, and 2.0.2 are
  vulnerable to an attack by a malicious prover. The main idea for the attack is to
  confuse the RISC-V virtual machine into treating the value of the rs1 register as
  the same as the rs2 register due to a lack of constraints in the rv32im circuit.\n\nThis
  vulnerability was reported by Christoph Hochrainer via our Hackenproof bug bounty."
