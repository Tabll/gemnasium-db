title: "Mithril snapshots for Cardano database could be compromised by an adversary"
description: "Inconsistencies could be introduced into a tampered ledger state distributed
 through Mithril snapshots, either by an unknown source or by a compromised IOG-operated 
 aggregator. These inconsistencies would not be immediately detected by Cardano nodes 
 started with such snapshots, potentially enabling long-range attacks that might not 
 be corrected by honest nodes, even if they sync from genesis.

 Currently, a Mithril network has only one aggregator, which serves snapshots from a 
 secure cloud location operated by IOG and is therefore assumed to be trustworthy. In 
 the future, as Mithril networks become more decentralized, multiple aggregators will operate
 independently. This increased decentralization could raise the risk of a malicious aggregator 
 distributing a tampered ledger state."
