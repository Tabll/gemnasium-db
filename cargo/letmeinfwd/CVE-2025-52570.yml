title: "letmein connection limiter allows an arbitrary amount of simultaneous connections"
description: "The connection limiter is implemented incorrectly.\nIt allows an arbitrary
  amount of simultaneously incoming connections (TCP, UDP and Unix socket) for the
  services `letmeind` and `letmeinfwd`.\nTherefore, the command line option `num-connections`
  is not effective and does not limit the number of simultaneously incoming connections.\n\n`letmeind`
  is the public network facing daemon (TCP/UDP).\n\n`letmeinfwd` is the internal firewall
  daemon that only listens on local Unix socket.\n\nPossible Denial Of Service by
  resource exhaustion."
