title: "jsonwebtoken has Type Confusion that leads to potential authorization bypass"
description: "It has been discovered that there is a Type Confusion vulnerability
  in jsonwebtoken, specifically, in its claim validation logic.\n\nWhen a standard
  claim (such as nbf or exp) is provided with an incorrect JSON type (Like a String
  instead of a Number), the library’s internal parsing mechanism marks the claim as
  “FailedToParse”. Crucially, the validation logic treats this “FailedToParse” state
  identically to “NotPresent”.\n\nThis means that if a check is enabled (like: validate_nbf
  = true), but the claim is not explicitly marked as required in required_spec_claims,
  the library will skip the validation check entirely for the malformed claim, treating
  it as if it were not there. This allows attackers to bypass critical time-based
  security restrictions (like “Not Before” checks) and commit potential authentication
  and authorization bypasses."
