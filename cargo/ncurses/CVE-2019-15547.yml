package_slug: "cargo/ncurses"
title: "Mishandling of format strings in ncurses"
description: "ncurses exposes functions from the ncurses library which:\n* Pass buffers
  without length to C functions that may write an arbitrary amount of data, leading
  to a buffer overflow. (instr, mvwinstr, etc)\n* Passes rust &str to strings expecting
  C format arguments, allowing hostile input to execute a format string attack, which
  trivially allows writing arbitrary data to stack memory (functions in the printw
  family)."
