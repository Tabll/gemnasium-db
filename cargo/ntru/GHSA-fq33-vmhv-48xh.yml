title: "ntru-rs has unsound FFI: Wrong API usage causes write past allocated area"
description: "The following usage causes undefined behavior.\n```rust\nlet kp: ntru::types::KeyPair
  = â€¦;\nkp.get_public().export(Default::default())\n```\n\nWhen compiled with debug
  assertions, the code above will trigger a `attempt to subtract with overflow` panic
  before UB occurs.\nOther mistakes (e.g. using `EncParams` from a different key)
  may always trigger UB.\n\nLikely, older versions of this crate are also affected,
  but have not been tested."
