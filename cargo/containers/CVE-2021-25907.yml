package_slug: "cargo/containers"
title: "Double free in containers"
description: "Upon panic in a user-provided function f, fn mutate() & fn mutate2 drops
  twice a same object.\n\nAffected versions of this crate did not guard against double
  drop while temporarily duplicating an object's ownership with ptr::read().\n\nDropping
  a same object can result in memory corruption.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in version
  \"0.9.11\" by fixing the code to abort upon panic."
