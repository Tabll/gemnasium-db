title: "Unsoundness in anstream"
description: "When given a valid UTF8 string \"Ã¶\\x1bðŸ˜€\", the function in crates/anstream/src/adapter/strip.rs
  will be confused. The UTF8 bytes are \\xc3\\xb6 then \\x1b then \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x80.\n\nWhen
  looping over \"non-printable bytes\" \\x1b\\xf0 will be considered as some non-printable
  sequence.\n\nThis will produce a broken str from the incorrectly segmented bytes
  via str::from_utf8_unchecked, and that should never happen.\n\nFull credit goes
  to @Ralith who reviewed this code and asked @burakemir to follow up."
