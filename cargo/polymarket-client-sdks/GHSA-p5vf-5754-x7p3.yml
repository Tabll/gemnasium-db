title: "`polymarket-client-sdks` was removed from crates.io for malicious code"
description: "It appeared to be typosquatting existing crate [`polymarket-client-sdk`](https://crates.io/crates/polymarket-client-sdk)
  (`sdks` vs `sdk`) and attempting to steal credentials from local files.\n\nThe malicious
  crate had 1 version published on 2026-02-09 and had been downloaded only 33 times.
  There were no crates depending on this crate on crates.io.\n\nThanks to Roland Peelen
  for finding and reporting this to the crates.io team!"
