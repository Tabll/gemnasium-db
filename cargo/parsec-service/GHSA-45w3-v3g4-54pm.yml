title: "Chrono has potential segfault issue in SPIFFE authenticator"
description: "Several vulnerabilities have been reported in the `time` and `chrono`
  crates related to handling of calls to `localtime_r`. You can follow some of the
  discussions [here](https://github.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/602) and [here](https://github.com/time-rs/time/issues/293),
  and the associated CVE [here](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26235).
  In our case, the issue with the dependency was flagged by our nightly CI build running
  [`cargo-audit`](https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec/issues/544).\n\nThe vulnerability
  leads to a segfault in specific circumstances - namely, when one of a number of
  functions in the `time` crate is called while any other thread is setting an environment
  variable. Given that in the case of the Parsec service this affects the SPIFFE authenticator,
  Parsec service users can encounter the issue only when the JWT SVID authenticator
  is enabled and being used. We have not undergone any manual tracing to understand
  if the vulnerable methods are called anywhere in our stack, however it seems reasonable
  to expect that if that were to be the case, the issue would lie in JWT validation
  (i.e. when handling the dates found within a Json Web Token). JWT validation could
  thus fail, bringing down the thread in which the request happens. The rest of the
  threads continue to work. Since the threadpool implementation that we use [continues
  replenishing the pool](https://docs.rs/threadpool/latest/threadpool/) when one thread
  panics, the impact on the service should be minimal."
