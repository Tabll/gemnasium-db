title: "Singleton lacks bounds on Send and Sync."
description: "`Singleton<T>` is meant to be a static object that can be initialized
  lazily. In\norder to satisfy the requirement that `static` items must implement
  `Sync`,\n`Singleton` implemented both `Sync` and `Send` unconditionally.\n\nThis
  allows for a bug where non-`Sync` types such as `Cell` can be used in\nsingletons
  and cause data races in concurrent programs.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in commit
  `b0d2bd20e` by adding trait bounds, requiring\nthe contaiend type to implement `Sync`."
