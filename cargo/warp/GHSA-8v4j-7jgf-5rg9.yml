title: "Warp vulnerable to Path Traversal via Improper validation of Windows paths"
description: "Path resolution in `warp::filters::fs::dir` didn't correctly validate
  Windows paths meaning paths like `/foo/bar/c:/windows/web/screen/img101.png` would
  be allowed and respond with the contents of `c:/windows/web/screen/img101.png`.
  Thus users could potentially read files anywhere on the filesystem.\n\nThis only
  impacts Windows. Linux and other unix likes are not impacted by this."
