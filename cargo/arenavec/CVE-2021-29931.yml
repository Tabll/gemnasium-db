title: "Double free in arenavec"
description: "Affected versions of this crate did not guard against potential panics
  that may happen from user-provided functions T::default() and T::drop().\n\nPanic
  within T::default() leads to dropping uninitialized T, when it is invoked from common::Slice::<T,
  H>::new(). Panic within T::drop() leads to double drop of T, when it is invoked
  either from common::SliceVec::<T, H>::resize_with() or common::SliceVec::<T, H>::resize()\n\nEither
  case causes memory corruption in the heap memory."
