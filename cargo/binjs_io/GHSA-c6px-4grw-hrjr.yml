title: "'Read' on uninitialized memory may cause UB"
description: "Affected versions of this crate passes an uninitialized buffer to a
  user-provided `Read` implementation. The crate currently contains 4 occurrences
  of such cases. Arbitrary `Read` implementations can read from the uninitialized
  buffer (memory exposure) and also can return incorrect number of bytes written to
  the buffer.\nReading from uninitialized memory produces undefined values that can
  quickly invoke undefined behavior."
