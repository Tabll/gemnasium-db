title: "Mimalloc Can Allocate Memory with Bad Alignment"
description: "This crate depended on a promise regarding alignments made by the author
  of the mimalloc allocator to avoid using aligned allocation functions where possible
  for performance reasons.\nSince then, the mimalloc allocator's logic changed, making
  it break this promise.\nThis caused this crate to return memory with an incorrect
  alignment for some allocations, particularly those with large alignments.\nThe flaw
  was fixed by always using the aligned allocation functions."
