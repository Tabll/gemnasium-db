package_slug: "cargo/yaml-rust"
title: "Uncontrolled recursion in rust-yaml"
description: "Affected versions of this crate did not prevent deep recursion while
  deserializing data structures. This allows an attacker to make a YAML file with
  deeply nested structures that causes an abort while deserializing it. The flaw was
  corrected by checking the recursion depth."
