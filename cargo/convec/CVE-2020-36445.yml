package_slug: "cargo/convec"
title: "Data races in convec"
description: "Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implement Send/Sync
  for `ConVec<T>`.\nThis allows users to insert `T` that is not Send or not Sync.\n\nThis
  allows users to create data races by using non-Send types like `Arc<Cell<_>>` or
  `Rc<_>` as `T` in `ConVec<T>`. It is also possible to create data races by using
  types like `Cell<_>` or `RefCell<_>` as `T` (types that are `Send` but not `Sync`).\nSuch
  data races can lead to memory corruption."
