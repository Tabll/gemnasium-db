title: "maxminddb's `Reader::open_mmap` unsoundly marks unsafe memmap operation as
  safe"
description: "maxminddb prior to version 0.27 declared `Reader::open_mmap` as safe
  despite wrapping an inherently unsafe memmap2 operation with no extra step done
  to guarantee safety. This could have led to undefined behaviour if the file were
  to be modified on disk while the memory map was still active."
