title: "matrix-sdk-crypto vulnerable to sender of encrypted events being spoofed by
  homeserver administrator"
description: "matrix-sdk-crypto since version 0.8.0 up to 0.11.0 does not correctly
  validate the sender of an encrypted event. Accordingly, a malicious homeserver operator
  can modify events served to clients, making those events appear to the recipient
  as if they were sent by another user.\n\nAlthough the CVSS score is 4.9 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N),
  we consider this a High Severity security issue."
