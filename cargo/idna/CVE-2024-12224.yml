title: "`idna` accepts Punycode labels that do not produce any non-ASCII when decoded"
description: "`idna` 0.5.0 and earlier accepts Punycode labels that do not produce
  any non-ASCII output, which means that either ASCII labels or the empty root label
  can be masked such that they appear unequal without IDNA processing or when processed
  with a different implementation and equal when processed with `idna` 0.5.0 or earlier.\n\nConcretely,
  `example.org` and `xn--example-.org` become equal after processing by `idna` 0.5.0
  or earlier. Also, `example.org.xn--` and `example.org.` become equal after processing
  by `idna` 0.5.0 or earlier.\n\nIn applications using `idna` (but not in `idna` itself)
  this may be able to lead to privilege escalation when host name comparison is part
  of a privilege check and the behavior is combined with a client that resolves domains
  with such labels instead of treating them as errors that preclude DNS resolution
  / URL fetching and with the attacker managing to introduce a DNS entry (and TLS
  certificate) for an `xn--`-masked name that turns into the name of the target when
  processed by `idna` 0.5.0 or earlier."
