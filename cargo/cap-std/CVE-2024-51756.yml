package_slug: "cargo/cap-std"
title: "cap-std doesn't fully sandbox all the Windows device filenames"
description: "cap-std's filesystem sandbox implementation on Windows blocks access
  to special device filenames such as \"COM1\", \"COM2\", \"LPT0\", \"LPT1\", and
  so on, however it did not block access to the special device filenames which use
  superscript digits, such as \"COM¹\", \"COM²\", \"LPT⁰\", \"LPT¹\", and so on. Untrusted
  filesystem paths could bypass the sandbox and access devices through those special
  device filenames with superscript digits, and through them provide access peripheral
  devices connected to the computer, or network resources mapped to those devices.
  This can include modems, printers, network printers, and any other device connected
  to a serial or parallel port, including emulated USB serial ports."
