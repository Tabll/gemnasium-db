title: "Out of bounds write in prost"
description: "Affected versions of this crate contained a bug in which decoding untrusted
  input could overflow the stack. On architectures with stack probes (like x86), this
  can be used for denial of service attacks, while on architectures without stack
  probes (like ARM) overflowing the stack is unsound and can result in potential memory
  corruption (or even RCE)."
