package_slug: "cargo/noise_search"
title: "Data races in noise_search"
description: "Affected versions of the `noise_search` crate unconditionally implement
  Send/Sync for `MvccRwLock`.\nThis can lead to data races when types that are either
  `!Send` or `!Sync` (e.g. `Rc<T>`, `Arc<Cell<_>>`) are contained inside `MvccRwLock`
  and sent across thread boundaries. The data races can potentially lead to memory
  corruption (as demonstrated in the PoC from the original report issue).\n\nAlso,
  safe APIs of `MvccRwLock` allow aliasing violations by allowing `&T` and `LockResult<MutexGuard<Box<T>>>`
  to co-exist in conflicting lifetime regions. The APIs of `MvccRwLock` should either
  be marked as `unsafe` or `MbccRwLock` should be changed to private or pub(crate)."
