title: "Matrix Rust SDK vulnerable to SQL Injection through its EventCache implementation"
description: "An SQL injection vulnerability in the `EventCache::find_event_with_relations`
  method of matrix-sdk 0.11 and 0.12 allows malicious room members to execute arbitrary
  SQL commands in Matrix clients that directly pass relation types provided by those
  room members into this method, when used with the default sqlite-based store backend.
  Exploitation is unlikely, as no known clients currently use the API in this manner."
