title: "SM2-PKE has 32-bit Biased Nonce Vulnerability"
description: "A critical vulnerability exists in the SM2 Public Key Encryption (PKE)
  implementation where the ephemeral nonce `k` is generated with severely reduced
  entropy. A unit mismatch error causes the nonce generation function to request only
  32 bits of randomness instead of the expected 256 bits. This reduces the security
  of the encryption from a 128-bit level to a trivial 16-bit level, allowing a practical
  attack to recover the nonce `k` and decrypt any ciphertext **given only the public
  key and ciphertext**."
