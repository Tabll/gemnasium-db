package_slug: "cargo/sm2"
title: "SM2-PKE has Unchecked AffinePoint Decoding (unwrap) in decrypt()"
description: "A denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the SM2 PKE decryption path
  where an invalid elliptic-curve point (C1) is decoded and the resulting value is
  unwrapped without checking. Specifically, `AffinePoint::from_encoded_point(&encoded_c1)`
  may return a `None`/`CtOption::None` when the supplied coordinates are syntactically
  valid but do not lie on the SM2 curve. The calling code previously used `.unwrap()`,
  causing a panic when presented with such input."
