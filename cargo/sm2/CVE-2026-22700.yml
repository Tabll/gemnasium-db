title: "RustCrypto Has Insufficient Length Validation in decrypt() in SM2-PKE"
description: "A denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the SM2 public-key encryption
  (PKE) implementation: the `decrypt()` path performs unchecked `slice::split_at`
  operations on input buffers derived from untrusted ciphertext. An attacker can submit
  short/undersized ciphertext or carefully-crafted DER-encoded structures to trigger
  bounds-check panics (Rust unwinding) which crash the calling thread or process."
