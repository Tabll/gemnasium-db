title: "quiche vulnerable to unbounded storage of information related to connection
  ID retirement"
description: "Cloudflare quiche was discovered to be vulnerable to unbounded storage
  of information related to connection ID retirement, which could lead to excessive
  resource consumption. Each QUIC connection possesses a set of connection Identifiers
  (IDs); see [RFC 9000 Section 5.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000#section-5.1).
  Endpoints declare the number of active connection IDs they are willing to support
  using the active_connection_id_limit transport parameter. The peer can create new
  IDs using a NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame but must stay within the active ID limit. This
  is done by retirement of old IDs, the endpoint sends NEW_CONNECTION_ID includes
  a value in the retire_prior_to field, which elicits a RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame
  as confirmation. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability
  by sending NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames and manipulating the connection (e.g. by restricting
  the peer's congestion window size) so that RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frames can only
  be sent at a slower rate than they are received, leading to storage of information
  related to connection IDs in an unbounded queue."
