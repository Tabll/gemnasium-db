title: "Unbounded queuing of path validation messages in cloudflare-quiche"
description: "quiche v. 0.15.0 through 0.19.0 was discovered to be vulnerable to unbounded
  queuing of path validation messages, which could lead to excessive resource consumption.\n\nQUIC
  path validation ([RFC 9000 Section 8.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000#section-8.2))
  requires that the recipient of a PATH_CHALLENGE frame responds by sending a PATH_RESPONSE.
  An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending PATH_CHALLENGE
  frames and manipulating the connection (e.g. by restricting the peer's congestion
  window size) so that PATH_RESPONSE frames can only be sent at the slower rate than
  they are received, leading to storage of path validation data in an unbounded queue."
