title: "Cargo prior to Rust 1.26.0 may download the wrong dependency"
description: "Cargo prior to Rust 1.26.0 may download the wrong dependency if your
  package.toml file uses the `package` configuration key. Usage of the `package` key
  to rename dependencies in `Cargo.toml` is ignored in Rust 1.25.0 and prior. When
  Rust 1.25.0 and prior is used Cargo may download the wrong dependency, which could
  be squatted on crates.io to be a malicious package. This not only affects manifests
  that you write locally yourself, but also manifests published to crates.io. Rust
  1.0.0 through Rust 1.25.0 is affected by this advisory because Cargo will ignore
  the `package` key in manifests. Rust 1.26.0 through Rust 1.30.0 are not affected
  and typically will emit an error because the `package` key is unstable. Rust 1.31.0
  and after are not affected because Cargo understands the `package` key. Users of
  the affected versions are strongly encouraged to update their compiler to the latest
  available one. Preventing this issue from happening requires updating your compiler
  to be either Rust 1.26.0 or newer. There will be no point release for Rust versions
  prior to 1.26.0. Users of Rust 1.19.0 to Rust 1.25.0 can instead apply linked patches
  to mitigate the issue."
