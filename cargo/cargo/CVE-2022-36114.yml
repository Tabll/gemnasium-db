title: "Cargo extracting malicious crates can fill the file system"
description: "The Rust Security Response WG was notified that Cargo did not prevent
  extracting some malformed packages downloaded from alternate registries. An attacker
  able to upload packages to an alternate registry could fill the file system when
  Cargo downloaded the package.\n\nThe severity of this vulnerability is \"low\" for
  users of alternate registries. Users relying on crates.io are not affected.\n\nNote
  that **by design** Cargo allows code execution at build time, due to build scripts
  and procedural macros. The vulnerabilities in this advisory allow performing a subset
  of the possible damage in a harder to track down way. Your dependencies must still
  be trusted if you want to be protected from attacks, as it's possible to perform
  the same attacks with build scripts and procedural macros."
