package_slug: "cargo/async-h1"
title: "Async-h1 request smuggling possible with long unread bodies"
description: "This vulnerability affects any webserver that uses async-h1 behind a
  reverse proxy, including all such Tide applications.\n\nIf the server does not read
  the body of a request which is longer than some buffer length, async-h1 will attempt
  to read a subsequent request from the body content starting at that offset into
  the body.\n\nOne way to exploit this vulnerability would be for an adversary to
  craft a request such that the body contains a request that would not be noticed
  by a reverse proxy, allowing it to forge forwarded/x-forwarded headers. If an application
  trusted the authenticity of these headers, it could be misled by the smuggled request.\n\nAnother
  potential concern with this vulnerability is that if a reverse proxy is sending
  multiple http clients' requests along the same keep-alive connection, it would be
  possible for the smuggled request to specify a long content and capture another
  user's request in its body. This content could be captured in a post request to
  an endpoint that allows the content to be subsequently retrieved by the adversary."
