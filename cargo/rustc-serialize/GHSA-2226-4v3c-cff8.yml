title: "Stack overflow in rustc_serialize when parsing deeply nested JSON"
description: "When parsing JSON using `json::Json::from_str`, there is no limit to
  the depth of the stack, therefore deeply nested objects can cause a stack overflow,
  which aborts the process.\n\nExample code that triggers the vulnerability is\n\n```rust\nfn
  main() {\nlet _ = rustc_serialize::json::Json::from_str(&\"[0,[\".repeat(10000));\n}\n```\n\n[serde](https://crates.io/crates/serde)
  is recommended as a replacement to rustc_serialize."
