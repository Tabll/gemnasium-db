title: "DoS Vulnerability from Upstream Actix Web Issues"
description: "This vulnerability affects all users of the `perseus deploy` functionality
  who have not exported their sites to static files. If you are using the inbuilt
  Perseus server in production, there is a memory leak in Actix Web stemming from
  [this upstream issue](https://github.com/actix/actix-web/issues/1780) which can
  allow even a single user to cause the process to exhaust its memory on low-memory
  servers by continuously reloading the page. Note that this issue does not affect
  all Actix Web applications, but rather results from certain usage patterns which
  appear to be present in Perseus' server mechanics."
