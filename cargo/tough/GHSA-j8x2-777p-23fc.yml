title: "tough cyclic delegation graphs are not detected"
description: "In a TUF repository, the targets roleâ€™s signature indicates which target
  files are trusted by clients. The role can delegate full or partial trust to other
  roles, meaning that that role is trusted to sign target file metadata. Delegated
  roles can further delegate trust to other delegated roles. When searching for metadata
  about a given target, tough failed to detect cyclical role delegations."
