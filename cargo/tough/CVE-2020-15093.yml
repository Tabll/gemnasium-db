package_slug: "cargo/tough"
title: "Improper verification of signature threshold in tough"
description: "The tough library, prior to 0.7.1, does not properly verify the uniqueness
  of keys in the signatures provided to meet the threshold of cryptographic signatures.
  It allows someone with access to a valid signing key to create multiple valid signatures
  in order to circumvent TUF requiring a minimum threshold of unique keys before the
  metadata is considered valid.\n\nAWS would like to thank Erick Tryzelaar of the
  Google Fuchsia Team for reporting this issue."
