package_slug: "cargo/tough"
title: "tough failure to detect delegated target rollback"
description: "When updating the snapshot role, TUF clients should ensure that any
  previously encountered targets or delegated targets metadata files continue to be
  present in new snapshot metadata files. Likewise, the new targets and delegated
  targets metadata versions must be greater than or equal to the previously encountered
  versions. While tough will perform this check for targets metadata files, it did
  not perform this check for delegated targets files."
