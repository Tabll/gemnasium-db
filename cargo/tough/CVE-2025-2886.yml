package_slug: "cargo/tough"
title: "tough terminating targets role delegations are not respected"
description: "Delegations are a mechanism defined by the TUF specification that allow
  multiple different identities to provide and sign content within a single repository.
  Terminating delegations and delegation priority give a TUF repository unambiguous
  control over how overlapping delegations are resolved. tough erroneously will not
  terminate a search as required, and will accept information from a lower-priority
  delegation that should have been ignored."
