title: "tough timestamp metadata is cached when it fails snapshot rollback check"
description: "TUF repositories use the timestamp role to protect against rollback
  events by enabling an automated process to periodically sign the role's metadata.
  While tough will ensure that the version of snapshot metadata in new timestamp metadata
  files was always greater than or equal to the previously trusted version, it will
  only do so after persisting the timestamp metadata to its cache."
