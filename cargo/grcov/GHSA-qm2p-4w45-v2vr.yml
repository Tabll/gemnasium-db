title: "grcov has an out of bounds write triggered by crafted coverage data"
description: "Function `grcov::covdir::get_coverage` uses the `unsafe` function `get_unchecked_mut`
  without validating that the index is in bounds.\n\nThis results in memory corruption,
  and could potentially allow arbitrary code execution provided that an attacker can
  feed the tool crafted coverage data."
