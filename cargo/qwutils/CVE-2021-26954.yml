title: "insert_slice_clone can double drop if Clone panics."
description: "Affected versions of this crate used ptr::copy when inserting into the
  middle of a Vec. When ownership was temporarily duplicated during this copy, it
  calls the clone method of a user provided element.\n\nThis issue can result in an
  element being double-freed if the clone call panics.\n\nCommit `20cb73d` fixed this
  issue by adding a set_len(0) call before operating on the vector to avoid dropping
  the elements during a panic."
