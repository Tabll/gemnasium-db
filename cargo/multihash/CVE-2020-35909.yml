title: "Unexpected panic in multihash"
description: "In versions prior 0.11.3 it's possible to make from_slice panic by feeding
  it certain malformed input. It's never documented that from_slice (and from_bytes
  which wraps it) can panic, and its' return type (Result<Self, DecodeError>) suggests
  otherwise. In practice, from_slice/from_bytes is frequently used in networking code
  and is being called with unsanitized data from untrusted sources. This can allow
  attackers to cause DoS by causing an unexpected panic in the network client's code.."
