description: "### Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it
  is a duplicate of GHSA-m65q-v92h-cm7q. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n### Original Description\nA flaw was found in the user's crate for
  Rust. This vulnerability allows privilege escalation via incorrect group listing
  when a user or process has fewer than exactly 1024 groups, leading to the erroneous
  inclusion of the root group in the access list."
