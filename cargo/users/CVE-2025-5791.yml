title: "users may append `root` to group listings"
description: "Affected versions append `root` to group listings, unless the correct
  listing has exactly 1024 groups.\n\nThis affects both:\n\n- The supplementary groups
  of a user\n- The group access list of the current process\n\nIf the caller uses
  this information for access control, this may lead to privilege escalation.\n\nThis
  crate is not currently maintained, so a patched version is not available.\n\nVersions
  older than 0.8.0 do not contain the affected functions, so downgrading to them is
  a workaround."
