title: "Users vulnerable to unaligned read of `*const *const c_char` pointer"
description: "Affected versions dereference a potentially unaligned pointer. The pointer
  is commonly unaligned in practice, resulting in undefined behavior.\n\nIn some build
  modes, this is observable as a panic followed by abort. In other build modes the
  UB may manifest in some other way, including the possibility of working correctly
  in some architectures.\n\nThe crate is not currently maintained, so a patched version
  is not available."
