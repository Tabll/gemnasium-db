title: "astral-tokio-tar Vulnerable to PAX Header Desynchronization"
description: "Versions of `astral-tokio-tar` prior to 0.5.6 contain a boundary parsing
  vulnerability that allows attackers to smuggle additional archive entries by exploiting
  inconsistent PAX/ustar header handling. When processing archives with PAX-extended
  headers containing size overrides, the parser incorrectly advances stream position
  based on ustar header size (often zero) instead of the PAX-specified size, causing
  it to interpret file content as legitimate tar headers.\n\nThis vulnerability was
  disclosed to multiple Rust tar parsers, all derived from the original `async-tar`
  fork of `tar-rs`."
