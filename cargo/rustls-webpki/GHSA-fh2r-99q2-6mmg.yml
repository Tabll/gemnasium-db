title: "rustls-webpki: CPU denial of service in certificate path building"
description: "When this crate is given a pathological certificate chain to validate,
  it will spend CPU time exponential with the number of candidate certificates at
  each step of path building.\n\nBoth TLS clients and TLS servers that accept client
  certificate are affected.\n\nWe now give each path building operation a budget of
  100 signature verifications.\n\nThe original `webpki` crate is also affected, see
  [GHSA-8qv2-5vq6-g2g7](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8qv2-5vq6-g2g7).\n\nThis
  was previously reported in the original crate <https://github.com/briansmith/webpki/issues/69>
  and re-reported to us recently."
