package_slug: "cargo/conqueue"
title: "Data race in conqueue"
description: "Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implemented `Send`/`Sync`
  for `QueueSender<T>`, allowing to send non-Send `T` to other threads by invoking
  `(&QueueSender<T>).send()`.\n\nThis fails to prevent users from creating data races
  by sending types like `Rc<T>` or `Arc<Cell<T>>` to other threads, which can lead
  to memory corruption. The flaw was corrected in commit `1e462c3` by imposing `T:
  Send` to both `Send`/`Sync` impls for `QueueSender<T>`/`QueueReceiver<T>`."
