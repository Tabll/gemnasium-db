package_slug: "cargo/ethereum"
title: "ethereum does not check transaction malleability for EIP-2930, EIP-1559 and
  EIP-7702 transactions"
description: "Prior to `ethereum` crate v0.18.0, signature malleability (according
  to EIP-2) was only checked for \"legacy\" transactions, but not for EIP-2930, EIP-1559
  and EIP-7702 transactions.\n\nThis is a specification deviation and therefore a
  high severity advisory if the `ethereum` crate is used for Ethereum mainnet. Note
  that signature malleability itself is not a security issue, and therefore if the
  `ethereum` crate is used on a single-implementation blockchain, it's a low/informational
  severity advisory."
