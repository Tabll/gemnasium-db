title: "Parsing borsh messages with ZST which are not-copy/clone is unsound"
description: "Affected versions of borsh cause undefined behavior when zero-sized-types
  (ZST) are parsed and the Copy/Clone traits are not implemented/derived. For instance
  if 1000 instances of a ZST are deserialized, and the ZST is not copy (this can be
  achieved through a singleton), then accessing/writing to deserialized data will
  cause a segmentation fault.\n\nThere is currently no way for borsh to read data
  without also providing a Rust type. Therefore, if you are not using ZST for serialization,
  then you are not affected by this issue."
