package_slug: "cargo/claxon"
title: "Uninitialized memory exposure in claxon"
description: "Affected versions of Claxon made an invalid assumption about the decode
  buffer size being a multiple of a value read from the bitstream. This could cause
  parts of the decode buffer to not be overwritten. If the decode buffer was newly
  allocated and uninitialized, this uninitialized memory could be exposed.\n\nThis
  allows an attacker to observe parts of the uninitialized memory in the decoded audio
  stream.\n\nThe flaw was corrected by checking that the value read from the bitstream
  divides the decode buffer size, and returning a format error if it does not. If
  an error is returned, the decode buffer is not exposed. Regression tests and an
  additional fuzzer have been added to prevent similar flaws in the future."
