package_slug: "cargo/conquer-once"
title: "Data races in conquer-once"
description: "Affected versions of conquer-once implements Sync for its OnceCell type
  without restricting it to Sendable types.\n\nThis allows non-Send but Sync types
  such as MutexGuard to be sent across threads leading to undefined behavior and memory
  corruption in concurrent programs.\n\nThe issue was fixed by adding a Send constraint
  to OnceCell."
