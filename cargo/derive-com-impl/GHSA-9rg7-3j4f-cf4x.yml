title: "QueryInterface should call AddRef before returning pointer"
description: "Affected version of this crate, which is a required dependency in com-impl,\nprovides
  a faulty implementation of the `IUnknown::QueryInterface` method.\n\n`QueryInterface`
  implementation must call `IUnknown::AddRef` before returning the pointer,\nas describe
  in this documentation:\n<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/unknwn/nf-unknwn-iunknown-queryinterface(refiid_void)>\n\nAs
  it is not incrementing the refcount as expected, the following calls to `IUnknown::Release`
  method\nwill cause WMI to drop reference to the interface, and can lead to invalid
  reference."
