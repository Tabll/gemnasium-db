title: "Data races in model"
description: "`Shared` data structure in `model` crate implements `Send` and `Sync`
  traits regardless of the inner type.\nThis allows safe Rust code to trigger a data
  race, which is undefined behavior in Rust.\n\nUsers are advised to treat `Shared`
  as an unsafe type.\nIt should not be used outside of the testing context,\nand care
  must be taken so that the testing code does not have a data race\nbesides a race
  condition that is expected to be caught by the test."
