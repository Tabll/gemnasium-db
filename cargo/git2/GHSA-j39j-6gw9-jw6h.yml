title: "git2 has potential undefined behavior when dereferencing Buf struct "
description: "If the Buf struct is dereferenced immediately after calling new() or
  default() on the Buf struct, a null pointer is passed to the unsafe function slice::from_raw_parts.
  According to the safety section documentation of the function, data must be non-null
  and aligned even for zero-length slices or slices of ZSTs. Thus, passing a null
  pointer will lead to undefined behavior."
