package_slug: "cargo/late-static"
title: "Data races in late-static"
description: "Affected versions of this crate implemented Sync for LateStatic with
  T: Send, so that it is possible to create a data race to a type T: Send + !Sync
  (e.g. Cell<T>).\n\nThis can result in a memory corruption or other kinds of undefined
  behavior.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in commit 11f396c by replacing the T: Send bound
  to T: Sync bound in the Sync impl for LateStatic<T>."
