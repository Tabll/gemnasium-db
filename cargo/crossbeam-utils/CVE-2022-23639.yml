title: "crossbeam-utils Unsoundness of AtomicCell<{i,u}64> arithmetics on 32-bit targets
  that support Atomic{I,U}64"
description: "The affected versions of this crate incorrectly assumed that the alignment
  of `{i,u}64` was always the same as `Atomic{I,U}64`.\n\nHowever, the alignment of
  `{i,u}64` on a 32-bit target can be smaller than `Atomic{I,U}64`.\n\nThis can cause
  the following problems:\n\n- Unaligned memory accesses\n- Data race\n\nCrates using
  `fetch_*` methods with `AtomicCell<{i,u}64>` are affected by this issue.\n\n32-bit
  targets without `Atomic{I,U}64` and 64-bit targets are not affected by this issue.\n32-bit
  targets with `Atomic{I,U}64` and `{i,u}64` have the same alignment are also not
  affected by this issue.\n\nThe following is a complete list of the builtin targets
  that may be affected. (last update: nightly-2022-02-11)\n\n- armv7-apple-ios (tier
