title: "Wasmtime CLI  is vulnerable to host panic through its fd_renumber function"
description: "A bug in Wasmtime's implementation of the WASIp1 set of import functions
  can lead to a WebAssembly guest inducing a panic in the host (embedder).\nThe specific
  bug is triggered by calling `path_open` after calling `fd_renumber` with either:\n-
  two equal argument values\n- second argument being equal to a previously-closed
  file descriptor number value\n\nThe corrupt state introduced in `fd_renumber` will
  lead to the subsequent opening of a file descriptor to panic. This panic cannot
  introduce memory unsafety or allow WebAssembly to break outside of its sandbox,
  however. There is no possible heap corruption or memory unsafety from this panic.\n\nThis
  bug is in the implementation of Wasmtime's `wasmtime-wasi` crate which provides
  an implementation of WASIp1. The bug requires a specially crafted call to `fd_renumber`
  in addition to the ability to open a subsequent file descriptor. Opening a second
  file descriptor is only possible when a preopened directory was provided to the
  guest, and this is common amongst embeddings. A panic in the host is considered
  a denial-of-service vector for WebAssembly embedders and is thus a security issue
  in Wasmtime.\n\nThis bug does not affect WASIp2 and embedders using components."
