title: "fast-fault has a segmentation fault due to lack of bound check"
description: "In this case, the \"fast_float::common::AsciiStr::first\" method within
  the \"AsciiStr\" struct\nuses the unsafe keyword to reading from memory without
  performing bounds checking.\nSpecifically, it directly dereferences a pointer offset
  by \"self.ptr\".\nBecause of the above reason, the method accesses invalid memory
  address when it takes an empty string as its input.\nThis approach violates Rustâ€™s
  memory safety guarantees, as it can lead to invalid memory access if empty buffer
  is provided.\n\nNo patched version for fast-float crate has been released, but a
  patch is available in the fast-float2 fork."
