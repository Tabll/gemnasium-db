package_slug: "cargo/pallet-ethereum"
title: "Validity check missing in Frontier"
description: "In the newly introduced signed Frontier-specific extrinsic for `pallet-ethereum`,
  a large part of transaction validation logic was only called in transaction pool
  validation, but not in block execution. Malicious validators can take advantage
  of this to put invalid transactions into a block.\n\nThe attack is limited in that
  the signature is always validated, and the majority of the validation is done again
  in the subsequent `pallet-evm` execution logic. However, do note that a chain ID
  replay attack was possible. In addition, spamming attacks are of main concerns,
  while they are limited by Substrate block size limits and other factors."
