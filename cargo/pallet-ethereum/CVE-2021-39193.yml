title: "Transaction validity oversight in pallet-ethereum"
description: "A bug in `pallet-ethereum` can cause invalid transactions to be included
  in the Ethereum block state in `pallet-ethereum` due to not validating the input
  data size. Any invalid transactions included this way have no possibility to alter
  the internal Ethereum or Substrate state. The transaction will appear to have be
  included, but is of no effect as it is rejected by the EVM engine. The impact is
  further limited by Substrate extrinsic size constraints."
