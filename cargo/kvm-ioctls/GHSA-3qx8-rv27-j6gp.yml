title: "Undefined behaviour in `kvm_ioctls::ioctls::vm::VmFd::create_device`"
description: "An issue was identified in the `VmFd::create_device function`, leading
  to undefined behavior and miscompilations on rustc 1.82.0 and newer due to the function's
  violation of Rust's pointer safety rules.\n\nThe function downcasted a mutable reference
  to its `struct kvm_create_device` argument to an immutable pointer, and then proceeded
  to pass this pointer to a mutating system call. Rustc 1.82.0 and newer elides subsequent
  reads of this structure's fields, meaning code will not see the value written by
  the kernel into the `fd` member. Instead, the code will observe the value that this
  field was initialized to prior to calling `VmFd::create_device` (usually, 0).\n\nThe
  issue started in kvm-ioctls 0.1.0 and was fixed in 0.19.1 by correctly using\na
  mutable pointer."
