description: "VecCopy::data is created as a Vec of u8 but can be used to store and
  retrieve elements of different types leading to misaligned access.\n\nThe issue
  was resolved in v0.5.0 by replacing data being stored by Vec<u8> with a custom managed
  pointer. Elements are now stored and retrieved using types with proper alignment
  corresponding to original types."
