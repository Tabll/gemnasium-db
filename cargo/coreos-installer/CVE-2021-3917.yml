package_slug: "cargo/coreos-installer"
title: "coreos-installer < 0.10.0 writes world-readable Ignition config to installed
  system"
description: "On systems installed with coreos-installer before 0.10.0, the user-provided
  Ignition config was written to `/boot/ignition/config.ign` with world-readable permissions,
  granting unprivileged users access to any secrets included in the config.\n\nDefault
  configurations of Fedora CoreOS and RHEL CoreOS do not include any unprivileged
  user accounts.  In addition, instances launched from a cloud image, and systems
  provisioned with the `ignition.config.url` kernel argument, do not use the `config.ign`
  file and are unaffected."
