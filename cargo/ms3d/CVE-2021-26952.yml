package_slug: "cargo/ms3d"
title: "Use of Uninitialized Resource in ms3d"
description: "Affected versions of this crate passes an uninitialized buffer to a
  user-provided Read implementation. Arbitrary Read implementations can read from
  the uninitialized buffer (memory exposure) and also can return incorrect number
  of bytes written to the buffer. Reading from uninitialized memory produces undefined
  values that can quickly invoke undefined behavior.\n\nThe flaw was fixed in commit
  `599313b` by zero-initializing the buffer (via self.buf.resize(len, 0)) before passing
  it to Read."
