package_slug: "cargo/rgb"
title: "Out of bounds access in rgb"
description: "Affected versions of rgb crate allow viewing and modifying data of any
  type T wrapped in RGB<T> as bytes, and do not correctly constrain RGB<T> and other
  wrapper structures to the types for which it is safe to do so.\n\nSafety violation
  possible for a type wrapped in RGB<T> and similar wrapper structures:\n\n* If T
  contains padding, viewing it as bytes may lead to exposure of contents of uninitialized
  memory.\n* If T contains a pointer, modifying it as bytes may lead to dereferencing
  of arbitrary pointers.\n* Any safety and/or validity invariants for T may be violated.\n\nThe
  issue was resolved by requiring all types wrapped in structures provided by RGB
  crate to implement an unsafe marker trait."
