description: "Buffered Random Access (BRA) provides easy random memory access to a
  sequential source of data in Rust. This is achieved by greedily retaining all memory
  read from a given source. Buffered Random Access (BRA) provides easy random memory
  access to a sequential source of data in Rust. An issue was discovered in the bra
