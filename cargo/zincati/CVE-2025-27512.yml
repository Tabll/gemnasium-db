package_slug: "cargo/zincati"
title: "Zincati allows unprivileged access to rpm-ostree D-Bus `Deploy()` and `FinalizeDeployment()`
  methods"
description: "Zincati ships a polkit rule which allows the `zincati` system user to
  use the following actions:\n- `org.projectatomic.rpmostree1.deploy`: used to deploy
  updates to the system\n- `org.projectatomic.rpmostree1.finalize-deployment`: used
  to reboot the system into the deployed update\n\nSince Zincati [v0.0.24](https://github.com/coreos/zincati/releases/tag/v0.0.24),
  this polkit rule contains a logic error which broadens access of those polkit actions
  to any unprivileged user rather than just the `zincati` system user.\n\nIn practice,
  this means that any unprivileged user with access to the system D-Bus socket is
  able to deploy older Fedora CoreOS versions (which may have other known vulnerabilities).
  Note that rpm-ostree enforces that the selected version must be from the same branch
  the system is currently on so this cannot directly be used to deploy an attacker-controlled
  update payload.\n\nThis primarily impacts users running untrusted workloads with
  access to the system D-Bus socket. Note that in general, untrusted workloads should
  not be given this access, whether containerized or not. By default, containers do
  not have access to the system D-Bus socket."
