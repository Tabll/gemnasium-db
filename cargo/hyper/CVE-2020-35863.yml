package_slug: "cargo/hyper"
title: "HTTP Request Smuggling in hyper"
description: "Vulnerable versions of hyper allow GET requests to have bodies, even
  if there is no Transfer-Encoding or Content-Length header. As per the HTTP 1.1 specification,
  such requests do not have bodies, so the body will be interpreted as a separate
  HTTP request.\n\nThis allows an attacker who can control the body and method of
  an HTTP request made by hyper to inject a request with headers that would not otherwise
  be allowed, as demonstrated by sending a malformed HTTP request from a Substrate
  runtime. This allows bypassing CORS restrictions. In combination with other vulnerabilities,
  such as an exploitable web server listening on loopback, it may allow remote code
  execution.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in hyper version 0.12.34."
