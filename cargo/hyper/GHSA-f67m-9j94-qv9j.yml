title: "Parser creates invalid uninitialized value"
description: "Affected versions of this crate called `mem::uninitialized()` in the
  HTTP1 parser to create values of type `httparse::Header` (from the `httparse` crate).\nThis
  is unsound, since `Header` contains references and thus must be non-null.\n\nThe
  flaw was corrected by avoiding the use of `mem::uninitialized()`, using `MaybeUninit`
  instead."
