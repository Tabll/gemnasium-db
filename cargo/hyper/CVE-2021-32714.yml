title: "Integer Overflow in Chunked Transfer-Encoding"
description: "hyper's HTTP server and client code had a flaw that could trigger an
  integer overflow when decoding chunk sizes that are too big. This allows possible
  data loss, or if combined with an upstream HTTP proxy that allows chunk sizes larger
  than hyper does, can result in \"request smuggling\" or \"desync attacks\"."
