title: "Lenient Parsing of Content-Length Header When Prefixed with Plus Sign"
description: "hyper's HTTP/1 server code had a flaw that incorrectly parses and accepts
  requests with a `Content-Length` header with a prefixed plus sign, when it should
  have been rejected as illegal. This combined with an upstream HTTP proxy that doesn't
  parse such `Content-Length` headers, but forwards them, can result in \"request
  smuggling\" or \"desync attacks\"."
