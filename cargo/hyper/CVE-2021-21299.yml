title: "HTTP Request Smuggling in hyper"
description: "hyper's HTTP server code had a flaw that incorrectly understands some
  requests with multiple transfer-encoding headers to have a chunked payload, when
  it should have been rejected as illegal. This combined with an upstream HTTP proxy
  that understands the request payload boundary differently can result in \"request
  smuggling\" or \"desync attacks\"."
