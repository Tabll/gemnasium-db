package_slug: "cargo/va-ts"
title: "Data race in va-ts"
description: "In the affected versions of this crate, Demuxer<T> unconditionally implemented
  Send with no trait bounds on T. This allows sending a non-Send type T across thread
  boundaries, which can cause undefined behavior like unlocking a mutex from a thread
  that didn't lock the mutex, or memory corruption from data race. The flaw was corrected
  in commit `0562cbf` by adding a T: Send bound to the Send impl for Demuxer<T>."
