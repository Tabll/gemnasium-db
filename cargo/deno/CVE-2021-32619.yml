title: "Deno's static imports inside dynamically imported modules do not adhere to
  permission checks"
description: "Modules that are dynamically imported through `import()` or `new Worker`
  might have been able to bypass network and file system permission checks when statically
  importing other modules. In Deno 1.5.x and 1.6.x only programs dynamically importing
  (especially transitively) untrusted code are affected. In Deno 1.7.x all programs
  importing (especially transitively) untrusted code are affected.\n\nIn effect an
  attacker in control of a (possibly remote) module in a programs module graph has
  been able to, **irrespective of permissions**:\n1. initiate GET requests to arbitrary
  URLs on the internet (including LAN) and possibly read (parts of) the contents of
  these resources.\n2. check for existence of arbitrary paths on the file system,
  and possibly read (parts of) the contents of these files.\n\nIn Deno 1.5.x (October
  27th, 2020) and Deno 1.6.x (December 8th, 2020) the attacker module had to have
  been granted permissions to load dynamically through the network / fs read permission.
  Since Deno 1.7.x (January 19th, 2021) this vulnerability was able to be exploited
  in a fully sandboxed isolate (without any permissions). This vulnerability was not
  present in releases prior to 1.5.0.\n\nArbitrary non-GET requests, control over
  request headers, or file system writes are not possible through this vulnerability.
  Users of the `deno_core`, `deno_runtime`, or other `deno_*` crates are not affected.
  This is a Deno CLI only vulnerability.\n\nWe are relatively confident this was not
  abused in the wild, as by default Deno prints out a green \"Download\" message when
  remote imports are downloaded, and this would have caused suspicion if it occurred
  in the middle of a programs execution. This message can be silenced with the `--quiet`
  flag."
