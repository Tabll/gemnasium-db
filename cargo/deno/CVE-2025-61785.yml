title: "Deno's --deny-write check does not prevent permission bypass"
description: "`Deno.FsFile.prototype.utime` and `Deno.FsFile.prototype.utimeSync`
  are not limited by the permission model check `--deny-write=./`.\n\nIt's possible
  to change to change the access (`atime`) and modification (`mtime`) times on the
  file stream resource even when the file is opened with `read` only permission (and
  `write`: `false`) and file write operations are not allowed (the script is executed
  with `--deny-write=./`).\n\nSimilar APIs like `Deno.utime` and `Deno.utimeSync`
  require `allow-write` permission, however, when a file is opened, even with read
  only flags and deny-write permission, it's still possible to change the access (`atime`)
  and modification (`mtime`) times, and thus bypass the permission model."
