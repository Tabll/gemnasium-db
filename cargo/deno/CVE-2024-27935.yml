title: "Deno's Node.js Compatibility Runtime has Cross-Session Data Contamination"
description: "A vulnerability in Deno's Node.js compatibility runtime allows for cross-session
  data contamination during simultaneous asynchronous reads from Node.js streams sourced
  from sockets or files. The issue arises from the re-use of a global buffer (BUF)
  in stream_wrap.ts used as a performance optimization to limit allocations during
  these asynchronous read operations. This can lead to data intended for one session
  being received by another session, potentially resulting in data corruption and
  unexpected behavior."
