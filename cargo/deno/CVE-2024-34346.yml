package_slug: "cargo/deno"
title: "Deno permission escalation vulnerability via open of privileged files with
  missing `--deny` flag"
description: "The Deno sandbox may be unexpectedly weakened by allowing file read/write
  access to privileged files in various locations on Unix and Windows platforms. For
  example, reading `/proc/self/environ` may provide access equivalent to `--allow-env`,
  and writing `/proc/self/mem` may provide access equivalent to `--allow-all`.\n\nUsers
  who grant read and write access to the entire filesystem may not realize that these
  access to these files may have additional, unintended consequences. The documentation
  did not reflect that this practice should be undertaken to increase the strength
  of the security sandbox."
