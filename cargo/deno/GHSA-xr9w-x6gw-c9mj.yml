title: "Duplicate advisory: Deno vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service"
description: "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of [GHSA-jc97-h3h9-7xh6](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jc97-h3h9-7xh6).
  This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n## Original Description\nVersions
  of the package deno before 1.31.0 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of
  Service (ReDoS) due to the upgradeWebSocket function, which contains regexes in
  the form of /s*,s*/, used for splitting the Connection/Upgrade header. A specially
  crafted Connection/Upgrade header can be used to significantly slow down a web socket
  server. This issue has been patched in version 1.31.0."
