package_slug: "cargo/deno"
title: "Deno has an incomplete fix for command-injection prevention on Windows — case-insensitive
  extension bypass"
description: "A prior patch aimed to block spawning Windows batch/shell files by returning
  an error when a spawned path’s extension matched `.bat` or `.cmd`. That check performs
  a case-sensitive comparison against lowercase literals and therefore can be bypassed
  when the extension uses alternate casing (for example `.BAT, .Bat`, etc.)."
