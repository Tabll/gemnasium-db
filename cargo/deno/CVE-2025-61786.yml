title: "Deno's --deny-read check does not prevent permission bypass"
description: "`Deno.FsFile.prototype.stat` and `Deno.FsFile.prototype.statSync` are
  not limited by the permission model check `--deny-read=./`.\n\nIt's possible to
  retrieve stats from files that the user do not have explicit read access to  (the
  script is executed with `--deny-read=./`)\n\nSimilar APIs like `Deno.stat` and `Deno.statSync`
  require `allow-read` permission, however, when a file is opened, even with file-write
  only flags and deny-read permission, it's still possible to retrieve file stats,
  and thus bypass the permission model."
