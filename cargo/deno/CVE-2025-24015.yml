title: "Deno's AES GCM authentication tags are not verified"
description: "This affects AES-256-GCM and AES-128-GCM in Deno, introduced by commit
  [0d1beed](https://github.com/denoland/deno/commit/0d1beed). Specifically, the authentication
  tag is not being validated. This means tampered ciphertexts or incorrect keys might
  not be detected, which breaks the guarantees expected from AES-GCM. Older versions
  of Deno correctly threw errors in such cases, as does Node.js.\n\nWithout authentication
  tag verification, AES-GCM degrades to essentially CTR mode, removing integrity protection.
  Authenticated data set with set_aad is also affected, as it is incorporated into
  the GCM hash (ghash) but this too is not validated, rendering AAD checks ineffective."
