title: "fetch: Authorization headers not dropped when redirecting cross-origin"
description: "When you send a request with the `Authorization` header to one domain,
  and the response asks to redirect to a different domain, Deno's`fetch()` redirect
  handling creates a follow-up redirect request that keeps the original `Authorization`
  header, leaking its content to that second domain."
