title: "Marvin Attack: potential key recovery through timing sidechannels"
description: "The [Marvin Attack] is a timing sidechannel vulnerability which allows
  performing RSA decryption and signing operations as an attacker with the ability
  to observe only the time of the decryption operation performed withthe private key.\n\nA
  recent survey of RSA implementations found that the Rust `rsa` crate is one of many
  implementations vulnerable to this attack.\n\nNo fixed version is available at this
  time.\n\n[Marvin Attack]: https://people.redhat.com/~hkario/marvin/"
