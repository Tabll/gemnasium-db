title: "sccache vulnerable to privilege escalation if server is run as root"
description: "On Linux the `sccache` client can execute arbitrary code with the privileges
  of a local `sccache` server, by preloading the code in a shared library passed to
  `LD_PRELOAD`.\n\nIf the server is run as root (which is the default when installing
  the [snap package](https://snapcraft.io/sccache)), this means a user running the
  `sccache` client can get root privileges."
