title: "sequoia-openpgp vulnerable to out-of-bounds array access leading to panic"
description: "Affected versions of the crate have several bugs where attacker-controlled
  input can result in the use of an out-of-bound array index.  Rust detects the use
  of the out-of-bound index and causes the application to panic.  An attacker may
  be able to use this to cause a denial-of-service.  However, it is not possible for
  an attacker to read from or write to the application's address space."
