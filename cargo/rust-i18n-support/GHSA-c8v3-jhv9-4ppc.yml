title: "Use-after-free when setting the locale"
description: "Version 3.0.0 introduced an `AtomicStr` type, that is used to store
  the current locale. It stores the locale as a raw pointer to an `Arc<String>`. The
  locale can be read with `AtomicStr::as_str()`. `AtomicStr::as_str()` does not increment
  the usage counter of the `Arc`.\n\nIf the locale is changed in one thread, another
  thread can have a stale -- possibly already freed -- reference to the stored string."
