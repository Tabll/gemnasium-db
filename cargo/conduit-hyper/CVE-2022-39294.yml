package_slug: "cargo/conduit-hyper"
title: "conduit-hyper vulnerable to Denial of Service from unchecked request length"
description: "Prior to version 0.4.2, `conduit-hyper` did not check any limit on a
  request's length before calling [`hyper::body::to_bytes`](https://docs.rs/hyper/latest/hyper/body/fn.to_bytes.html).
  An attacker could send a malicious request with an abnormally large `Content-Length`,
  which could lead to a panic if memory allocation failed for that request.\n\nIn
  version 0.4.2, `conduit-hyper` sets an internal limit of 128 MiB per request, otherwise
  returning status 400 (\"Bad Request\").\n\nThis crate is part of the implementation
  of Rust's [crates.io](https://crates.io/), but that service is not affected due
  to its existing cloud infrastructure, which already drops such malicious requests.
  Even with the new limit in place, `conduit-hyper` is not recommended for production
  use, nor to directly serve the public Internet.\n\nThe vulnerability was discovered
  by Ori Hollander from the JFrog Security Research team."
