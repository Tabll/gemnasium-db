package_slug: "cargo/sudo-rs"
title: "sudo-rs doesn't record authenticating user properly in timestamp"
description: "When `Defaults targetpw` (or `Defaults rootpw`) is enabled, the password
  of the target account (or root account) instead of the invoking user is used for
  authentication. `sudo-rs` prior to 0.2.10 incorrectly recorded the invoking user’s
  UID instead of the authenticated-as user's UID in the authentication timestamp.
  Any later `sudo` invocation on the same terminal while the timestamp was still valid
  would use that timestamp, potentially bypassing new authentication even if the policy
  would have required it."
