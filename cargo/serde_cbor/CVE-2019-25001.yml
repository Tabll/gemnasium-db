package_slug: "cargo/serde_cbor"
title: "Out of bounds write in serde_cbor"
description: "Affected versions of this crate did not properly check if semantic tags
  were nested excessively during deserialization. This allows an attacker to craft
  small (< 1 kB) CBOR documents that cause a stack overflow. The flaw was corrected
  by limiting the allowed number of nested tags."
