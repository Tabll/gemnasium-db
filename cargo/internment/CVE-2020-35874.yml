package_slug: "cargo/internment"
title: "Use after free in internment"
description: "ArcIntern::drop has a race condition where it can release memory which
  is about to get another user. The new user will get a reference to freed memory.\n\nThis
  was fixed by serializing access to an interned object while it is being deallocated.\n\nVersions
  prior to 0.3.12 used stronger locking which avoided the problem."
