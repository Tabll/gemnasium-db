title: "Deserialization functions pass uninitialized memory to user-provided Read"
description: "Affected versions of this crate passed an uninitialized buffer to a\nuser-provided
  `Read` instance in:\n\n* `deserialize_binary`\n* `deserialize_string`\n* `deserialize_extension_others`\n*
  `deserialize_string_primitive`\n\nThis can result in safe `Read` implementations
  reading from the uninitialized\nbuffer leading to undefined behavior."
