title: "PQClean has a correctness error in HQC decapsulation"
description: "A correctness error has been identified in the reference implementation
  of the HQC key encapsulation mechanism. Due to an indexing error, part of the secret
  key is incorrectly treated as non-secret data. This results in an incorrect shared
  secret value being returned when the decapsulation function is called with a malformed
  ciphertext.\n\nNo concrete attack exploiting the error has been identified at this
  point. However, the error involves mishandling of the secret key, and in principle
  this presents a security vulnerability."
