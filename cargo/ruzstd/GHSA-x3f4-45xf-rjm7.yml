description: "Affected versions of `ruzstd` miscalculate the length of the allocated
  and init section of its internal `RingBuffer`, leading to uninitialized or out-of-bounds
  reads in `copy_bytes_overshooting` of up to 15 bytes.\n\nThis may result in up to
  15 bytes of memory contents being written into the decoded data when decompressing
  a crafted archive. This may occur multiple times per archive."
