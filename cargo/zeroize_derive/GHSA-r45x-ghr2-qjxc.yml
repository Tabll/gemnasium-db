title: "Duplicate Advisory: `#[zeroize(drop)]` doesn't implement `Drop` for `enum`s"
description: "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory is a duplicate of [GHSA-c5hx-w945-j4pq](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c5hx-w945-j4pq).
  This link is preserved to maintain external references.\n\n## Original Description\nAffected
  versions of this crate did not implement `Drop` when `#[zeroize(drop)]` was used
  on an `enum`.\n\nThis can result in memory not being zeroed out after dropping it,
  which is exactly what is intended when adding this attribute.\n\nThe flaw was corrected
  in version 1.2 and `#[zeroize(drop)]` on `enum`s now properly implements `Drop`."
