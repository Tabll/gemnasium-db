package_slug: "cargo/ticketed_lock"
title: "Data races in ticketed_lock"
description: "Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implemented Send for
  ReadTicket<T> & WriteTicket<T>. This allows to send non-Send T to other threads.
  This can allows creating data races by cloning types with internal mutability and
  sending them to other threads (as T of ReadTicket<T>/WriteTicket<T>). Such data
  races can cause memory corruption or other undefined behavior. The flaw was corrected
  in commit `a986a93` by adding T: Send bounds to Send impls of ReadTicket<T>/WriteTicket<T>."
