title: "Data races in ticketed_lock"
description: "Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implemented `Send` for
  `ReadTicket<T>` & `WriteTicket<T>`.\nThis allows to send non-Send `T` to other threads.\n\nThis
  can allows creating data races by cloning types with internal mutability and sending
  them to other threads (as `T` of `ReadTicket<T>`/`WriteTicket<T>`). Such data races
  can cause memory corruption or other undefined behavior.\n\nThe flaw was corrected
  in commit `a986a93` by adding `T: Send` bounds to `Send` impls of `ReadTicket<T>`/`WriteTicket<T>`."
