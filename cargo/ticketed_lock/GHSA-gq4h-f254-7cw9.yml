title: "Duplicate Advisory: Data races in ticketed_lock"
description: "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-77m6-x95j-75r5. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n## Original Description\nAffected versions of this crate unconditionally
  implemented `Send` for `ReadTicket<T>` & `WriteTicket<T>`.\nThis allows to send
  non-Send `T` to other threads.\n\nThis can allows creating data races by cloning
  types with internal mutability and sending them to other threads (as `T` of `ReadTicket<T>`/`WriteTicket<T>`).
  Such data races can cause memory corruption or other undefined behavior.\n\nThe
  flaw was corrected in commit `a986a93` by adding `T: Send` bounds to `Send` impls
  of `ReadTicket<T>`/`WriteTicket<T>`."
