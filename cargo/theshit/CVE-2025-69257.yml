title: "theshit vulnerable to unsafe loading of user-owned Python rules when running
  as root"
description: "**Vulnerability Type:** Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) / Arbitrary
  Code Execution.\n\nThe application loads custom Python rules and configuration files
  from user-writable locations (e.g., `~/.config/theshit/`) without validating ownership
  or permissions when executed with elevated privileges.\n\nIf the tool is invoked
  with `sudo` or otherwise runs with an effective UID of root, it continues to trust
  configuration files originating from the unprivileged user's environment. This allows
  a local attacker to inject arbitrary Python code via a malicious rule or configuration
  file, which is then executed with root privileges.\n\n**Who is impacted:**\nAny
  system where this tool is executed with elevated privileges is affected. In environments
  where the tool is permitted to run via `sudo` without a password (`NOPASSWD`), a
  local unprivileged user can escalate privileges to root without additional interaction."
