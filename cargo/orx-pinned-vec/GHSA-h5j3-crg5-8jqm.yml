title: "orx-pinned-vec has undefined behavior in index_of_ptr with empty slices"
description: "The safe function `index_of_ptr` causes undefined behavior when called
  with an empty slice.\n\nThe issue occurs in the line `ptr.add(slice.len() - 1)`
  which underflows when `slice.len()` is 0, creating a pointer with a massive offset.
  According to Rust's safety rules, creating such a pointer causes immediate undefined
  behavior."
