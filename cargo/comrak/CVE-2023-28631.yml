package_slug: "cargo/comrak"
title: "Comrak AST node data is not validated (GHSL-2023-049)"
description: "A Comrak AST can be constructed manually by a program instead of parsing
  a Markdown document with `parse_document`. This AST can then be converted to HTML
  via `html::format_document_with_plugins`. However, the HTML formatting code assumes
  that the AST is well-formed. For example, many AST notes contain `[u8]` fields which
  the formatting code assumes is valid UTF-8 data. Several bugs can be triggered if
  this is not the case."
