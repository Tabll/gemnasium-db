title: "`OCSP_basic_verify` may incorrectly verify the response signing certificate"
description: "The function `OCSP_basic_verify` verifies the signer certificate on
  an OCSP response. In the case where the (non-default) flag OCSP_NOCHECKS is used
  then the response will be positive (meaning a successful verification) even in the
  case where the response signing certificate fails to verify. It is anticipated that
  most users of `OCSP_basic_verify` will not use the OCSP_NOCHECKS flag. In this case
  the `OCSP_basic_verify` function will return a negative value (indicating a fatal
  error) in the case of a certificate verification failure. The normal expected return
  value in this case would be 0. This issue also impacts the command line OpenSSL
  \"ocsp\" application. When verifying an ocsp response with the \"-no_cert_checks\"
  option the command line application will report that the verification is successful
  even though it has in fact failed. In this case the incorrect successful response
  will also be accompanied by error messages showing the failure and contradicting
  the apparently successful result. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.3 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2)."
