title: "Vulnerable OpenSSL included in cryptography wheels"
description: "pyca/cryptography's wheels include a statically linked copy of OpenSSL.
  The versions of OpenSSL included in cryptography 0.8.1-39.0.0  are vulnerable to
  a security issue. More details about the vulnerabilities themselves can be found
  in https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20221213.txt and https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230207.txt.\n\nIf
  you are building cryptography source (\"sdist\") then you are responsible for upgrading
  your copy of OpenSSL. Only users installing from wheels built by the cryptography
  project (i.e., those distributed on PyPI) need to update their cryptography versions."
