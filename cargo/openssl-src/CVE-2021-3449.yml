package_slug: "cargo/openssl-src"
title: "openssl-src NULL pointer Dereference in signature_algorithms processing"
description: "An OpenSSL TLS server may crash if sent a maliciously crafted renegotiation
  ClientHello message from a client. If a TLSv1.2 renegotiation ClientHello omits
  the signature_algorithms extension (where it was present in the initial ClientHello),
  but includes a signature_algorithms_cert extension then a NULL pointer dereference
  will result, leading to a crash and a denial of service attack. A server is only
  vulnerable if it has TLSv1.2 and renegotiation enabled (which is the default configuration).
  OpenSSL TLS clients are not impacted by this issue. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 versions are
  affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1k.
  OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1k (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1j)."
