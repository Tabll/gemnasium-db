title: "openssl-src heap memory corruption with RSA private key operation"
description: "The OpenSSL 3.0.4 release introduced a serious bug in the RSA implementation
  for X86_64 CPUs supporting the AVX512IFMA instructions. This issue makes the RSA
  implementation with 2048 bit private keys incorrect on such machines and memory
  corruption will happen during the computation. As a consequence of the memory corruption
  an attacker may be able to trigger a remote code execution on the machine performing
  the computation. SSL/TLS servers or other servers using 2048 bit RSA private keys
  running on machines supporting AVX512IFMA instructions of the X86_64 architecture
  are affected by this issue."
