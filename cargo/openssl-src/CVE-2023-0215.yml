title: "openssl-src vulnerable to Use-after-free following `BIO_new_NDEF`"
description: "The public API function `BIO_new_NDEF` is a helper function used for
  streaming ASN.1 data via a `BIO`. It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to
  support the SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called
  directly by end user applications.\n\nThe function receives a `BIO` from the caller,
  prepends a new `BIO_f_asn1` filter `BIO` onto the front of it to form a `BIO` chain,
  and then returns the new head of the `BIO` chain to the caller. Under certain conditions,
  for example if a CMS recipient public key is invalid, the new filter `BIO` is freed
  and the function returns a `NULL` result indicating a failure. However, in this
  case, the `BIO` chain is not properly cleaned up and the `BIO` passed by the caller
  still retains internal pointers to the previously freed filter `BIO`. If the caller
  then goes on to call `BIO_pop()` on the `BIO` then a use-after-free will occur.
  This will most likely result in a crash.\n\nThis scenario occurs directly in the
  internal function `B64_write_ASN1()` which may cause `BIO_new_NDEF()` to be called
  and will subsequently call `BIO_pop()` on the `BIO`. This internal function is in
  turn called by the public API functions `PEM_write_bio_ASN1_stream`, `PEM_write_bio_CMS_stream`,
  `PEM_write_bio_PKCS7_stream`, `SMIME_write_ASN1`, `SMIME_write_CMS` and `SMIME_write_PKCS7`.\n\nOther
  public API functions that may be impacted by this include `i2d_ASN1_bio_stream`,
  `BIO_new_CMS`, `BIO_new_PKCS7`, `i2d_CMS_bio_stream` and `i2d_PKCS7_bio_stream`."
