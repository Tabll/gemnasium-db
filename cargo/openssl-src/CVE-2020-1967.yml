title: "Null pointer deference in openssl-src "
description: "Server or client applications that call the SSL_check_chain() function
  during or after a TLS 1.3 handshake may crash due to a NULL pointer dereference
  as a result of incorrect handling of the \"signature_algorithms_cert\" TLS extension.
  The crash occurs if an invalid or unrecognised signature algorithm is received from
  the peer. This could be exploited by a malicious peer in a Denial of Service attack.
  OpenSSL version 1.1.1d, 1.1.1e, and 1.1.1f are affected by this issue. This issue
  did not affect OpenSSL versions prior to 1.1.1d. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1g (Affected
  1.1.1d-1.1.1f)."
