title: "openssl-src contains Read Buffer Overflow in X.509 Name Constraint"
description: "A read buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification,
  specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs\nafter certificate
  chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious
  certificate or for the application to\ncontinue certificate verification despite
  failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer.\n\nThe read buffer overrun might
  result in a crash which could lead to a denial of service attack. In theory it could
  also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys,
  or sensitive plaintext) although we are not aware of any working exploit leading
  to memory contents disclosure as of the time of release of this advisory.\n\nIn
  a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS
  server, this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a
  malicious client connects."
