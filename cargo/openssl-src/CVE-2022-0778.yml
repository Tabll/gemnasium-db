title: "openssl-src's infinite loop in `BN_mod_sqrt()` reachable when parsing certificates"
description: "The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains
  a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function
  is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed
  form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed
  form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that
  has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to
  verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally
  supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite
  loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit
  elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming
  server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers
  taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing
  certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic
  curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the
  attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the
  OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the
  certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However
  any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the
  infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger
  the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL
  versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2
  on the 15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in
  OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1m). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zc)."
