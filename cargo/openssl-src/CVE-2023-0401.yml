title: "openssl-src contains `NULL` dereference during PKCS7 data verification"
description: "A `NULL` pointer can be dereferenced when signatures are being verified
  on PKCS7 `signed` or `signedAndEnveloped` data. In case the hash algorithm used
  for the signature is known to the OpenSSL library but the implementation of the
  hash algorithm is not available the digest initialization will fail. There is a
  missing check for the return value from the initialization function which later
  leads to invalid usage of the digest API most likely leading to a crash. The unavailability
  of an algorithm can be caused by using FIPS enabled configuration of providers or
  more commonly by not loading the legacy provider.\n\nPKCS7 data is processed by
  the SMIME library calls and also by the time stamp (TS) library calls. The TLS implementation
  in OpenSSL does not call these functions however third party applications would
  be affected if they call these functions to verify signatures on untrusted data."
