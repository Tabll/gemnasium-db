title: "Using a Custom Cipher with `NID_undef` may lead to NULL encryption"
description: "OpenSSL supports creating a custom cipher via the legacy EVP_CIPHER_meth_new()
  function and associated function calls. This function was deprecated in OpenSSL
  3.0 and application authors are instead encouraged to use the new provider mechanism
  in order to implement custom ciphers. OpenSSL versions 3.0.0 to 3.0.5 incorrectly
  handle legacy custom ciphers passed to the EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2()
  and EVP_CipherInit_ex2() functions (as well as other similarly named encryption
  and decryption initialisation functions). Instead of using the custom cipher directly
  it incorrectly tries to fetch an equivalent cipher from the available providers.
  An equivalent cipher is found based on the NID passed to EVP_CIPHER_meth_new().
  This NID is supposed to represent the unique NID for a given cipher. However it
  is possible for an application to incorrectly pass NID_undef as this value in the
  call to EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(). When NID_undef is used in this way the OpenSSL encryption/decryption
  initialisation function will match the NULL cipher as being equivalent and will
  fetch this from the available providers. This will succeed if the default provider
  has been loaded (or if a third party provider has been loaded that offers this cipher).
  Using the NULL cipher means that the plaintext is emitted as the ciphertext. Applications
  are only affected by this issue if they call EVP_CIPHER_meth_new() using NID_undef
  and subsequently use it in a call to an encryption/decryption initialisation function.
  Applications that only use SSL/TLS are not impacted by this issue. Fixed in OpenSSL
  3.0.6 (Affected 3.0.0-3.0.5)."
