title: "Unauthenticated Nonce Increment in snow"
description: "There was a logic bug where unauthenticated payloads could still cause
  a nonce increment in snow's internal state. For an attacker with the ability to
  inject packets into the channel Noise is talking over, this allows a denial-of-service
  type attack which could prevent communication as it causes the sending and receiving
  side to be expecting different nonce values than would arrive.\n\nNote that this
  only affects those who are using the stateful `TransportState`, not those using
  `StatelessTransportState`."
