package_slug: "cargo/magnetic"
title: "Data races in magnetic"
description: "Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implemented Sync and
  Send traits for MPMCConsumer and MPMCProducer types. This allows users to send types
  that do not implement Send trait across thread boundaries, which can cause a data
  race. The flaw was corrected in the 2.0.1 release by adding T: Send bound to affected
  Sync/Send trait implementations."
