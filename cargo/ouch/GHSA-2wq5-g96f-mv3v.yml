title: "Ouch! allows a segmentation fault due to use of uninitialized memory"
description: "When trying to decompress a file using \"ouch\", we can reach the function
  \"ouch::archive::zip::convert_zip_date_time\". In the function, there is a unsafe
  function, \"transmute\". Once the \"transmute\" function is called to convert the
  type of \"month\" object, the address of the object is changed to the uninitialized
  memory region. After that, when other function tries to dereference \"month\", segmentation
  fault occurs."
