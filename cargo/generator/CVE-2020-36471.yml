package_slug: "cargo/generator"
title: "Data races in generator"
description: "The `Generator` type is an iterable which uses a generator function
  that yields\nvalues. In affected versions of the crate, the provided function yielding
  values\nhad no `Send` bounds despite the `Generator` itself implementing `Send`.\n\nThe
  generator function lacking a `Send` bound means that types that are\ndangerous to
  send across threads such as `Rc` could be sent as part of a\ngenerator, potentially
  leading to data races."
