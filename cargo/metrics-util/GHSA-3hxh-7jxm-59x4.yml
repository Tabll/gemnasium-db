title: "AtomicBucket<T> unconditionally implements Send/Sync"
description: "In the affected versions of the crate, `AtomicBucket<T>` unconditionally
  implements `Send`/`Sync` traits. Therefore, users can create a data race to the
  inner\n`T: !Sync` by using the `AtomicBucket::data_with()` API.\nSuch data races
  can potentially cause memory corruption or other undefined behavior.\n\nThe flaw
  was fixed in commit 8e6daab by adding appropriate Send/Sync bounds to the Send/Sync
  impl of struct `Block<T>` (which is a data type contained inside `AtomicBucket<T>`)."
