package_slug: "cargo/reffers"
title: "Data races in reffers"
description: "ARefss<'a, V> is a type that is assumed to contain objects that are
  Send + Sync.\n\nIn the affected versions of this crate, Send/Sync traits are unconditionally
  implemented for ARefss<'a, V>.\n\nBy using the ARefss::map() API, we can insert
  a !Send or !Sync object into ARefss<'a, V>. After that, it is possible to create
  a data race to the inner object of ARefss<'a, V>, which can lead to undefined behavior
  & memory corruption.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in commit `6dd7ca0` by adding trait
  bound V: Send + Sync to ARefss::map() API."
