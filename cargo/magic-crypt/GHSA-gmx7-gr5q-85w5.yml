title: "magic-crypt uses insecure cryptographic algorithms"
description: "This crate uses a number of cryptographic algorithms that are no longer
  considered secure and it uses them in ways that do not guarantee the integrity of
  the encrypted data.\n\n`MagicCrypt64` uses the insecure DES block cipher in CBC
  mode without authentication. This allows for practical brute force and padding oracle
  attacks and does not protect the integrity of the encrypted data. Key and IV are
  generated from user input using CRC64, which is not at all a key derivation function.\n\n`MagicCrypt64`,
  `MagicCrypt128`, `MagicCrypt192`, and `MagicCrypt256` are all vulnerable to padding-oracle
  attacks. None of them protect the integrity of the ciphertext. Furthermore, none
  use password-based key derivation functions, even though the key is intended to
  be generated from a password.\n\nEach of the implementations are unsound in that
  they use uninitialized memory without `MaybeUninit` or equivalent structures.\n\nFor
  more information, visit the [issue](https://github.com/magiclen/rust-magiccrypt/issues/17)."
