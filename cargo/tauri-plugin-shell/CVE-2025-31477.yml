title: "Improper Scope Validation in the `open` Endpoint of `tauri-plugin-shell`"
description: "The Tauri [`shell`](https://tauri.app/plugin/shell/)  plugin exposes
  functionality to execute code and open programs on the system. The [`open`](https://tauri.app/reference/javascript/shell/#open)
  endpoint of this plugin is designed to allow open functionality with the system
  opener (e.g.\n`xdg-open` on Linux). This was meant to be restricted to a reasonable
  number of protocols like `https` or `mailto` by default.\n\nThis default restriction
  was not functional due to improper validation of the allowed protocols, allowing
  for potentially dangerous protocols like `file://`, `smb://`, or `nfs://` and others
  \ to be opened by the system registered protocol handler.\n\nBy passing untrusted
  user input to the `open` endpoint these potentially dangerous protocols can be abused
  to gain remote code execution on the system. This either requires direct exposure
  of the endpoint to application users or code execution in the frontend of a Tauri
  application.\n\nYou are not affected if you have explicitly configured a validation
  regex or manually set the `open` endpoint to `true` in the plugin configuration.\n\nTechnically
  the scope was never a limitation for the rust side as it is not seen as an enforceable
  security boundary but we decided to mark the rust crate as affected since the plugin
  does not need to be a frontend dependency to be exposed."
