package_slug: "cargo/routinator"
title: "Memory exhaustion in routinator"
description: "NLnet Labs Routinator versions 0.9.0 up to and including 0.10.1, support
  the gzip transfer encoding when querying RRDP repositories. This encoding can be
  used by an RRDP repository to cause an out-of-memory crash in these versions of
  Routinator. RRDP uses XML which allows arbitrary amounts of white space in the encoded
  data. The gzip scheme compresses such white space extremely well, leading to very
  small compressed files that become huge when being decompressed for further processing,
  big enough that Routinator runs out of memory when parsing input data waiting for
  the next XML element."
