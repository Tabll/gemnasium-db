title: "NLnet Labs Routinator has Reachable Assertion vulnerability"
description: "In NLnet Labs Routinator 0.9.0 up to and including 0.11.2, due to a
  mistake in error handling, data in RRDP snapshot and delta files which are not correctly
  base 64 encoded are treated as a fatal error and causes Routinator to exit. Worst
  case impact of this vulnerability is denial of service for the RPKI data that Routinator
  provides to routers. This may stop your network from validating route origins based
  on RPKI data. This vulnerability does not allow an attacker to manipulate RPKI data."
