package_slug: "cargo/russh"
title: "russh is missing overflow checks during channel windows adjust"
description: "The channel window adjust message of the SSH protocol is used to track
  the free space in the receive buffer of the other side of a channel. The current
  implementation takes the value from the message and adds it to an internal state
  value. This can result in a integer overflow. If the Rust code is compiled with
  overflow checks, it will panic.  A malicious  client can crash a server."
