package_slug: "cargo/memoffset"
title: "Exposure of uninitialized memory in memoffset"
description: "Affected versions of this crate caused traps and/or memory unsafety
  by zero-initializing references. They also could lead to uninitialized memory being
  dropped if the field for which the offset is requested was behind a deref coercion,
  and that deref coercion caused a panic. The flaw was corrected by using MaybeUninit."
