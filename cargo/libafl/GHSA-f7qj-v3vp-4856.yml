title: "libafl has unsound usages of `core::slice::from_raw_parts_mut` "
description: "The library breaks the safety assumptions when using unsafe API `slice::from_raw_parts_mut`.
  The pointer passed to `from_raw_parts_mut` is misaligned by casting `u8` to `u16`
  raw pointer directly, which is unsound. The bug is patched by using `align_offset`,
  which could make sure the memory address is aligned to 2 bytes for `u16`."
