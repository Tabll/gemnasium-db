package_slug: "cargo/lexer"
title: "Data races in lexer"
description: "lexer is a plugin based lexical reader.Affected versions of this crate
  implements Sync for ReaderResult<T, E> with the trait bound T: Send, E: Send. Since
  matching on the public enum ReaderResult<T, E> provides access to &T & &E, allowing
  data race to a non-Sync type T or E. This can result in a memory corruption when
  multiple threads concurrently access &T or &E. Suggested fix for the bug is change
  the trait bounds imposed on T & E to be T: Sync, E: Sync."
