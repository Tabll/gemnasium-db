title: "Race Condition Enabling Link Following and Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU)
  Race Condition in remove_dir_all"
description: "The `remove_dir_all` crate is a Rust library that offers additional
  features over the Rust standard library `fs::remove_dir_all` function. It suffers
  the same class of failure as the code it was layering over: TOCTOU race conditions,
  with the ability to cause arbitrary paths to be deleted by substituting a symlink
  for a path after the type of the path was checked.\n\nThanks to the Rust security
  team for identifying the problem and alerting us to it."
