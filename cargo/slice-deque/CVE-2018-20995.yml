package_slug: "cargo/slice-deque"
title: "Memory corruption slice-deque"
description: "Affected versions of this crate did not properly update the head and
  tail of the deque when inserting and removing elements from the front if, before
  insertion or removal, the tail of the deque was in the mirrored memory region, and
  if, after insertion or removal, the head of the deque is exactly at the beginning
  of the mirrored memory region.\n\nAn attacker that controls both element insertion
  and removal into the deque could put it in a corrupted state. Once the deque enters
  such an state, its head and tail are corrupted, but in bounds of the allocated memory.
  This can result in partial reads and writes, reads of uninitialized memory, reads
  of memory containing previously dropped objects, etc. An attacker could exploit
  this to alter program execution.\n\nThe flaw was corrected by properly updating
  the head and tail of the deque in this case."
