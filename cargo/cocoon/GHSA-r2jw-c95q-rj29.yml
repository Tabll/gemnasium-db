title: "Duplicate Advisory: cocoon Reuses a Nonce, Key Pair in Encryption"
description: "### Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it
  is a duplicate of GHSA-6878-6wc2-pf5h. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n### Original Description\nVersions of the package cocoon before 0.4.0
  are vulnerable to Reusing a Nonce, Key Pair in Encryption when the encrypt, wrap,
  and dump functions are sequentially called. An attacker can generate the same ciphertext
  by creating a new encrypted message with the same cocoon object.\n\n**Note:**\nThe
  issue does NOT affect objects created with Cocoon::new which utilizes ThreadRng."
