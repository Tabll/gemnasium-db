title: "Sequential calls of encryption API (`encrypt`, `wrap`, and `dump`) result
  in nonce reuse"
description: "**Problem**: Trying to create a new encrypted message with the same
  cocoon object generates the same ciphertext. It mostly affects `MiniCocoon` and
  `Cocoon` objects with custom seeds and RNGs (where `StdRng` is used under the hood).\n\n**Note**:
  The issue does **NOT** affect objects created with **`Cocoon::new`** which utilizes
  `ThreadRng`.\n\n**Cause**: `StdRng` produces the same nonce because `StdRng::clone`
  resets its state.\n\n**Measure**: Make encryption API mutable (`encrypt`, `wrap`,
  and `dump`).\n\n**Workaround**: Create a new cocoon object with a new **seed** per
  each encryption."
