title: "Weight not properly refunded after EVM execution"
description: "Previously, the worst case weight was always accounted as the block
  weight for all cases. In case of large EVM gas refunds, this can lead to block spamming
  attacks -- the adversary can construct blocks with transactions that have large
  amount of refunds or unused gases with reverts, and as a result inflate up the chain
  gas prices. This issue is fixed by properly refund unused weights after each EVM
  execution.\n\nThe impact of this issue is limited in that the spamming attack would
  still be costly for any adversary, and it has no ability to alter any chain state."
