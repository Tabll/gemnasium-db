title: "Integer underflow in Frontier"
description: "A bug in Frontier's MODEXP precompile implementation can cause an integer
  underflow in certain conditions. This will cause a node crash for debug builds.
  For release builds (and production WebAssembly binaries), the impact is limited
  as it can only cause a normal EVM out-of-gas. It is recommended that you apply the
  patch as soon as possible.\n\nIf you do not use MODEXP precompile in your runtime,
  then you are not impacted."
