title: "`pnet_packet` buffer overrun in `set_payload` setters"
description: "As indicated by this [issue](https://github.com/libpnet/libpnet/issues/449#issuecomment-663355987),
  a buffer overrun is possible in the `set_payload` setter of the various mutable
  \"Packet\" struct setters. The offending `set_payload` functions were defined within
  the struct `impl` blocks in earlier versions of the package, and later by the `packet`
  macro.\n\nFixed in the `packet` macro by [this](https://github.com/libpnet/libpnet/pull/455)
  PR."
