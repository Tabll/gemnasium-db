title: "Svix vulnerable to improper comparison of different-length signatures"
description: "The `Webhook::verify` function incorrectly compared signatures of different
  lengths - the two signatures would only be compared up to the length of the shorter
  signature. This allowed an attacker to pass in `v1,` as the signature, which would
  always pass verification."
