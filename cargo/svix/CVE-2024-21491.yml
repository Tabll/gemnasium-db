package_slug: "cargo/svix"
title: "svix vulnerable to Authentication Bypass"
description: "Versions of the package svix before 1.17.0 are vulnerable to Authentication
  Bypass due to an issue in the verify function where signatures of different lengths
  are incorrectly compared. An attacker can bypass signature verification by providing
  a shorter signature that matches the beginning of the actual signature.\n\n**Note:**\n\nThe
  attacker would need to know a victim uses the Rust library for verification,no easy
  way to automatically check that; and uses webhooks by a service that uses Svix,
  and then figure out a way to craft a malicious payload that will actually include
  all of the correct identifiers needed to trick the receivers to cause actual issues."
