title: "RISC Zero zkVM notes on zero-knowledge"
description: "RISC Zero zkVM was designed from its inception to provide three main
  guarantees:\n1. *Computational integrity*: that a given software program executed
  correctly.\n2. *Succinctness*: that the proof of execution does not grow in relation
  to the program being executed.\n3. *Zero Knowledge*: that details of the program
  execution are not visible within the proof of program execution.\n\nUlrich Habock
  and Al Kindi have released [new research] that indicates that several STARK implementations
  -including our RISC Zero zkVM- do not meet the requirements to assert the specific
  property of zero knowledge provably.\n\nWhile a vast majority of real-world applications
  that leverage RISC Zero zkVM or similar systems depend primarily on computational
  integrity and succinctness, a subset of applications critically depend on the privacy
  guarantees provided by zero-knowledge; and for those use cases, users are cautioned
  to understand the research and make informed decisions based on the risks outlined
  in using an impacted system.\n\nAlthough the maintainers are not aware of any attacks
  that can take advantage of this potential weakness, they are working to proactively
  address this discovery as quickly as possible.\n\n[new research]: https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1037"
