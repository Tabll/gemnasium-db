title: "Triton VM Soundness Vulnerability due to Improper Sampling of Randomness"
description: "In affected versions of Triton VM, the verifier failed to correctly
  sample randomness in the FRI sub-protocol.\n\nMalicious provers can exploit this
  to craft proofs for arbitrary statements that this verifier accepts as valid, undermining
  soundness.\n\nProtocols that rely on proofs and the supplied verifier of the affected
  versions of Triton VM are completely broken. Protocols implementing their own verifier
  might be unaffected.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in commit 3a045d63, where the relevant
  randomness is sampled correctly."
