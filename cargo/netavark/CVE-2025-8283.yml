title: "Netavark Has Possible DNS Resolve Confusion "
description: "A vulnerability was found in the netavark package, a network stack for
  containers used with Podman. Due to dns.podman search domain being removed, netavark
  may return external servers if a valid A/AAAA record is sent as a response. When
  creating a container with a given name, this name will be used as the hostname for
  the container itself, as the podman's search domain is not added anymore the container
  is using the host's resolv.conf, and the DNS resolver will try to look into the
  search domains contained on it. If one of the domains contain a name with the same
  hostname as the running container, the connection will forward to unexpected external
  servers."
