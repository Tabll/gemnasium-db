package_slug: "cargo/image"
title: "Mutable reference with immutable provenance in image"
description: "A mutable reference to a struct was constructed by dereferencing a pointer
  obtained from slice::as_ptr. Instead, slice::as_mut_ptr should have been called
  on the mutable slice argument. The former performs an implicit reborrow as an immutable
  shared reference which does not allow writing through the derived pointer."
