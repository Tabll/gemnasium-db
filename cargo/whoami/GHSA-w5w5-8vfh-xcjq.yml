title: "whoami stack buffer overflow on several Unix platforms"
description: "With versions of the whoami crate >= 0.5.3 and < 1.5.0, calling any
  of these functions leads to an immediate stack buffer overflow on illumos and Solaris:\n\n-
  `whoami::username`\n- `whoami::realname`\n- `whoami::username_os`\n- `whoami::realname_os`\n\nWith
  versions of the whoami crate >= 0.5.3 and < 1.0.1, calling any of the above functions
  also leads to a stack buffer overflow on these platforms:\n\n- Bitrig\n- DragonFlyBSD\n-
  FreeBSD\n- NetBSD\n- OpenBSD\n\nThis occurs because of an incorrect definition of
  the `passwd` struct on those platforms.\n\nAs a result of this issue, denial of
  service and data corruption have both been observed in the wild. The issue is possibly
  exploitable as well.\n\nThis vulnerability also affects other Unix platforms that
  aren't Linux or macOS.\n\nThis issue has been addressed in whoami 1.5.0.\n\nFor
  more information, see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/ardaku/whoami/issues/91)."
