package_slug: "cargo/gix-path"
title: "gix-path uses local config across repos when it is the highest scope"
description: "`gix-path` executes `git` to find the path of a configuration file that
  belongs to the `git` installation itself, but mistakenly treats the local repository's
  configuration as system-wide if no higher scoped configuration is found. In rare
  cases, this causes a less trusted repository to be treated as more trusted, or leaks
  sensitive information from one repository to another, such as sending credentials
  to another repository's remote."
