title: "`temporary` makes use of uninitialized memory"
description: "Uninitialized memory is used as a RNG seed in temporary. This has been
  resolved in the 0.6.4 release. The crate is not intended to be used outside of a
  testing environment. For a general purpose crate to create temporary directories,
  [`tempfile`](https://crates.io/crates/tempfile) is an alternative for this crate."
