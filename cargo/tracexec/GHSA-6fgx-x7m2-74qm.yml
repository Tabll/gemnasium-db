title: "tracexec has `env` command argument injection via environment variables starting
  with dash in traced exec events"
description: "For tracexec's command line reconstruction feature, when a traced process
  executes another process with a environment variable where the key starts with a
  dash, tracexec incorrectly shows its commandline where such environment variables
  could cause argument injection for the `env` command.\nSuch an injection is completely
  at the UI level unless the user tries to copy the command line with the injection
  and paste it into a terminal to execute it.\n\nA minimal POC is executing `env --
  -a=b bash --norc` in tracexec's TUI mode. The resulting command line of `env` executing
  bash would be `env -a bash -a=b  _=/usr/bin/env /usr/bin/bash --norc` in tracexec's
  TUI, which injects `-a=b` into `env`'s arguments.\n\nThis has very limited effect
  for security.  A local adversarial could leverage this to make tracexec show an
  inaccurate reconstructed commandline for their executed command. If the user of
  tracexec decides to copy and run the reconstructed commandline,\nthere could be
  injection for `env`'s `--block-signal`, `--default-signal`, `--ignore-signal`, `--split-string`,
  `--unset`, `--chdir`, `--argv0` arguments."
