- "GHSA-xqqc-c5gw-c5r5"
package_slug: "cargo/tendermint-light-client-verifier"
title: "Tendermint light client verification not taking into account chain ID"
description: "Anyone using the `tendermint-light-client` and related packages to perform
  light client verification (e.g. IBC-rs, Hermes).\n\nAt present, the light client
  does not check that the chain IDs of the trusted and untrusted headers match, resulting
  in a possible attack vector where someone who finds a header from an untrusted chain
  that satisfies all other verification conditions (e.g. enough overlapping validator
  signatures) could fool a light client.\n\nThe attack vector is currently theoretical,
  and no proof-of-concept exists yet to exploit it on live networks."
