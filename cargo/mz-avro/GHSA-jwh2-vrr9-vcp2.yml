title: "mz-avro's incorrect use of `set_len` allows for un-initialized memory"
description: "Affected versions of this crate passes an uninitialized buffer to a
  user-provided `Read`\nimplementation.\n\nArbitrary `Read` implementations can read
  from the uninitialized buffer (memory exposure)\nand also can return incorrect number
  of bytes written to the buffer.\nReading from uninitialized memory produces undefined
  values that can quickly invoke\nundefined behavior.\n\nNote: there is only UB in
  the case where a user provides a struct whose `Read`\nimplementation inspects the
  buffer passed to `read_exact` before writing to it.\nThis is an unidiomatic (albeit
  possible) `Read` implementation.\n\nSee https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/issues/8669
  for details."
