title: "A malicious coder can get unsound access to TCell or TLCell memory"
description: "This is impossible to do by accident, but by carefully constructing\nmarker
  types to be covariant, a malicious coder can cheat the\nsingleton check in `TCellOwner`
  and `TLCellOwner`, giving unsound\naccess to cell memory.  This could take the form
  of getting two\nmutable references to the same memory, or a mutable reference and
  an\nimmutable reference.\n\nThe fix is for the crate to internally force the marker
  type to be\ninvariant.  This blocks the conversion between covariant types which\nRust
  normally allows."
