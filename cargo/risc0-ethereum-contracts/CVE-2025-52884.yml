title: "RISC Zero Ethereum invalid commitment with digest value of zero accepted by
  Steel.validateCommitment"
description: "Prior to 2.1.1 and 2.2.0, the `Steel.validateCommitment` Solidity library
  function will return `true` for a crafted commitment with a digest value of zero.\n\nThis
  violates the semantics of `validateCommitment`, as this does not commitment to a
  block that is in the current chain. Because the digest is zero, it does not correspond
  to any block and there exist no known openings. As a result, this commitment will
  never be produced by a correct zkVM guest using Steel. Leveraging this bug to compromise
  the soundness of an application using Steel would require a separate bug or misuse
  of the Steel library, which is expected to be used to validate the root of state
  opening proofs (e.g. having the guest commit to a digest of zero, or failing to
  check the zkVM proof).\n\nBecause this bug does not risk application integrity,
  correctly written applications are not at risk."
