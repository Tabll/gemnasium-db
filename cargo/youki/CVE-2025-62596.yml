package_slug: "cargo/youki"
title: "youki container escape and denial of service due to arbitrary write gadgets
  and procfs write redirects"
description: "### Impact ###\n\nyouki’s apparmor handling performs insufficiently
  strict write-target validation, which—combined with path substitution during pathname
  resolution—can allow writes to unintended procfs locations.\n\n**Weak write-target
  check**\nyouki only verifies that the destination lies somewhere under procfs. As
  a result, a write intended for `/proc/self/attr/apparmor/exec` can succeed even
  if the path has been redirected to `/proc/sys/kernel/hostname`(which is also in
  procfs).\n\n**Path substitution**\nWhile resolving a path component-by-component,
  a shared-mount race can substitute intermediate components and redirect the final
  target.\n\nThis is a different project, but the core logic is similar to the CVE
  in runc. Issues were identified in runc, and verification was also conducted in
  youki to confirm the problems.\nhttps://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-cgrx-mc8f-2prm\n\n###
  Credits ###\n\nThanks to Li Fubang (@lifubang from acmcoder.com, CIIC) and Tõnis
  Tiigi (@tonistiigi from Docker) for both independently discovering runc's original
  vulnerability, as well as Aleksa Sarai (@cyphar from SUSE) for the original research
  into this class of security issues and solutions."
