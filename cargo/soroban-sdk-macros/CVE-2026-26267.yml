title: "The rs-soroban-sdk #[contractimpl] macro calls inherent function instead of
  trait function when names collide"
description: "The `#[contractimpl]` macro contains a bug in how it wires up function
  calls.\n\nIn Rust, you can define functions on a type in two ways:\n- Directly on
  the type as an inherent function:\n```rust\nimpl MyContract {\nfn value() { ...
  }\n}\n```\n- Through a trait\n```rust\nimpl Trait for MyContract {\nfn value() {
  ... }\n}\n```\n\nThese are two separate functions that happen to share the same
  name. Rust has rules for which one gets called. When you write `MyContract::value()`,
  Rust always picks the one defined directly on the type, not the trait version.\n\nThe
  bug is that `#[contractimpl]` generates code that uses `MyContract::value()` style
  calls even when it's processing the trait version. This means if an inherent function
  is also defined with the same name, the inherent function gets called instead of
  the trait function.\n\nThis means the Wasm-exported entry point silently calls the
  wrong function when two conditions are met simultaneously:\n1. A `impl Trait for
  MyContract` block is defined with one or more functions, with `#[contractimpl]`
  applied.\n2. A `impl MyContract` block is defined with one or more identically named
  functions, without `#[contractimpl]` applied.\n\nIf the trait version contains important
  security checks, such as verifying the caller is authorized, that the inherent version
  does not, those checks are bypassed. Anyone interacting with the contract through
  its public interface will call the wrong function.\n\nFor example:\n\n```rust"
