title: "Delegate functions are missing `Send` bound"
description: "Affected versions of this crate did not require event handlers to have
  `Send` bound despite there being no guarantee of them being called on any particular
  thread, which can potentially lead to data races and undefined behavior.\n\nThe
  flaw was corrected in commit [afe3252](https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs/commit/afe32525c22209aa8f632a0f4ad607863b51796a)
  by adding `Send` bounds."
