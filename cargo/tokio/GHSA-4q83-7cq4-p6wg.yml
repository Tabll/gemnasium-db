title: "`tokio::io::ReadHalf<T>::unsplit` is Unsound"
description: "`tokio::io::ReadHalf<T>::unsplit` can violate the `Pin` contract\n\nThe
  soundness issue is described in the [tokio/issues#5372](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/issues/5372)\n\nSpecific
  set of conditions needed to trigger an issue (a !Unpin type in ReadHalf)\nis unusual,
  combined with the difficulty of making any arbitrary use-after-free\nexploitable
  in Rust without doing a lot of careful alignment of data types in\nthe surrounding
  code.\n\nThe `tokio` feature `io-util` is also required to be enabled to trigger
  this\nsoundness issue.\n\nThanks to zachs18 reporting the issue to Tokio team responsibly
  and taiki-e\nand carllerche appropriately responding and fixing the soundness bug.\n\nTokio
  before 0.2.0 used `futures` 0.1 that did not have `Pin`, so it is not\naffected
  by this issue."
