title: "Tokio broadcast channel calls clone in parallel, but does not require `Sync`"
description: "The broadcast channel internally calls `clone` on the stored value when
  receiving it, and only requires `T:Send`. This means that using the broadcast channel
  with values that are `Send` but not `Sync` can trigger unsoundness if the `clone`
  implementation makes use of the value being `!Sync`.\n\nThank you to Austin Bonander
  for finding and reporting this issue."
