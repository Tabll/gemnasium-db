title: "Tokio reject_remote_clients configuration may get dropped when creating a
  Windows named pipe"
description: "When configuring a Windows named pipe server, setting `pipe_mode` will
  reset `reject_remote_clients` to `false`. If the application has previously configured
  `reject_remote_clients` to `true`, this effectively undoes the configuration. This
  also applies if `reject_remote_clients` is not explicitly set as this is the default
  configuration and is cleared by calling `pipe_mode`.\n\nRemote clients may only
  access the named pipe if the named pipe's associated path is accessible via a publically
  shared folder (SMB)."
