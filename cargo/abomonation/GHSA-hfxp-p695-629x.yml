title: "abomonation transmutes &T to and from &[u8] without sufficient constraints"
description: "This transmute is at the core of the abomonation crates. It's so easy
  to use it to violate alignment requirements that no test in the crate's test suite
  passes under miri.\n\nThe use of this transmute in serialization/deserialization
  also incorrectly assumes that the layout of a repr(Rust) type is stable.\nThis transmute
  can also disclose both the contents of padding bytes which may be an information
  leak and the contents of pointers, which may be used to defeat ASLR."
