package_slug: "cargo/stack_dst"
title: "Drop of uninitialized memory in stack_dst"
description: "Affected versions of stack_dst used a push_inner function that increased
  the internal length of the array and then called val.clone(). If the val.clone()
  call panics, the stack could drop an already dropped element or drop uninitialized
  memory. This issue was fixed in `2a4d538` by increasing the length of the array
  after elements are cloned."
