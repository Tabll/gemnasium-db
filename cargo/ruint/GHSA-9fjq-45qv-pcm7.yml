title: "ruint affected by unsoundness of safe `reciprocal_mg10`"
description: "The function `reciprocal_mg10` is marked as safe but can trigger undefined
  behavior (out-of-bounds access) because it relies on `debug_assert!` for safety
  checks instead of `assert!`.\n\nWhen compiled in release mode, the `debug_assert!`
  is optimized out, potentially allowing invalid inputs to cause memory corruption."
