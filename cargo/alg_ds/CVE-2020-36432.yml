title: "Use of Uninitialized Resource in alg_ds"
description: "An issue was discovered in the alg_ds crate through 2020-08-25 for Rust.
  `Matrix::new()` internally calls `Matrix::fill_with()` which uses `*ptr = value`
  pattern to initialize the buffer. This pattern assumes that there is an initialized
  struct at the address and drops it, which results in dropping of uninitialized struct."
