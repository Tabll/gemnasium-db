- "GHSA-xwfj-jgwm-7wp5"
package_slug: "cargo/tracing-subscriber"
title: " Tracing logging user input may result in poisoning logs with ANSI escape
  sequences"
description: "Previous versions of tracing-subscriber were vulnerable to ANSI escape
  sequence injection attacks. Untrusted user input containing ANSI escape sequences
  could be injected into terminal output when logged, potentially allowing attackers
  to:\n\n- Manipulate terminal title bars\n- Clear screens or modify terminal display\n-
  Potentially mislead users through terminal manipulation\n\nIn isolation, impact
  is minimal, however security issues have been found in terminal emulators that enabled
  an attacker to use ANSI escape sequences via logs to exploit vulnerabilities in
  the terminal emulator."
