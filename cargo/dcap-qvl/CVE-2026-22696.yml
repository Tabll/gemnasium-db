package_slug: "cargo/dcap-qvl"
title: "dcap-qvl has Missing Verification for QE Identity"
description: "This vulnerability involves a critical gap in the cryptographic verification
  process within the dcap-qvl.\n\nThe library fetches QE Identity collateral (including
  qe_identity, qe_identity_signature, and qe_identity_issuer_chain) from the PCCS.
  However, it skips to verify the QE Identity signature against its certificate chain
  and does not enforce policy constraints on the QE Report."
