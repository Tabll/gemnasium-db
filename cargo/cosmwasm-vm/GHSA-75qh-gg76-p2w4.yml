title: "CWA-2023-004: Excessive number of function parameters in compiled Wasm"
description: "A specifically crafted Wasm file can cause the VM to consume excessive
  amounts of memory when compiling a contract.\nThis can lead to high memory usage,
  slowdowns, potentially a crash and can poison a lock in the VM,\npreventing any
  further interaction with contracts.\n\nFor more information, see [CWA-2023-004](https://github.com/CosmWasm/advisories/blob/main/CWAs/CWA-2023-004.md)."
