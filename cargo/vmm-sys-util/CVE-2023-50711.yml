title: "`serde` deserialization for `FamStructWrapper` lacks bound checks that could
  potentially lead to out-of-bounds memory access"
description: "An issue was discovered in the FamStructWrapper::deserialize implementation
  provided by the crate for vmm_sys_util::fam::FamStructWrapper, which can lead to
  out of bounds memory accesses. The deserialization does not check that the length
  stored in the header matches the flexible array length. Mismatch in the lengths
  might allow out of bounds memory access through Rust-safe methods.\n\nImpacted versions:
  >= 0.5.0"
