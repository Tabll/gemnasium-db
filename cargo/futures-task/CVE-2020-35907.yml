title: "futures_task::noop_waker_ref can segfault due to dereferencing a NULL pointer"
description: "Affected versions of the crate used a UnsafeCell in thread-local storage
  to return a noop waker reference, assuming that the reference would never be returned
  from another thread.\n\nThis resulted in a segmentation fault crash if Waker::wake_by_ref()
  was called on a waker returned from another thread due to it attempting to dereference
  a pointer that wasn't accessible from the main thread."
