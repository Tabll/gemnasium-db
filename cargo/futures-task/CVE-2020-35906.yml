package_slug: "cargo/futures-task"
title: "futures_task::waker may cause a use-after-free if used on a type that isn't
  'static"
description: "Affected versions of the crate did not properly implement a 'static
  lifetime bound on the waker function. This resulted in a use-after-free if Waker::wake()
  is called after original data had been dropped.\n\nThe flaw was corrected by adding
  'static lifetime bound to the data waker takes."
