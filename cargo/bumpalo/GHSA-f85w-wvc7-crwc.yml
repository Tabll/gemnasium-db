title: "bumpalo has use-after-free due to a lifetime error in `Vec::into_iter()`"
description: "In affected versions of this crate, the lifetime of the iterator produced
  by `Vec::into_iter()` is not constrained to the lifetime of the `Bump` that allocated
  the vector's memory. Using the iterator after the `Bump` is dropped causes use-after-free
  accesses.\n\nThe following example demonstrates memory corruption arising from a
  misuse of this unsoundness.\n\n```rust\nuse bumpalo::{collections::Vec, Bump};\n\nfn
  main() {\nlet bump = Bump::new();\nlet mut vec = Vec::new_in(&bump);\nvec.extend([0x01u8;
  32]);\nlet into_iter = vec.into_iter();\ndrop(bump);\n\nfor _ in 0..100 {\nlet reuse_bump
  = Bump::new();\nlet _reuse_alloc = reuse_bump.alloc([0x41u8; 10]);\n}\n\nfor x in
  into_iter {\nprint!(\"0x{:02x} \", x);\n}\nprintln!();\n}\n```\n\nThe issue was
  corrected in version 3.11.1 by adding a lifetime to the `IntoIter` type, and updating
  the signature of `Vec::into_iter()` to constrain this lifetime."
