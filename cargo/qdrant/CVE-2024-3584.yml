title: "qdrant is vulnerable to path traversal due to improper input validation in
  the `/collections/{name}/snapshots/upload` endpoint"
description: "qdrant/qdrant version 1.9.0-dev is vulnerable to path traversal due
  to improper input validation in the `/collections/{name}/snapshots/upload` endpoint.
  By manipulating the `name` parameter through URL encoding, an attacker can upload
  a file to an arbitrary location on the system, such as `/root/poc.txt`. This vulnerability
  allows for the writing and overwriting of arbitrary files on the server, potentially
  leading to a full takeover of the system. The issue is fixed in version 1.9.0."
