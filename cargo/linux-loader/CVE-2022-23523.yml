title: "linux-loader reading beyond EOF could lead to infinite loop"
description: "The linux-loader crate used the offsets and sizes provided in the ELF
  headers to determine the offsets to read from. If those offsets pointed beyond the
  end of the file this could lead to an infinite loop. Virtual Machine Monitors using
  the `linux-loader` crate could enter an infinite loop if the ELF header of the kernel
  they are loading was modified in a malicious manner."
