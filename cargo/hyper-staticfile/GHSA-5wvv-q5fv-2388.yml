title: "hyper-staticfile's location header incorporates user input, allowing open
  redirect"
description: "When `hyper-staticfile` performs a redirect for a directory request
  (e.g. a request for `/dir` that redirects to `/dir/`), the `Location` header value
  was derived from user input (the request path), simply appending a slash. The intent
  was to perform an origin-relative redirect, but specific inputs allowed performing
  a scheme-relative redirect instead.\n\nAn attacker could craft a special URL that
  would appear to be for the correct domain, but immediately redirects to a malicious
  domain. Such a URL can benefit phishing attacks, for example an innocent looking
  link in an email."
