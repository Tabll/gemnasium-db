title: "hyper-staticfile's improper validation of Windows paths could lead to directory
  traversal attack"
description: "Path resolution in `hyper-staticfile` didn't correctly validate Windows
  paths, meaning paths like `/foo/bar/c:/windows/web/screen/img101.png` would be allowed
  and respond with the contents of `c:/windows/web/screen/img101.png`. Thus users
  could potentially read files anywhere on the filesystem.\n\nThis only impacts Windows.
  Linux and other unix likes are not impacted by this."
