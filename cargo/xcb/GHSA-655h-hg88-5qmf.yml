title: "Rust XCB `xcb::Connection::connect_to_fd*` functions violate I/O safety"
description: "The API of `xcb::Connection` has constructors which allow an arbitrary
  `RawFd` to be used as a socket connection. On either failure of these constructors
  or on the drop of `Connection`, it closes the associated file descriptor. Thus,
  a program which uses an `OwnedFd` (such as a `UnixStream`) as the file descriptor
  can close the file descriptor and continue to attempt using it or close an already-closed
  file descriptor, violating I/O safety.\n\nStarting in version 1.6.0, `xcb` provides
  `Connection::connect_with_fd` and `Connection::connect_with_fd_and_extensions` as
  safe alternatives and deprecates the problematic functions."
