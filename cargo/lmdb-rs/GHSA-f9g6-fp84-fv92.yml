title: "impl `FromMdbValue` for bool is unsound"
description: "The implementation of `FromMdbValue` has several unsoundness issues.
  First of all, it allows to reinterpret arbitrary bytes as a bool and could make
  undefined behavior happen with safe function. Secondly, it allows transmuting pointer
  without taking memory layout into consideration. The details of reproducing the
  bug are available [here](https://github.com/vhbit/lmdb-rs/issues/67)."
