title: "Invalid use of `mem::uninitialized` causes `use-of-uninitialized-value`"
description: "The compression and decompression function used `mem:uninitialized`
  to create an array of uninitialized values, to later write values into it. This
  later leads to reads from uninitialized memory.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in commit
  b633bf265e41c60dfce3be7eac4e4dd5e18d06cf by using a heap-allocated `Vec` and removing
  out use of `mem::uninitialized`. The fix was released in v0.3.2 and v1.0.0\n\nSubsequently,
  the crate was deprecated and its use is discouraged."
