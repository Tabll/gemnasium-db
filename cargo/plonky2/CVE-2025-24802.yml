title: "Soundness issue with Plonky2 look up tables"
description: "Lookup tables, whose length is not divisible by `26 = floor(num_routed_wires
  / 3)` always include the `0 -> 0` input-output pair. Thus a malicious prover can
  always prove that `f(0) = 0` for any lookup table f (unless its length happens to
  be divisible by 26).\n\nThe cause of problem is that the `LookupTableGate`-s are
  [padded with zeros](https://github.com/0xPolygonZero/plonky2/blob/main/plonky2/src/plonk/prover.rs#L97).\n\nThe
  fix is done by padding with an existing table pair, similarly to `LookupGate`.\n\nA
  workaround from the user side is to extend the table (by repeating some entries)
  so that its length becomes divisible by 26.\n\nFortunately, the seemingly most common
  use case, namely, hash functions with table-based sbox-es, are not vulnerable:\n\n*
  both Monolith's and Tip5/Tip4's s-box tables already map 0 to 0;\n* more generally,
  forcing several (0,0) pairs inside such a hash function appears to be a too strong
  restriction to find an otherwise valid trace.\n\nA malicious prover exploiting this
  could cheat a circuit which statement is the following:\n- output `x + f(x)` for
  some private input `x`, where `f(x) := 100 - x` is implemented by a lookup table.\n\nA
  malicious prover would be able to convince an honest verifier that they know an
  `0 <= x < 64` such that `x + (100 - x) = 0`."
