title: "TunnelVision - decloaking VPNs using DHCP"
description: "A new decloaking technique for nearly all VPN implementations has been
  found, which allows attackers to inject entries into the routing tables of unsuspecting
  victims using DHCP option 121. This allows attackers to redirect traffic, which
  is supposed to be sent encrypted over the VPN, through the physical interface handling
  DHCP for the network the victim's computer is connected to, effectively bypassing
  the VPN connection."
