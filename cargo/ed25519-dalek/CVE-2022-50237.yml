title: "`ed25519-dalek` Double Public Key Signing Function Oracle Attack"
description: "Versions of `ed25519-dalek` prior to v2.0 model private and public keys
  as separate types which can be assembled into a `Keypair`, and also provide APIs
  for serializing and deserializing 64-byte private/public keypairs.\n\nSuch APIs
  and serializations are inherently unsafe as the public key is one of the inputs
  used in the deterministic computation of the `S` part of the signature, but not
  in the `R` value. An adversary could somehow use the signing function as an oracle
  that allows arbitrary public keys as input can obtain two signatures for the same
  message sharing the same `R` and only differ on the `S` part.\n\nUnfortunately,
  when this happens, one can easily extract the private key.\n\nRevised public APIs
  in v2.0 of `ed25519-dalek` do NOT allow a decoupled private/public keypair as signing
  input, except as part of specially labeled \"hazmat\" APIs which are clearly labeled
  as being dangerous if misused."
