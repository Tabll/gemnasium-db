title: "gix-transport indirect code execution via malicious username"
description: "`gix-transport` does not check the username part of a URL for text that
  the external `ssh` program would interpret as an option. A specially crafted clone
  URL can smuggle options to SSH. The possibilities are syntactically limited, but
  if a malicious clone URL is used by an application whose current working directory
  contains a malicious file, arbitrary code execution occurs."
