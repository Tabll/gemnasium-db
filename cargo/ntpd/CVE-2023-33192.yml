package_slug: "cargo/ntpd"
title: "Improper handling of NTS cookie length that could crash the ntpd-rs server"
description: "ntpd-rs does not validate the length of NTS cookies in received NTP
  packets to the server. An attacker can crash the server by sending a specially crafted
  NTP packet containing a cookie shorter than what the server expects. The server
  also crashes when it is not configured to handle NTS packets.\n\nntpd-rs running
  purely as an ntp client is not affected."
