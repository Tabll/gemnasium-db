title: "ntpd NTS client denial of service via wrongly sized cookies"
description: "Two denial of service vulnerabilities were found in ntpd-rs related
  to the handling of NTS cookies in our client functionality. Whenever an NTS source
  is configured and the server behind that source is sending zero-sized cookies or
  cookies larger than what would fit in our buffer size, ntpd-rs would crash. Only
  configured NTS sources can abuse these vulnerabilities. NTP sources or third parties
  that are not configured cannot make use of these vulnerabilities.\n\nFor zero-sized
  cookies: a division by zero would force an exit when the number of new cookies that
  would need to be requested is calculated. In ntpd-rs 1.5.0 a check was added to
  prevent the division by zero.\n\nFor large cookies: while trying to send a NTP request
  with the cookie included, the buffer is too small to handle the cookie and an exit
  of ntpd-rs is forced once a write to the buffer is attempted. The memory outside
  the buffer would not be written to in this case. In ntpd-rs 1.5.0 a check was added
  that prevents accepting cookies larger than 350 bytes.\n\nUsers of older versions
  of ntpd-rs are recommended to update to the latest version. If an update is impossible,
  it is recommended to only add NTS sources to ntpd-rs that are trusted to not abuse
  this bug."
