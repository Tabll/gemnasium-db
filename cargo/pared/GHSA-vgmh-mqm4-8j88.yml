title: "pared Vulnerable to Use After Free in `Parc` and `Prc` Due to Missing Lifetime
  Constraints"
description: "Affected versions of this crate didn't provide sufficient lifetime constraints
  to conversion functions from `alloc::sync::Arc` and `alloc::rc::Rc`, which made
  it possible to create projections of these reference counted pointers. Unlike the
  original reference counted pointers, these projections could outlive original data's
  lifetimes.\n\nThis projected pointer could cause the original `Arc`'s or `Rc`'s
  `Drop::drop` to get called at a point where the original data was no longer valid,
  leading to a potential use after free.\n\nThe affected functions were\n- `pared::prc::Prc::from_rc`\n-
  `pared::prc::Prc::project`\n- `pared::prc::Prc::try_from_rc`\n- `pared::sync::Parc::from_arc`\n-
  `pared::sync::Parc::project`\n- `pared::sync::Parc::try_from_arc`"
