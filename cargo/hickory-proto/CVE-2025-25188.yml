identifiers:
- "CVE-2025-25188"
- "GHSA-37wc-h8xc-5hc4"
package_slug: "cargo/hickory-proto"
title: "Hickory DNS's DNSSEC validation may accept broken authentication chains"
description: "The DNSSEC validation routines treat entire RRsets of DNSKEY records
  as trusted once they have established trust in only one of the DNSKEYs. As a result,
  if a zone includes a DNSKEY with a public key that matches a configured trust anchor,
  all keys in that zone will be trusted to authenticate other records in the zone.
  There is a second variant of this vulnerability involving DS records, where an authenticated
  DS record covering one DNSKEY leads to trust in signatures made by an unrelated
  DNSKEY in the same zone."
