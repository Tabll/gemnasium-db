title: "Assumed memory layout of std::net::SocketAddr"
description: "The [`socket2`](https://crates.io/crates/socket2) crate has assumed
  `std::net::SocketAddrV4`\nand `std::net::SocketAddrV6` have the same memory layout
  as the system C representation\n`sockaddr`. It has simply casted the pointers to
  convert the socket addresses to the\nsystem representation. The standard library
  does not say anything about the memory\nlayout, and this will cause invalid memory
  access if the standard library\nchanges the implementation. No warnings or errors
  will be emitted once the\nchange happens."
