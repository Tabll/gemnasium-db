title: "panic on parsing crafted phonenumber inputs"
description: "The phonenumber parsing code may panic due to a reachable `assert!`
  guard on the phonenumber string.\n\nIn a typical deployment of rust-phonenumber,
  this may get triggered by feeding a maliciously crafted phonenumber, e.g. over the
  network, specifically strings of the form `+dwPAA;phone-context=AA`, where the \"number\"
  part potentially parses as a number larger than 2^56.\n\nSince f69abee1/0.3.4/#52.\n\n0.2.x
  series is not affected."
