title: "NATS TLS certificate common name validation bypass"
description: "The NATS official Rust clients are vulnerable to MitM when using TLS.\n\nA
  fix for the `nats` crate hasn't been released yet. Since the `nats` crate is going
  to be deprecated anyway, consider switching to `async-nats` `>= 0.29` which already
  fixed this vulnerability.\n\nThe common name of the server's TLS certificate is
  validated against the `host`name provided by the server's plaintext `INFO` message
  during the initial connection setup phase. A MitM proxy can tamper with the `host`
  field's value by substituting it with the common name of a valid certificate it
  controls, fooling the client into accepting it."
