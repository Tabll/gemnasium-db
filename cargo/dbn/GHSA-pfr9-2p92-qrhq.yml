title: "Databento Binary Encoding (DBN) has a heap buffer overflow using c_chars_to_str
  function"
description: "The `heap-buffer-overflow` is triggered in the `strlen()` function when
  handling the `c_chars_to_str` function in the dbn crate. This vulnerability occurs
  because the `CStr::from_ptr()` function in Rust assumes that the provided C string
  is null-terminated. However, there is no guarantee that the input chars array passed
  to the c_chars_to_str function is properly null-terminated.\n\nIf the chars array
  does not contain a null byte (\\0), strlen() will continue to read beyond the bounds
  of the buffer in search of a null terminator. This results in an out-of-bounds memory
  read and can lead to a heap-buffer-overflow, potentially causing memory corruption
  or exposing sensitive information."
