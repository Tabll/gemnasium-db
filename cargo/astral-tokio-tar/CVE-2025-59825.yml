package_slug: "cargo/astral-tokio-tar"
title: "astral-tokio-tar has a path traversal in tar extraction"
description: "In versions 0.5.3 and earlier of astral-tokio-tar, tar archives may
  extract outside of their intended destination directory when using the `Entry::unpack_in_raw`
  API. Additionally, the `Entry::allow_external_symlinks` control (which defaults
  to `true`) could be bypassed via a pair of symlinks that individually point within
  the destination but combine to point outside of it.\n\nThese behaviors could be
  used individually or combined to bypass the intended security control of limiting
  extraction to the given directory. This in turn would allow an attacker with a malicious
  tar archive to perform an arbitrary file write and potentially pivot into code execution
  (e.g. by overwriting a file that the user or system then executes or uses to execute
  code).\n\nThe impact of this vulnerability for downstream API users of this crate
  is **high**, per above. However, for this crate's main downstream user (uv), the
  impact of this vulnerability is **low** due to its overlap with equivalent user
  capabilities in source distributions. See GHSA-7j9j-68r2-f35q for additional details."
