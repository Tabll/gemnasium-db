title: "Lemmy user purging users or communities or banning users can delete images
  they didn't upload/exclusively use"
description: "An improper uploaded media ownership check can result in inadvertent
  deletion of media when a user is banned with content removal or purged. This can
  lead to deletion of media that was not uploaded by the banned/purged user. This
  also applies to purged communities, in which case all media posted in that community
  will get deleted without proper ownership check.\nThis is limited to media with
  an `image/*` content-type returned by pict-rs."
