package_slug: "cargo/lemmy_server"
title: "Any authenticated user may obtain private message details from other users
  on the same instance"
description: "Users can report private messages, even when they're neither sender
  nor recipient of the message.\nThe API response to creating a private message report
  contains the private message itself, which means any user can just iterate over
  message ids to (loudly) obtain all private messages of an instance.\nA user with
  instance admin privileges can also abuse this if the private message is removed
  from the response, as they're able to see the resulting reports."
