title: "Memory corruption in array-tools"
description: "An issue was discovered in the array-tools crate before 0.3.2 for Rust.
  Affected versions of this crate don't guard against panics, so that partially uninitialized
  buffer is dropped when user-provided `T::clone()` panics in `FixedCapacityDequeLike<T,
  A>::clone()`. This causes memory corruption."
