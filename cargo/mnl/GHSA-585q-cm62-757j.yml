title: "mnl has segmentation fault and invalid memory read in `mnl::cb_run`"
description: "The function `mnl::cb_run` is marked as safe but exhibits unsound behavior
  when processing malformed Netlink message buffers.\n\nPassing a crafted byte slice
  to `mnl::cb_run` can trigger memory violations. The function does not sufficiently
  validate the input buffer structure before processing, leading to out-of-bounds
  reads.\n\nThis vulnerability allows an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (segmentation
  fault) or potentially read unmapped memory by providing a malformed Netlink message."
