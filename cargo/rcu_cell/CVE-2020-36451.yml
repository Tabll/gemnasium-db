package_slug: "cargo/rcu_cell"
title: "Data races in rcu_cell"
description: "Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implement Send/Sync
  for `RcuCell<T>`.\nThis allows users to send `T: !Send` to other threads (while
  `T` enclosed within `RcuCell<T>`), and allows users to concurrently access `T: !Sync`
  by using the APIs of `RcuCell<T>` that provide access to `&T`.\n\nThis can result
  in memory corruption caused by data races."
