title: "risc0 vulnerable to arbitrary code execution in guest via memory safety failure
  in `sys_read`"
description: "# Arbitrary code execution in guest via memory safety failure in `sys_read`\n\nIn
  affected versions of `risc0-zkvm-platform`, when the zkVM guest calls `sys_read`,
  the host is able to use a crafted response to write to an arbitrary memory location
  in the guest. This capability can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code within
  the guest. As `sys_read` is the mechanism by which input is requested by the guest,
  all guest programs built with the affected versions are vulnerable. This critically
  compromises the soundness guarantees of the guest program.\n\nA fix was applied
  in [\\#3351](https://github.com/risc0/risc0/pull/3351). The vulnerable pointer arithmetic
  was removed, and replaced with a simplified implementation in the `v1compat` kernel
  which uses Rust’s slice functions to guarantee memory safety.\n\nThe fix has been
  released as part of `risc0-zkvm` versions `2.3.2` and `3.0.3`. All prior versions
  are affected.\n\n## Remediation\n\nAll developers of zkVM applications should update
  their guests to use `risc0-zkvm` versions `^2.3.2` or `^3.0.3`.\n\nThis upgrade
  can be accomplished by editing all `Cargo.toml` files in the following way.\n\n*
  Any references to [`risc0-zkvm`](https://crates.io/crates/risc0-zkvm) should use
  version specifiers `”2.3.2”` or `”3.0.3”`.  \n* Any references to [`risc0-build`](https://crates.io/crates/risc0-build)
  should use version specifiers `”2.3.2”` or `”3.0.3”`, matching `risc0-zkvm`.  \n*
  Any references to [`risc0-zkvm-platform`](https://crates.io/crates/risc0-zkvm-platform)
  should use version specifier `”2.1.0”` or later. Most projects will not have direct
  references to this crate.\n\nRebuild your application including the guest. You can
  run the following command to check that the patch is applied:\n\n```shell\n# Provide
  the path to your guest Cargo.toml. Should report risc0-zkvm-platform >=v2.1.0\ncargo
  tree --depth 0 -p risc0-zkvm-platform --manifest-path path/to/methods/guest/Cargo.toml\n```\n\nAny
  applications that use the image ID of this guest need to be updated with the newly
  built image ID.\n\nNote that there are no changes to the RISC Zero proof system
  or circuits. Provers are not required to take any action. Users of the Groth16 smart
  contract verifier and the [RISC Zero Verifier Router](https://dev.risczero.com/api/blockchain-integration/contracts/verifier#verifier-router)
  are not required to take any action beyond updating their guest programs."
