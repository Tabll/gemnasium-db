package_slug: "cargo/gfwx"
title: "Data races in gfwx"
description: "In the affected versions of this crate, ImageChunkMut<'_, T> unconditionally
  implements Send and Sync, allowing to create data races.\n\nThis can result in a
  memory corruption or undefined behavior when non thread-safe types are moved and
  referenced across thread boundaries.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in commit e7fb2f5
  by adding T: Send bound to the Send impl and adding T: Sync bound to the Sync impl."
