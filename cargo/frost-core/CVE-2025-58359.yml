title: "frost-core: refresh shares with smaller min_signers will reduce security of
  group"
description: "It was not clear that it is not possible to change `min_signers` (i.e.
  the threshold) with the refresh share functionality (`frost_core::keys::refresh`
  module). Using a smaller value would not decrease the threshold, and attempts to
  sign using a smaller threshold would fail. Additionally, after refreshing the shares
  with a smaller threshold, it would still be possible to sign with the original threshold;
  however, this could cause a security loss to the participant's shares. We have not
  determined the exact security implications of doing so and judged simpler to just
  validate `min_signers`.\n\nIf for some reason you have done a refresh share procedure
  with a smaller `min_signers` we strongly recommend migrating to a new key."
