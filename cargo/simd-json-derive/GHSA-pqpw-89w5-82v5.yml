title: "`simd-json-derive` vulnerable to `MaybeUninit` misuse"
description: "An invalid use of `MaybeUninit::uninit().assume_init()` in `simd-json-derive`'s
  derive macro can cause undefined behavior. The original code used `MaybeUninit`
  to avoid initialisation of the struct and then set the fields using `ptr::write`.
  The undefined behavior triggered by this misuse of `MaybeUninit` can lead to invlaid
  memory access and panics in binaries compiled in release mode (aka simd-json-derive
  prior to version 0.12 has UB and optimizes into some nonsense)\n\nThe version `0.12.0`
  removes this section of code, avoiding the use of MaybeUninit alltogether."
