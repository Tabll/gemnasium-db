title: "rusty_paseto vulnerable to private key extraction due to ed25519-dalek dependency"
description: "The vulnerability, known as RUSTSEC-2022-0093, impacts the `ed25519-dalek`
  crate, which is a dependency of the `rusty-paseto` crate. This issue arises from
  a \"Double Public Key Signing Function Oracle Attack\" affecting versions of `ed25519-dalek`
  prior to v2.0. These versions expose an unsafe API for serializing and deserializing
  64-byte keypairs that include both private and public keys, creating potential for
  certain attacks. `d25519-dalek` users utilizing these serialization and deserialization
  functions directly could potentially be impacted."
