title: "Duplicate Advisory: Integer Overflow in HeaderMap::reserve() can cause Denial
  of Service"
description: "### Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it
  is a duplicate of GHSA-x7vr-c387-8w57. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n### Original Description\n\nHeaderMap::reserve() used usize::next_power_of_two()
  to calculate the increased capacity. However, next_power_of_two() silently overflows
  to 0 if given a sufficiently large number in release mode.\n\nIf the map was not
  empty when the overflow happens, the library will invoke self.grow(0) and start
  infinite probing. This allows an attacker who controls the argument to reserve()
  to cause a potential denial of service (DoS).\n\nThe flaw was corrected in 0.1.20
  release of http crate."
