package_slug: "cargo/http"
title: "Integer Overflow/Infinite Loop in the http crate"
description: "HeaderMap::reserve() used usize::next_power_of_two() to calculate the
  increased capacity. However, next_power_of_two() silently overflows to 0 if given
  a sufficiently large number in release mode.\n\nIf the map was not empty when the
  overflow happens, the library will invoke self.grow(0) and start infinite probing.
  This allows an attacker who controls the argument to reserve() to cause a potential
  denial of service (DoS).\n\nThe flaw was corrected in 0.1.20 release of http crate."
