title: "Fyrox has unsound usages of `Vec::from_raw_parts` "
description: "The library provides a public safe API `transmute_vec_as_bytes`, which
  incorrectly assumes that any generic type `T` could have stable layout, causing
  to uninitialized memory exposure if the users pass any types with padding bytes
  as `T` and cast it to `u8` pointer.\n\nIn the [issue](https://github.com/FyroxEngine/Fyrox/issues/630),
  we develop a PoC to show passing struct type to `transmute_vec_as_bytes` could lead
  to undefined behavior with `Vec::from_raw_parts`."
