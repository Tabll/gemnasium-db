title: "vec-const attempts to construct a Vec from a pointer to a const slice"
description: "Affected versions of this crate claimed to construct a const `Vec` with
  nonzero length and capacity, but that cannot be done because such a `Vec` requires
  a pointer from an allocator.\n\nThe implementation was later changed to just construct
  a `std::borrow::Cow`."
