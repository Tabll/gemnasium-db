title: "Unsoundness in `Iterator` and `DoubleEndedIterator` impls for `glib::VariantStrIter`"
description: "The `VariantStrIter::impl_get` function (called internally by implementations
  of the `Iterator` and `DoubleEndedIterator` traits for this type) was unsound, resulting
  in undefined behaviour.\n\nAn immutable reference `&p` to a `*mut libc::c_char`
  pointer initialized to `NULL` was passed as an argument to a C function that that
  mutates the pointer behind `&p` in-place (i.e. as an out-argument), which was unsound.
  After changes in recent versions of the Rust compiler, these unsound writes through
  `&p` now seem to be completely disregarded when building the `glib` crate with optimizations.\n\nThis
  subsequently caused all calls of `VariantStrIter::impl_get` to violate the safety
  requirements of the `std::ffi::CStr::from_ptr` function - which requires its argument
  to be a valid pointer to a C-style string - resulting in crashes due to `NULL` pointer
  dereferences.\n\nThis was fixed by passing the out-argument pointer explitly as
  `&mut p` instead of `&p`.\n\nThis issue has been present since this code was initially
  added in `glib` v0.15.0. The mismatch in mutability was likely missed (and not raised
  as an error by the compiler) because the C function wrapped by `VariantStrIter::impl_get`
  is variadic (`glib_sys::g_variant_get_child`), and the pointer in question is one
  of the variadic arguments."
