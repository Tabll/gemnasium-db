package_slug: "cargo/stackvector"
title: "Out of bounds write in stackvector"
description: "StackVec::extend used the lower and upper bounds from an Iterator's
  size_hint to determine how many items to push into the stack based vector. If the
  size_hint implementation returned a lower bound that was larger than the upper bound,
  StackVec would write out of bounds and overwrite memory on the stack. As mentioned
  by the size_hint documentation, size_hint is mainly for optimization and incorrect
  implementations should not lead to memory safety issues."
