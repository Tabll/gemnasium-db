title: "crayon: ObjectPool creates uninitialized memory when freeing objects"
description: "As of version 0.6.0, the ObjectPool explicitly creates an uninitialized
  instance of its type parameter when it attempts to free an object, and swaps it
  into the storage. This causes instant undefined behavior due to reading the uninitialized
  memory in order to write it to the pool storage.\n\nExtremely basic usage of the
  crate can trigger this issue, e.g. this code from a doctest:\n\n```rust\nuse crayon::prelude::*;\napplication::oneshot().unwrap();\n\nlet
  mut params = MeshParams::default();\n\nlet mesh = video::create_mesh(params, None).unwrap();\n\n//
  Deletes the mesh object.\nvideo::delete_mesh(mesh); // <-- UB\n```\n\nThe Clippy
  warning for this code was silenced in commit c2fde19caf6149d91faa504263f0bc5cafc35de5.\n\nDiscovered
