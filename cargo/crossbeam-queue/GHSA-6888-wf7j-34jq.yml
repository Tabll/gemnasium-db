title: "`SegQueue` creates zero value of any type"
description: "Affected versions of this crate called `mem::zeroed()` to create values
  of a user-supplied type `T`.\nThis is unsound e.g. if `T` is a reference type (which
  must be non-null).\n\nThe flaw was corrected by avoiding the use of `mem::zeroed()`,
  using `MaybeUninit` instead."
