package_slug: "cargo/cggmp24"
title: "cggmp24 and cggmp21 are vulnerable to signature forgery through altered presignatures"
description: "This attack is against presignatures used in very specific context:\n*
  Presignatures + HD wallets derivation: security level reduces to 85 bits \\\nPreviously
  users could generate a presignature, and then choose a HD derivation path while
  issuing a partial signature via [`Presignature::set_derivation_path`](https://docs.rs/cggmp21/0.6.3/cggmp21/signing/struct.Presignature.html#method.set_derivation_path),
  which is malleable to attack that reduces target security level. To mitigate, this
  method has been removed from API.\n* Presignatures + \"raw signing\" (when signer
  signs a hash without knowing an original message): results into signature forgery
  attack \\\nPreviously, users were able to configure [`Presignature::issue_partial_signature`](https://docs.rs/cggmp21/0.6.3/cggmp21/signing/struct.Presignature.html#method.issue_partial_signature)
  with hashed message without ever providing original mesage. In new API, this method
  only accepts digests for which original message has been observed."
