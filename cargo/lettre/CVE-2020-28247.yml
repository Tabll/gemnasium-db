title: "Argument injection in lettre"
description: "Affected versions of lettre allowed argument injection to the sendmail
  command. It was possible, using forged to addresses, to pass arbitrary arguments
  to the sendmail executable.\n\nDepending on the implementation (original sendmail,
  postfix, exim, etc.) it could be possible in some cases to write email data into
  abritrary files (using sendmail's logging features).\n\n*NOTE*: This vulnerability
  only affects the sendmail transport. Others, including smtp, are not affected."
