package_slug: "cargo/rusb"
title: "Data races in rusb"
description: "Affected versions of rusb did not require UsbContext to implement Send
  and Sync. However, through Device and DeviceHandle it is possible to use UsbContexts
  across threads. This issue allows non-thread safe UsbContext types to be used concurrently
  leading to data races and memory corruption. The issue was fixed by adding Send
  and Sync bounds to UsbContext."
