title: "MutexGuard::map can cause a data race in safe code"
description: "Affected versions of the crate had a Send/Sync implementation for MappedMutexGuard
  that only considered variance on T, while MappedMutexGuard dereferenced to U.\n\nThis
  could of led to data races in safe Rust code when a closure used in MutexGuard::map()
  returns U that is unrelated to T.\n\nThe issue was fixed by fixing Send and Sync
  implementations, and by adding a PhantomData<&'a mut U> marker to the MappedMutexGuard
  type to tell the compiler that the guard is over U too."
