title: "mail-internals use-after-free vulnerability in `vec_insert_bytes`"
description: "Incorrect reallocation logic in the function [`vec_insert_bytes`](https://docs.rs/mail-internals/0.2.3/mail_internals/utils/fn.vec_insert_bytes.html)
  causes a use-after-free.\n\nThis function does not have to be called directly to
  trigger the vulnerability because many methods on [`EncodingWriter`](https://docs.rs/mail-internals/0.2.3/mail_internals/encoder/struct.EncodingWriter.html)
  call this function internally.\n\nThe mail-\\* suite is unmaintained and the upstream
  sources have been actively vandalised.\nA fixed `mail-internals-ng` (and `mail-headers-ng`
  and `mail-core-ng`) crate has been published which fixes this, and a dependency
  on another unsound crate."
