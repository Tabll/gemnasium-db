title: "wasmtime_jit_debug Dumps Undefined Memory by `JitDumpFile`"
description: "The unsound function `dump_code_load_record` uses `from_raw_parts` to
  directly convert the pointer `addr` and `len` into a slice without any validation
  and that memory block would be dumped.\n\nThus, the 'safe' function dump_code_load_record
  is actually 'unsafe' since it requires the caller to guarantee that the addr is
  valid and len must not overflow. Otherwise, the function could dump the memory into
  file illegally, causing memory leak.\n\n> **Note**: this is an internal-only crate
  in the Wasmtime project not intended for external use and is more strongly signaled
  nowadays as of [bytecodealliance/wasmtime#10963](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10963).
  Please open an issue in Wasmtime if you're using this crate directly."
