title: "Pingora update for MadeYouReset HTTP/2 vulnerability"
description: "Pingora deployments that include HTTP/2 server support may be affected
  by the vulnerability described in CVE-2025-8671. Under certain conditions, Pingora
  applications may allocate buffers before the HTTP/2 reset and resulting stream cancellation
  is processed by the server. Repeated resets can force excessive memory consumption
  and lead to denial-of-service.\n\n**Impact**:\nOn affected versions, malicious clients
  could trigger unusually high memory consumption, which may result in service instability
  or process termination.\n\n**Credits**:\nReported responsibly by security researcher
  [Gal Bar Nahum](https://github.com/galbarnahum) (@[galbarnahum](https://github.com/galbarnahum))\n\n**Mitigation**:\nThis
  issue is addressed by ensuring Pingora uses patched versions of HTTP/2 dependencies
  that include reset-handling safeguards to release connection resources before excessive
  memory buildup. Users should upgrade to the latest Pingora release, which incorporates
  the required fixes.\n- Users are requested to upgrade to latest version of Pingora
  >= 0.6.0"
