package_slug: "cargo/pingora-core"
title: "Pingora Request Smuggling and Cache Poisoning"
description: "Pingora versions prior to 0.5.0 which used the caching functionality
  in pingora-proxy did not properly drain the downstream request body on cache hits.\n\nThis
  allows an attacker to craft malicious HTTP/1.1 requests which could lead to request
  smuggling or cache poisoning.\n\nThis flaw was corrected in commit fda3317ec822678564d641e7cf1c9b77ee3759ff
  by ensuring that the downstream request body is always drained before a connection
  can be reused.\n\nSee [the blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/resolving-a-request-smuggling-vulnerability-in-pingora/)
  for more information."
