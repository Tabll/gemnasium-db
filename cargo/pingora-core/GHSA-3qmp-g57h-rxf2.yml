title: "Duplicate Advisory: Pingora Request Smuggling and Cache Poisoning"
description: "### Duplicate Advisory\n\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it
  is a duplicate of GHSA-93c7-7xqw-w357. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n### Original Description\n\nPingora versions prior to 0.5.0 which
  used the caching functionality in pingora-proxy did not properly drain the downstream
  request body on cache hits.\n\nThis allows an attacker to craft malicious HTTP/1.1
  requests which could lead to request smuggling or cache poisoning.\n\nThis flaw
  was corrected in commit fda3317ec822678564d641e7cf1c9b77ee3759ff by ensuring that
  the downstream request body is always drained before a connection can be reused.\n\nSee
  [the blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/resolving-a-request-smuggling-vulnerability-in-pingora/)
  for more information."
