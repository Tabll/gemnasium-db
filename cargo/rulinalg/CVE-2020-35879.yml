package_slug: "cargo/rulinalg"
title: "Data races in rulinalg"
description: "The affected version of rulinalg has incorrect lifetime boundary definitions
  for RowMut::raw_slice and RowMut::raw_slice_mut. They do not conform with Rust's
  borrowing rule and allows the user to create multiple mutable references to the
  same location. This may result in unexpected calculation result and data race if
  both references are used at the same time."
