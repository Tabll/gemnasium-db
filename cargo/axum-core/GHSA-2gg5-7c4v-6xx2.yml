description: "## Duplicate advisory\nThis advisory is a duplicate of [GHSA-m77f-652q-wwp4](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m77f-652q-wwp4).
  This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n## Original Description\n<bytes::Bytes
  as axum_core::extract::FromRequest>::from_request would not, by default, set a limit
  for the size of the request body. That meant if a malicious peer would send a very
  large (or infinite) body your server might run out of memory and crash. This also
  applies to these extractors which used Bytes::from_request internally: axum::extract::Form
  axum::extract::Json String"
