- "GHSA-vjrq-cg9x-rfjp"
package_slug: "cargo/cookie"
title: "Improper Input Validation in cookie"
description: "Affected versions of this crate use the time crate and the method Duration::seconds
  to parse the Max-Age duration cookie setting. This method will panic if the value
  is greater than 2^64/1000 and less than or equal to 2^64, which can result in denial
  of service for a client or server.\n\nThis flaw was corrected by explicitly checking
  for the Max-Age being in this integer range and clamping the value to the maximum
  duration value."
