package_slug: "cargo/scratchpad"
title: "move_elements can double-free objects on panic"
description: "Affected versions of scratchpad used ptr::read to read elements while
  calling a user provided function f on them. Since the pointer read duplicates ownership,
  a panic inside the user provided f function could cause a double free when unwinding.\n\nThe
  flaw was fixed in commit `891561bea` by removing the unsafe block and using a plain
  iterator."
