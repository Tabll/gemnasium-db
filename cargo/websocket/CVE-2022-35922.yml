title: "Rust-WebSocket memory allocation based on untrusted length"
description: "Untrusted websocket connections can cause an out-of-memory (OOM) process
  abort in a client or a server.\nThe root cause of the issue is during dataframe
  parsing.\nAffected versions would allocate a buffer based on the declared dataframe
  size, which may come from an untrusted source.\nWhen `Vec::with_capacity` fails
  to allocate, the default Rust allocator will abort the current process, killing
  all threads. This affects only sync (non-Tokio) implementation. Async version also
  does not limit memory, but does not use `with_capacity`, so DoS can happen only
  when bytes for oversized dataframe or message actually got delivered by the attacker.\n\nThis
  is a security concern for you, if\n- your server application handles untrusted websocket
  connections\n- OR your client application connects to untrusted websocket servers"
