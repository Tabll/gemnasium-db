title: "h2 servers vulnerable to degradation of service with CONTINUATION Flood"
description: "An attacker can send a flood of CONTINUATION frames, causing `h2` to
  process them indefinitely. This results in an increase in CPU usage.\n\nTokio task
  budget helps prevent this from a complete denial-of-service, as the server can still
  respond to legitimate requests, albeit with increased latency.\n\nMore details at
  https://seanmonstar.com/blog/hyper-http2-continuation-flood/.\n\nPatches available
  for 0.4.x and 0.3.x versions."
