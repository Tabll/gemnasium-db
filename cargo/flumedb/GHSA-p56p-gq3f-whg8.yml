title: "`Read` on uninitialized buffer may cause UB ( `read_entry()` )"
description: "Affected versions of this crate passes an uninitialized buffer to a
  user-provided `Read` implementation.\nThere are two of such cases (`go_offset_log::read_entry()`
  & `offset_log::read_entry()`).\n\nArbitrary `Read` implementations can read from
  the uninitialized buffer (memory exposure) and also can return incorrect number
  of bytes written to the buffer.\nReading from uninitialized memory produces undefined
  values that can quickly invoke undefined behavior."
