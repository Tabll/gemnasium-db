package_slug: "cargo/flumedb"
title: "Use of Uninitialized Resource in flumedb."
description: "Affected versions of this crate passes an uninitialized buffer to a
  user-provided Read implementation. There are two of such cases (go_offset_log::read_entry()
  & offset_log::read_entry()).\n\nArbitrary Read implementations can read from the
  uninitialized buffer (memory exposure) and also can return incorrect number of bytes
  written to the buffer. Reading from uninitialized memory produces undefined values
  that can quickly invoke undefined behavior."
