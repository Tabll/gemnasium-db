package_slug: "cargo/reorder"
title: "Out of bounds write in reorder"
description: "swap_index takes an iterator and swaps the items with their corresponding
  indexes. It reserves capacity and sets the length of the vector based on the .len()
  method of the iterator.\n\nIf the len() returned by the iterator is larger than
  the actual number of elements yielded, then swap_index creates a vector containing
  uninitialized members. If the len() returned by the iterator is smaller than the
  actual number of members yielded, then swap_index can write out of bounds past its
  allocated vector.\n\nAs noted by the Rust documentation, len() and size_hint() are
  primarily meant for optimization and incorrect values from their implementations
  should not lead to memory safety violations."
