- "GHSA-2f5j-3mhq-xv58"
package_slug: "cargo/sys-info"
title: "Double free in sys-info "
description: "Affected versions of sys-info use a static, global, list to store temporary
  disk information while running. The function that cleans up this list, DFCleanup,
  assumes a single threaded environment and will try to free the same memory twice
  in a multithreaded environment. This results in consistent double-frees and segfaults
  when calling sys_info::disk_info from multiple threads at once. The issue was fixed
  by moving the global variable into a local scope."
