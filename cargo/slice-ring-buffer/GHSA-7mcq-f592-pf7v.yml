title: "Slice Ring Buffer and Slice Deque contains four unique double-free vulnerabilities
  triggered through safe APIs"
description: "The crate [`slice-ring-buffer`](https://crates.io/crates/slice-ring-buffer)
  was developed as a fork of [`slice-deque`](https://crates.io/crates/slice-deque)
  to continue maintenance and provide security patches, since the latter has been
  officially unmaintained ([RUSTSEC-2020-0158](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2020-0158.html)).\n\nWhile
  `slice-ring-buffer` has addressed some previously reported memory safety issues
  inherited from its fork origin ([RUSTSEC-2021-0047](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2021-0047.html)),
  it still retains multiple unresolved memory corruption vulnerabilities.\n\nSpecifically,
  we have discovered four new memory safety bugs, each resulting in double-free violations
  that can occur when only safe APIs are invoked. These vulnerabilities correspond
  to four distinct safe APIs in the crate, each exposing unsound and vulnerable behavior
  due to incorrect usage of unsafe code internally.\n\nUnfortunately, the maintainer
  doesn't have much availability to resolve these issues so there's no concrete timeline
  for fixes. Community contributions towards fixing these vulnerabilities would be
  much appreciated."
