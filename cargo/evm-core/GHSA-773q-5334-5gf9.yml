title: "Memory over-allocation in evm-core"
description: "Prior to the patch, when executing specific EVM opcodes related\nto
  memory operations that use `evm_core::Memory::copy_large`, the\ncrate can over-allocate
  memory when it is not needed, making it\npossible for an attacker to perform denial-of-service
  attack.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in commit `19ade85`."
