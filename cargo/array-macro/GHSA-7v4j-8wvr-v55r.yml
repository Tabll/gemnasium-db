title: "`array!` macro is unsound when its length is impure constant"
description: "Affected versions of this crate did substitute the array length provided
  by an user at compile-time multiple times.\n\nWhen an impure constant expression
  is passed as an array length (such as a result of an impure procedural macro), this
  can result in the initialization of an array with uninitialized types, which in
  turn can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.\n\nThe flaw was corrected
  in commit [d5b63f72](https://github.com/xfix/array-macro/commit/d5b63f72090f3809c21ac28f9cfd84f12559bf7d)
  by making sure that array length is substituted just once."
