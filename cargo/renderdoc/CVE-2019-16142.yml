package_slug: "cargo/renderdoc"
title: "Improper Input Validation in renderdoc"
description: "Affected versions of this crate exposed several methods which took self
  by immutable reference, despite the requesting the RenderDoc API to set a mutable
  value internally. This is technically unsound and calling these methods from multiple
  threads without synchronization could lead to unexpected and unpredictable behavior.
  The flaw was corrected in release 0.5.0."
