title: "smallvec creates uninitialized value of any type"
description: "Affected versions of this crate called `mem::uninitialized()` to create
  values of a user-supplied type `T`.\nThis is unsound e.g. if `T` is a reference
  type (which must be non-null and thus may not remain uninitialized).\n\nThe flaw
  was corrected by avoiding the use of `mem::uninitialized()`, using `MaybeUninit`
  instead."
