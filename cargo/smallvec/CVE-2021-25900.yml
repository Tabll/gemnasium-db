title: "Buffer overflow in SmallVec::insert_many"
description: "A bug in the SmallVec::insert_many method caused it to allocate a buffer
  that was smaller than needed. It then wrote past the end of the buffer, causing
  a buffer overflow and memory corruption on the heap. This bug was only triggered
  if the iterator passed to insert_many yielded more items than the lower bound returned
  from its size_hint method.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in smallvec 0.6.14 and 1.6.1,
  by ensuring that additional space is always reserved for each item inserted. The
  fix also simplified the implementation of insert_many to use less unsafe code, so
  it is easier to verify its correctness."
