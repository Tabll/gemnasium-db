package_slug: "cargo/salvo"
title: "Salvo is vulnerable to reflected XSS in the list_html function"
description: "The function `list_html` generates an file view of a folder which includes
  a render of the current path, in which its inserted in the HTML without proper sanitation,
  leading to reflected XSS. The request path is decoded and normalized in the matching
  stage but is not inserted raw in the HTML view (current.path). The only constraint
  here is for the root path (e.g., /files in the PoC example) to have a subdirectory
  (e. g., common ones like styles/scripts/etc.) so that the matching returns the list
  HTML page instead of the Not Found page."
