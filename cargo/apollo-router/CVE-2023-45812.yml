package_slug: "cargo/apollo-router"
title: "Apollo Router vulnerable to Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions"
description: "The Apollo Router is a configurable, high-performance graph router written
  in Rust to run a federated supergraph that uses Apollo Federation. Affected versions
  are subject to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) type vulnerability which causes the Router
  to panic and terminate when a multi-part response is sent. When users send queries
  to the router that uses the `@defer` or Subscriptions, the Router will panic.\n\nTo
  be vulnerable, users of Router must have a coprocessor with `coprocessor.supergraph.response`
  configured in their `router.yaml` and also to support either `@defer` or Subscriptions."
