title: "Apollo Router Improperly Enforces Renamed Access Control Directives"
description: "A vulnerability in Apollo Router allowed for unauthorized access to
  protected data through schema elements with access control directives (`@authenticated`,
  `@requiresScopes`, and `@policy`) that were renamed via `@link` imports. Router
  did not enforce renamed access control directives on schema elements (e.g. fields
  and types), allowing queries to bypass those element-level access controls."
