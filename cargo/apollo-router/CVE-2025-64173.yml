title: "Apollo Router Affected by an Access Control Bypass on Polymorphic Types"
description: "A vulnerability in Apollo Router allowed for unauthenticated queries
  to access data that required additional access controls. Router incorrectly handled
  access control directives on interface types/fields and their implementing object
  types/fields, applying them to interface types/fields while ignoring directives
  on their implementing object types/fields when all implementations had the same
  requirements."
