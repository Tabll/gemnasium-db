title: "Inventory fails to prohibit standard library access prior to initialization
  of Rust standard library runtime"
description: "Affected versions allow arbitrary caller-provided code to execute before
  the lifetime of `main`.\n\nIf the caller-provided code accesses particular pieces
  of the standard library that require an initialized Rust runtime, such as `std::io`
  or `std::thread`, these may not behave as documented. Panics are likely; UB is possible.\n\nThe
  flaw was corrected by enforcing that only code written within the `inventory` crate,
  which is guaranteed not to access runtime-dependent parts of the standard library,
  runs before `main`. Caller-provided code is restricted to running at compile time."
