title: "Inventory exposes reference to non-Sync data to an arbitrary thread"
description: "Affected versions do not enforce a `Sync` bound on the type of caller-provided
  value held in the plugin registry. References to these values are made accessible
  to arbitrary threads other than the one that constructed them.\n\nA caller could
  use this flaw to submit thread-unsafe data into inventory, then access it as a reference
  simultaneously from multiple threads.\n\nThe flaw was corrected by enforcing that
  data submitted by the caller into inventory is `Sync`."
