title: "HPACK decoder panics on invalid input"
description: "Due to insufficient checking of input data, decoding certain data sequences
  can lead to _Decoder::decode_ panicking rather than returning an error.\n\nExample
  code that triggers this vulnerability looks like this:\n\n```rust\nuse hpack::Decoder;\n\npub
  fn main() {\nlet input = &[0x3f];\nlet mut decoder = Decoder::new();\nlet _ = decoder.decode(input);\n}\n```\n\nhpack
  is unmaintained. A crate with the panics fixed has been published as [hpack-patched](https://crates.io/crates/hpack-patched).\n\nAlso
  consider using [fluke-hpack](https://crates.io/crates/fluke-hpack) or [httlib-huffman](https://crates.io/crates/httlib-huffman)
  as an alternative."
