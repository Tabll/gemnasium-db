package_slug: "cargo/libp2p"
title: "libp2p DoS vulnerability from lack of resource management"
description: "An attacker node can cause a victim node to allocate a large number
  of small memory chunks, which can ultimately lead to the victimâ€™s process running
  out of memory and thus getting killed by its operating system. When executed continuously,
  this can lead to a denial of service attack, especially relevant on a larger scale
  when run against more than one node of a libp2p based network."
