title: "RustEmbed generated `get` method allows for directory traversal when reading
  files from disk"
description: "When running in debug mode and the `debug-embed` (off by default) feature
  is\nnot enabled, the generated `get` method does not check that the input path is\na
  child of the folder given.\n\nThis allows attackers to read arbitrary files in the
  file system if they have\ncontrol over the filename given. The following code will
  print the contents of\nyour `/etc/passwd` if adjusted with a correct number of `../`s
  depending on\nwhere it is run from.\n\n```rust"
