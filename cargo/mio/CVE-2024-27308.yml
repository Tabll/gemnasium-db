title: "Mio's tokens for named pipes may be delivered after deregistration"
description: "When using named pipes on Windows, mio will under some circumstances
  return invalid tokens that correspond to named pipes that have already been deregistered
  from the mio registry. The impact of this vulnerability depends on how mio is used.
  For some applications, invalid tokens may be ignored or cause a warning or a crash.
  On the other hand, for applications that store pointers in the tokens, this vulnerability
  may result in a use-after-free.\n\nFor users of Tokio, this vulnerability is serious
  and can result in a use-after-free in Tokio.\n\nThe vulnerability is Windows-specific,
  and can only happen if you are using named pipes. Other IO resources are not affected."
