title: "CosmWasm affected by arithmetic overflows"
description: "Some mathematical operations in `cosmwasm-std` use wrapping math instead
  of\npanicking on overflow for very big numbers. This can lead to wrong calculations
  in contracts\nthat use these operations.\n\nAffected functions:\n\n- `Uint{256,512}::pow`
  / `Int{256,512}::pow`\n- `Int{256,512}::neg`\n\nAffected if `overflow-checks = true`
  is not set:\n\n- `Uint{64,128}::pow` / `Int{64,128}::pow`\n- `Int{64,128}::neg`"
