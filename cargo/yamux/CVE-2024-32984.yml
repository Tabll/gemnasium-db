title: "Yamux Memory Exhaustion Vulnerability via Active::pending_frames property "
description: "Attack scenario\nThe Rust implementation of the Yamux stream multiplexer
  uses a vector for pending frames. This vector is not bounded in length. Every time
  the Yamux protocol requires sending of a new frame, this frame gets appended to
  this vector. This can be remotely triggered in a number of ways, for example by:\n\n1.
  Opening a new libp2p Identify stream. This causes the node to send its Identify
  message. Of course, every other protocol that causes the sending of data also works.
  The larger the response, the more data is enqueued.\n2. Sending a Yamux Ping frame.
  This causes a Pong frame to be enqueued.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, this queue
  of pending frames would be drained once they’re sent out over the network. However,
  the attacker can use TCP’s receive window mechanism to prevent the victim from sending
  out any data: By not reading from the TCP connection, the receive window will never
  be increased, and the victim won’t be able to send out any new data (this is how
  TCP implements backpressure). Once this happens, Yamux’s queue of pending frames
  will start growing indefinitely. The queue will only be drained once the underlying
  TCP connection is closed.\n\nComponents\nhttps://github.com/libp2p/rust-yamux/blob/yamux-v0.13.1/yamux/src/connection.rs#L289"
