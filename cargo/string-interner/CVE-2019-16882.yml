package_slug: "cargo/string-interner"
title: "Use after free in string-interner"
description: "Affected versions of this crate did not clone contained strings when
  an interner is cloned. Interners have raw pointers to the contained strings, and
  they keep pointing the strings which the old interner owns, after the interner is
  cloned. If a new cloned interner is alive and the old original interner is dead,
  the new interner has dangling pointers to the old interner's storage, which is already
  dropped.\n\nThis allows an attacker to read the already freed memory. The dangling
  pointers are used by the interners to check a string is already interned. An attacker
  can do brute force attack to get the data pointed by the dangling pointer."
