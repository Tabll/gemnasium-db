description: "- `OwningRef::map_with_owner` is [unsound](https://github.com/Kimundi/owning-ref-rs/issues/77)
  and may result in a use-after-free.\n- `OwningRef::map` is [unsound](https://github.com/Kimundi/owning-ref-rs/issues/71)
  and may result in a use-after-free.\n- `OwningRefMut::as_owner` and `OwningRefMut::as_owner_mut`
  are [unsound](https://github.com/Kimundi/owning-ref-rs/issues/61) and may result
  in a use-after-free.\n- The crate [violates Rust's aliasing rules](https://github.com/Kimundi/owning-ref-rs/issues/49),
  which may cause miscompilations on recent compilers that emit the LLVM `noalias`
  attribute.\n\nNo patched versions are available at this time. While a pull request
  with some fixes is outstanding, the maintainer appears to be unresponsive."
