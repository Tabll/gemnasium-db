package_slug: "cargo/trust-dns-proto"
title: "Uncontrolled recursion in trust-dns-proto"
description: "There's a stack overflow leading to a crash when Trust-DNS's parses
  a malicious DNS packet. Affected versions of this crate did not properly handle
  parsing of DNS message compression (RFC1035 section 4.1.4). The parser could be
  tricked into infinite loop when a compression offset pointed back to the same domain
  name to be parsed. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious DNS packet which
  when consumed with Trust-DNS could cause stack overflow and crash the affected software."
