title: "tokio-boring vulnerable to resource exhaustion via memory leak"
description: "The tokio-boring library in version 4.0.0 is affected by a memory leak
  issue that can lead to excessive resource consumption and potential DoS by resource
  exhaustion. The `set_ex_data` function used by the library did not deallocate memory
  used by pre-existing data in memory each time after completing a TLS connection
  causing the program to consume more resources with each new connection."
