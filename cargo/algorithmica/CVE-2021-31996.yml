package_slug: "cargo/algorithmica"
title: "Double free in algorithmica"
description: "An issue was discovered in the algorithmica crate through 2021-03-07
  for Rust. In the affected versions of this crate, `merge_sort::merge()` wildly duplicates
  and drops ownership of `T` without guarding against double-free. Due to such implementation,
  simply invoking `merge_sort::merge()` on `Vec<T: Drop>` can cause **double free**
  bugs."
