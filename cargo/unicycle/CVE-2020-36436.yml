package_slug: "cargo/unicycle"
title: "Data races in unicycle"
description: "Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implemented `Send` &
  `Sync` for types `PinSlab<T>` & `Unordered<T, S>`. This allows sending non-Send
  types to other threads and concurrently accessing non-Sync types from multiple threads.\n\nThis
  can result in a data race & memory corruption when types that provide internal mutability
  without synchronization are contained within `PinSlab<T>` or `Unordered<T, S>` and
  accessed concurrently from multiple threads.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in commits
  92f40b4 & 6a6c367 by adding trait bound `T: Send` to `Send` impls for `PinSlab<T>`
  & `Unordered<T, S>` and adding `T: Sync` to `Sync` impls for `PinSlab<T>` & `Unordered<T,
  S>`."
