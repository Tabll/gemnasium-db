title: "SurrealDB vulnerable to Improper Authentication when Changing Databases as
  Scope User"
description: "Authentication would not be properly validated when an already authenticated
  scope user would use the `use` method or `USE` clause to switch working databases
  in a session. If there was a user record in the new database with identical record
  identifier as the original record that the user authenticated with in the original
  database, this could result in the user being able to perform actions under the
  identity of the unrelated user in the new database. This issue does not affect system
  users at any level.\n\nBy default, record identifiers are randomly generated with
  sufficient complexity to prevent the identifier collision required to trigger this
  issue. However, the issue may trigger in situations where multiple databases in
  the same SurrealDB instance are using explicitly defined or incremental record identifiers
  to identify users on an identically named table."
