title: "SurrealDB has Silent Failure to Overwrite Table Definition of Relation Type"
description: "The `OVERWRITE` clause of the `DEFINE TABLE` statement would fail to
  overwrite data for tables that were defined with `TYPE RELATION`. Since table definitions
  include the `PERMISSIONS` clause, this failure would result in permissions not being
  overwritten as a result, which may potentially lead users to believe they have changed
  the table permissions when they have not."
