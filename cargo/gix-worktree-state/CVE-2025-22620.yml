title: "gix-worktree-state nonexclusive checkout sets executable files world-writable"
description: "`gix-worktree-state` specifies 0777 permissions when checking out executable
  files, intending that the umask will restrict them appropriately. But one of the
  strategies it uses to set permissions is not subject to the umask. This causes files
  in a repository to be world-writable in some situations."
