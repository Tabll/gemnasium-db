title: "rustix's `rustix::fs::Dir` iterator with the `linux_raw` backend can cause
  memory explosion"
description: "When using `rustix::fs::Dir` using the `linux_raw` backend, it's possible
  for the iterator to \"get stuck\" when an IO error is encountered. Combined with
  a memory over-allocation issue in `rustix::fs::Dir::read_more`, this can cause quick
  and unbounded memory explosion (gigabytes in a few seconds if used on a hot path)
  and eventually lead to an OOM crash of the application."
