package_slug: "cargo/pleezer"
title: "Pleezer resource exhaustion through uncollected hook script processes"
description: "Hook scripts in pleezer can be triggered by various events like track
  changes and playback state changes. In affected versions, these scripts were spawned
  without proper process cleanup, leaving zombie processes in the system's process
  table.\n\nEven during normal usage, every track change and playback event would
  leave behind zombie processes. This leads to inevitable resource exhaustion over
  time as the system's process table fills up, eventually preventing new processes
  from being created. The issue is exacerbated if events occur rapidly, whether through
  normal use (e.g., skipping through a playlist) or potential manipulation of the
  Deezer Connect protocol traffic.\n\nThis vulnerability affects all users who have
  configured hook scripts using the `--hook` option."
