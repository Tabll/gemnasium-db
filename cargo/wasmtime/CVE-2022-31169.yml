title: "Cranelift vulnerable to miscompilation of constant values in division on AArch64"
description: "There was a bug in Wasmtime's code generator, Cranelift, for AArch64
  targets where constant divisors could result in incorrect division results at runtime.
  The translation rules for constants did not take into account whether sign- or zero-extension
  should happen, which resulted in an incorrect value being placed into a register
  when a division was encountered. For example, a constant 32-bit unsigned divisor
  of `0xfffffffe` would be incorrectly sign-extended to 64-bits to `0xfffffffffffffffe`.
  Any kind of division of operands smaller than 64 bits is implemented with a 64-bit
  division instruction which would then result in an incorrect result because the
  divisor was larger than expected.\n\nThe impact of this bug is that programs executing
  within the WebAssembly sandbox would not behave according to the WebAssembly specification.
  This means that it is hypothetically possible for execution within the sandbox to
  go awry and WebAssembly programs could produce unexpected results. This should not
  impact hosts executing WebAssembly, but does affect the correctness of guest programs.\n\nThis
  bug was found with differential fuzzing of Wasmtime against other engines on the
  AArch64 platform. Fuzzing on AArch64 is not regularly performed at this time and
  the Wasmtime team is investigating how best to continuously fuzz AArch64 in the
  same manner as x86_64."
