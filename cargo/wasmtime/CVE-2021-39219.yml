title: "Wrong type for `Linker`-define functions when used across two `Engine`s"
description: "As a Rust library the `wasmtime` crate clearly marks which functions
  are safe and which are `unsafe`, guaranteeing that if consumers never use `unsafe`
  then it should not be possible to have memory unsafety issues in their embeddings
  of Wasmtime. An issue was discovered in the safe API of `Linker::func_*` APIs. These
  APIs were previously not sound when one `Engine` was used to create the `Linker`
  and then a different `Engine` was used to create a `Store` and then the `Linker`
  was used to instantiate a module into that `Store`. Cross-`Engine` usage of functions
  is not supported in Wasmtime and this can result in type confusion of function pointers,
  resulting in being able to safely call a function with the wrong type.\n\nTriggering
  this bug requires using at least two `Engine` values in an embedding and then additionally
  using two different values with a `Linker` (one at the creation time of the `Linker`
  and another when instantiating a module with the `Linker`).\n\nIt's expected that
  usage of more-than-one `Engine` in an embedding is relatively rare since an `Engine`
  is intended to be a globally shared resource, so the expectation is that the impact
  of this issue is relatively small.\n\nThe fix implemented is to change this behavior
  to `panic!()` in Rust instead of silently allowing it. Using different `Engine`
  instances with a `Linker` is a programmer bug that `wasmtime` catches at runtime."
