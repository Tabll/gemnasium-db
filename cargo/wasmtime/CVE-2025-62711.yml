title: "Wasmtime vulnerable to segfault when using component resources"
description: "The implementation of component-model related host-to-wasm trampolines
  in Wasmtime contained a bug where it's possible to carefully craft a component,
  which when called in a specific way, would crash the host with a segfault or assert
  failure. This bug was introduced in the release of Wasmtime 38.0.0 and affects it
  subsequent patch releases of 38.0.1 and 38.0.2. No other versions of Wasmtime are
  affected.\n\nIn Wasmtime 38 the implementation of host-to-wasm trampolines was refactored
  to remove the old usage of `setjmp` and `longjmp` to unwind the stack. In this transition,
  however, trampolines for component-model intrinsics were accidentally not updated
  meaning that they didn't update runtime data structures as the other host-to-wasm
  trampolines did. If an error ocurred during execution of wasm it would then try
  to read this runtime data which isn't present, and processing it could then result
  in a crash. For example one piece of runtime data is where to jump to in the case
  of a trap, and this is intended to be updated by trampolines during their execution.
  In this situation the trampoline didn't do anything meaning that the value was left
  set to 0 meaning that execution would jump to the 0 address and deterministically
  crash the program with a segfault.\n\nComponent intrinsic host-to-wasm trampolines
  are not typically used in most situations. These only exist for carefully crafted
  components no toolchain would conventionally produce. For example if the `resource.rep`
  intrinsic were directly lifted without having any other wasm in play then it would
  use the component intrinsic host-to-wasm trampoline. This effectively means that
  any component required to trigger this bug would have to be carefully crafted for
  this specific issue. Furthermore triggering this bug would require that these intrinsics
  are called from the host which requires specific type signatures to be used. Not
  all embeddings may be invoking functions with exactly the right type signatures,
  meaning that even if a component could be crafted a pre-built embedding may still
  not be able to run the component.\n\nOverall the goal of Wasmtime's API is that,
  without `unsafe` in Rust, it should not be possible to crash the runtime. With Wasmtime
  38.0.{0,1,2} it is possible to crash the runtime, however, hence this security issue.
  Actually exploiting this in practice would require (a) carefully crafted components,
  (b) a very specific host embedder using the right type signatures, and (c) a host
  that updated to 38.0.{0,1,2} within the last few days (38.0.0 was released on 2025-10-20,
  and this is being published on 2025-10-24). This likely means that almost no embedding
  is affected, but this security issue is nonetheless being posted for awareness."
