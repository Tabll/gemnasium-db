title: "Wasmtime segfault or unused out-of-sandbox load with f64.copysign operator
  on x86-64"
description: "On x86-64 platforms with AVX Wasmtime's compilation of the `f64.copysign`
  WebAssembly instruction with Cranelift may load 8 more bytes than is necessary.
  When [signals-based-traps] are disabled this can result in a uncaught segfault due
  to loading from unmapped guard pages. With guard pages disabled it's possible for
  out-of-sandbox data to be loaded, but unless there is another bug in Cranelift this
  data is not visible to WebAssembly guests."
