title: "wasmtime_trap_code C API function has out of bounds write vulnerability"
description: "There is a bug in Wasmtime's C API implementation where the definition
  of the `wasmtime_trap_code` does not match its declared signature in the `wasmtime/trap.h`
  header file. This discrepancy causes the function implementation to perform a 4-byte
  write into a 1-byte buffer provided by the caller. This can lead to three zero bytes
  being written beyond the 1-byte location provided by the caller."
