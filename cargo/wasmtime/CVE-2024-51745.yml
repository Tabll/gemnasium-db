title: "Wasmtime doesn't fully sandbox all the Windows device filenames"
description: "Wasmtime's filesystem sandbox implementation on Windows blocks access
  to special device filenames such as \"COM1\", \"COM2\", \"LPT0\", \"LPT1\", and
  so on, however it did not block access to the special device filenames which use
  superscript digits, such as \"COM¹\", \"COM²\", \"LPT⁰\", \"LPT¹\", and so on. Untrusted
  Wasm programs that are given access to any filesystem directory could bypass the
  sandbox and access devices through those special device filenames with superscript
  digits, and through them gain access peripheral devices connected to the computer,
  or network resources mapped to those devices. This can include modems, printers,
  network printers, and any other device connected to a serial or parallel port, including
  emulated USB serial ports."
