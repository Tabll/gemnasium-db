title: "Incorrect parsing of EVM reversion exit reason in RPC"
description: "A low severity security issue was discovered affecting parsing of the
  RPC result of the exit reason in case of EVM reversion. In release build, this would
  cause the exit reason being incorrectly parsed and returned by RPC. In debug build,
  this would cause an overflow panic.\n\nNo action is needed unless you have a bridge
  node that needs to distinguish different reversion exit reasons and you used RPC
  for this."
