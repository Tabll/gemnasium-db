title: "Stack overflow when parsing specially crafted JSON ABI strings"
description: "Affected versions of the `alloy-json-abi` crate did not properly handle
  parsing of malformatted JSON ABI strings. The `JsonAbi::parse` method can be tricked
  into a stack overflow when processing specially crafted input.\n\nThis stack overflow
  can lead to a crash of the application using this crate, potentially causing a denial
  of service.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in commit [4790c47](https://github.com/alloy-rs/core/commit/4790c47518024bd391bbd6815b00f501bad76a15)."
