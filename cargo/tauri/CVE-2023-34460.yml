title: "Tauri vulnerable to Regression on Filesystem Scope Checks for Dotfiles"
description: "The 1.4.0 release includes a regression on the filesystem scope check
  for dotfiles on Linux and macOS.\n\nPreviously dotfiles (eg. `$HOME/.ssh/`) were
  not implicitly allowed by the glob wildcard scopes (eg. `$HOME/*`), but a regression
  was introduced when a configuration option for this behavior was implemented and
  dotfiles were implicitly allowed.\n\nOnly Tauri applications using wildcard scopes
  in the `fs` endpoint are affected.\nOnly macOS and Linux systems are affected."
