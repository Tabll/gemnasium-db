title: "Tauri Filesystem Scope Glob Pattern is too Permissive"
description: "The filesystem glob pattern wildcards `*`, `?`, and `[...]` match file
  path literals and leading dots by default, which unintentionally exposes sub folder
  content of allowed paths.\n\nExample: The `fs` scope `$HOME/*.key` would also allow
  `$HOME/.ssh/secret.key` to be read even though it is in a sub directory of `$HOME`
  and is inside a hidden folder.\n\nScopes without the wildcards are not affected.
  As `**` allows for sub directories the behavior there is also as expected."
