title: "Tauri's readDir Endpoint Scope can be Bypassed With Symbolic Links"
description: "Due to missing canonicalization when `readDir` is called recursively,
  it was possible to display directory listings outside of the defined `fs` scope.
  This required a crafted symbolic link or junction folder inside an allowed path
  of the `fs` scope. No arbitrary file content could be leaked."
