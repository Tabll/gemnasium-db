title: "Tauri Filesystem Scope can be Partially Bypassed"
description: "Due to incorrect escaping of special characters in paths selected via
  the file dialog and drag and drop functionality, it was possible to partially bypass
  the `fs` scope definition. It was not possible to traverse into arbitrary paths,
  as the issue was limited to neighboring files and sub folders of already allowed
  paths.\n\nThe impact differs on Windows, MacOS and Linux due to different specifications
  of valid path characters.\n\nOn Linux or MacOS based systems it was possible to
  use the `*`, `**` and `[a-Z]` patterns inside a path, which allowed to read the
  content of sub directories and single character files in a folder, where only specific
  files or the directory itself were allowed.\n\nOn Windows `[a-Z]` was the possible
  bypass pattern, as `*` is not treated as a valid path component. This implies that
  only single character files inside an already allowed directory were unintentionally
  accessible.\n\nThis bypass depends on the file picker dialog or dragged files, as
  user selected paths are automatically added to the allow list at runtime.\n\nA successful
  bypass requires the user to select a pre-existing malicious file or directory during
  the file picker dialog and an adversary controlled logic to access these files.
  This means the issue by itself can not be abused and requires further intentional
  or unintentional privileges."
