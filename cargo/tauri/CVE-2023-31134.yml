title: "Tauri Open Redirect Vulnerability Possibly Exposes IPC to External Sites"
description: "The Tauri IPC is usually strictly isolated from external websites but
  the isolation can be bypassed by redirecting an existing Tauri window to an external
  website. This is either possible by an application implementing a feature for users
  to visit arbitrary websites or due to a bug allowing the open redirect[^open-redirect].\n\nThis
  allows the external website access to the IPC layer and therefore to all configured
  and exposed Tauri API endpoints and application specific implemented Tauri commands."
