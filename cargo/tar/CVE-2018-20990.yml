package_slug: "cargo/tar"
title: "Arbitrary file overwrite in tar-rs"
description: "When unpacking a tarball with the unpack_in-family of functions it's
  intended that only files within the specified directory are able to be written.
  Tarballs with hard links or symlinks, however, can be used to overwrite any file
  on the filesystem. Tarballs can contain multiple entries for the same file. A tarball
  which first contains an entry for a hard link or symlink pointing to any file on
  the filesystem will have the link created, and then afterwards if the same file
  is listed in the tarball the hard link will be rewritten and any file can be rewritten
  on the filesystem."
