title: "Clatter has a PSK Validity Rule Violation issue"
description: "Protocol compliance vulnerability. The library allowed post-quantum
  handshake patterns that violated the PSK validity rule (Noise Protocol Framework
  Section 9.3). This could allow PSK-derived keys to be used for encryption without
  proper randomization by self-chosen ephemeral randomness, weakening security guarantees
  and potentially allowing catastrophic key reuse.\n\nAffected default patterns include
  `noise_pqkk_psk0`, `noise_pqkn_psk0`, `noise_pqnk_psk0`, `noise_pqnn_psk0`, and
  some hybrid variants. Users of these patterns may have been using handshakes that
  do not meet the intended security properties."
