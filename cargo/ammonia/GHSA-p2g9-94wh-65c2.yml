title: "Space bug in `clean_text`"
description: "An incorrect mapping from HTML specification to ASCII codes was used.\nBecause
  HTML treats the Form Feed as whitespace, code like this has an injection bug:\n\nlet
  html = format!(\"<div title={}>\", clean_text(user_supplied_string));\n\nApplications
  are not affected if they quote their attributes, or if they don't use `clean_text`
  at all."
