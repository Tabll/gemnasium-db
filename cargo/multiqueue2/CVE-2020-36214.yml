package_slug: "cargo/multiqueue2"
title: "Data races in multiqueue2"
description: "Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implemented Send for
  types used in queue implementations (InnerSend<RW, T>, InnerRecv<RW, T>, FutInnerSend<RW,
  T>, FutInnerRecv<RW, T>).\n\nThis allows users to send non-Send types to other threads,
  which can lead to data race bugs or other undefined behavior.\n\nThe flaw was corrected
  in v0.1.7 by adding T: Send bound to to the Send impl of four data types explained
  above."
