package_slug: "cargo/signal-simple"
title: "Data races in signal-simple"
description: "Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implement Send/Sync
  for SyncChannel<T>. SyncChannel<T> doesn't provide access to &T but merely serves
  as a channel that consumes and returns owned T.\n\nUsers can create UB in safe Rust
  by sending T: !Send to other threads with SyncChannel::send/recv APIs. Using T =
  Arc<Cell<_> allows to create data races (which can lead to memory corruption), and
  using T = MutexGuard<T> allows to unlock a mutex from a thread that didn't lock
  the mutex."
