title: "SyncChannel<T> can move 'T: !Send' to other threads"
description: "Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implement Send/Sync
  for `SyncChannel<T>`. `SyncChannel<T>` doesn't provide access to `&T` but merely
  serves as a channel that consumes and returns owned `T`. Users can create UB in
  safe Rust by sending `T: !Send` to other threads with `SyncChannel::send/recv` APIs.
  Using `T = Arc<Cell<_>` allows to create data races (which can lead to memory corruption),
  and using `T = MutexGuard<T>` allows to unlock a mutex from a thread that didn't
  lock the mutex."
