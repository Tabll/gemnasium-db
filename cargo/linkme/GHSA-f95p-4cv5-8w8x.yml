title: "linkme fails to ensure slice elements match the slice's declared type"
description: "Affected versions allow populating a DistributedSlice of T with elements
  of an arbitrary other type that coerces to T. For example, elements of type `&&str`
  could end up in a slice of type `[&str]`, since `&&str` coerces to `&str` via a
  deref coercion.\n\nThe flaw was corrected by implementing typechecking for distributed
  slice elements in such a way that coercion no longer occurs. The element's type
  must be a subtype of the slice's declared element type."
