title: "Improper Digest Verification in httpsig-hyper May Allow Message Integrity
  Bypass"
description: "An issue was discovered in `httpsig-hyper` where Digest header verification
  could incorrectly succeed due to misuse of Rust's `matches!` macro. Specifically,
  the comparison:\n\n```rust\nif matches!(digest, _expected_digest)\n```\n\ntreated
  `_expected_digest` as a pattern binding rather than a value comparison, resulting
  in unconditional success of the match expression.\n\nAs a consequence, digest verification
  could incorrectly return success even when the computed digest did not match the
  expected value.\n\nApplications relying on Digest verification as part of HTTP message
  signature validation may therefore fail to detect message body modification. The
  severity depends on how the library is integrated and whether additional signature
  validation layers are enforced.\n\n---"
