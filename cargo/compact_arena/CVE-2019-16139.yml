package_slug: "cargo/compact_arena"
title: "Out of bounds access in compact_arena"
description: "Affected versions of this crate did not properly implement the generativity,
  because the invariant lifetimes were not necessarily dropped.\n\nThis allows an
  attacker to mix up two arenas, using indices created from one arena with another
  one. This might lead to an out-of-bounds read or write access into the memory reserved
  for the arena.\n\nThe flaw was corrected by implementing generativity correctly
  in version 0.4.0."
