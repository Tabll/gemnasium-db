package_slug: "cargo/openssl"
title: "rust-openssl ssl::select_next_proto use after free"
description: "`ssl::select_next_proto` can return a slice pointing into the `server`
  argument's buffer but with a lifetime bound to the `client` argument. In situations
  where the `server` buffer's lifetime is shorter than the `client` buffer's, this
  can cause a use after free. This could cause the server to crash or to return arbitrary
  memory contents to the client."
