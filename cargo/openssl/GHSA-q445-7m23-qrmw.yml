title: "openssl's `MemBio::get_buf` has undefined behavior with empty buffers"
description: "Previously, `MemBio::get_buf` called `slice::from_raw_parts` with a
  null-pointer, which violates the functions invariants, leading to undefined behavior.
  In debug builds this would produce an assertion failure. This is now fixed."
