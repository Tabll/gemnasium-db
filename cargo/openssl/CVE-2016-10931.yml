package_slug: "cargo/openssl"
title: "Improper Certificate Validation in openssl"
description: "All versions of rust-openssl prior to 0.9.0 contained numerous insecure
  defaults including off-by-default certificate verification and no API to perform
  hostname verification. Unless configured correctly by a developer, these defaults
  could allow an attacker to perform man-in-the-middle attacks. The problem was addressed
  in newer versions by enabling certificate verification by default and exposing APIs
  to perform hostname verification. Use the SslConnector and SslAcceptor types to
  take advantage of these new features (as opposed to the lower-level SslContext type)."
