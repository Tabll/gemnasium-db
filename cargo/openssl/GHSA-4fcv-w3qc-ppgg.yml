title: "rust-openssl Use-After-Free in `Md::fetch` and `Cipher::fetch`"
description: "When a `Some(...)` value was passed to the `properties` argument of
  either of these functions, a use-after-free would result.\n\nIn practice this would
  nearly always result in OpenSSL treating the properties as an empty string (due
  to `CString::drop`'s behavior).\n\nThe maintainers thank [quitbug](https://github.com/quitbug/)
  for reporting this vulnerability to us."
