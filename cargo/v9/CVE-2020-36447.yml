package_slug: "cargo/v9"
title: "Data race in v9"
description: "Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implement Sync for SyncRef<T>.
  This definition allows data races if &T is accessible through &SyncRef.\n\nSyncRef<T>
  derives Clone and Debug, and the default implementations of those traits access
  &T by invoking T::clone() & T::fmt(). It is possible to create data races & undefined
  behavior by concurrently invoking SyncRef<T>::clone() or SyncRef<T>::fmt() from
  multiple threads with T: !Sync."
