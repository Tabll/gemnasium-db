title: "Data races in v9"
description: "Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implement `Sync` for
  `SyncRef<T>`. This definition allows data races if `&T` is accessible through `&SyncRef`.\n\n`SyncRef<T>`
  derives `Clone` and `Debug`, and the default implementations of those traits access
  `&T` by invoking `T::clone()` & `T::fmt()`. It is possible to create data races
  & undefined behavior by concurrently invoking `SyncRef<T>::clone()` or `SyncRef<T>::fmt()`
  from multiple threads with `T: !Sync`."
