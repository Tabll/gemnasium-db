package_slug: "pypi/freeipa"
title: "Code injection in FreeIPA"
description: "A flaw was found in IPA, all 4.6.x versions before 4.6.7, all 4.7.x
  versions before 4.7.4 and all 4.8.x versions before 4.8.3, in the way the internal
  function ber_scanf() was used in some components of the IPA server, which parsed
  kerberos key data. An unauthenticated attacker who could trigger parsing of the
  krb principal key could cause the IPA server to crash or in some conditions, cause
  arbitrary code to be executed on the server hosting the IPA server."
