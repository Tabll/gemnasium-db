title: "yt-dlp Generic Extractor MITM Vulnerability via Arbitrary Proxy Injection"
description: "yt-dlp is a youtube-dl fork with additional features and fixes. The
  Generic Extractor in yt-dlp is vulnerable to an attacker setting an arbitrary proxy
  for a request to an arbitrary url, allowing the attacker to MITM the request made
  from yt-dlp's HTTP session. This could lead to cookie exfiltration in some cases.
  Version 2023.11.14 removed the ability to smuggle `http_headers` to the Generic
  extractor, as well as other extractors that use the same pattern. Users are advised
  to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable the Ggneric extractor (or only
  pass trusted sites with trusted content) and ake caution when using `--no-check-certificate`."
