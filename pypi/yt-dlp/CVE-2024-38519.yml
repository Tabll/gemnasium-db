package_slug: "pypi/yt-dlp"
title: "yt-dlp File system modification and RCE through improper file-extension sanitization"
description: "`yt-dlp` does not limit the extensions of downloaded files, which could
  lead to arbitrary filenames being created in the download folder (and path traversal
  on Windows). Since `yt-dlp` also reads config from the working directory (and on
  Windows executables will be executed from the yt-dlp directory) this could lead
  to arbitrary code being executed."
