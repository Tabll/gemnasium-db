package_slug: "pypi/yt-dlp"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command
  Injection')"
description: "yt-dlp is a youtube-dl fork with additional features and fixes. yt-dlp
  allows the user to provide shell command lines to be executed at various stages
  in its download steps through the `--exec` flag. This flag allows output template
  expansion in its argument, so that metadata values may be used in the shell commands.
  The metadata fields can be combined with the `%q` conversion, which is intended
  to quote/escape these values so they can be safely passed to the shell. However,
  the escaping used for `cmd` (the shell used by Python's `subprocess` on Windows)
  does not properly escape special characters, which can allow for remote code execution
  if `--exec` is used directly with maliciously crafted remote data. This vulnerability
  only impacts `yt-dlp` on Windows, and the vulnerability is present regardless of
  whether `yt-dlp` is run from `cmd` or from `PowerShell`. Support for output template
  expansion in `--exec`, along with this vulnerable behavior, was added to `yt-dlp`
  in version 2021.04.11. yt-dlp version 2023.09.24 fixes this issue by properly escaping
  each special character. `\\n` will be replaced by `\\r` as no way of escaping it
  has been found. It is recommended to upgrade yt-dlp to version 2023.09.24 as soon
  as possible. Also, always be careful when using --exec, because while this specific
  vulnerability has been patched, using unvalidated input in shell commands is inherently
  dangerous. For Windows users who are not able to upgrade: 1. Avoid using any output
  template expansion in --exec other than {} (filepath). 2. If expansion in --exec
  is needed, verify the fields you are using do not contain \", | or &. 3. Instead
  of using --exec, write the info json and load the fields from it instead.\n"
