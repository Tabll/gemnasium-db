title: "yt-dlp has dependency on potentially malicious third-party code in Douyu extractors"
description: "yt-dlp's DouyuTV and DouyuShow extractors used a `cdn.bootcdn.net` URL
  as a fallback for fetching a component of the crypto-js JavaScript library. When
  the Douyu extractor is used, yt-dlp extracts this JavaScript code and attempts to
  execute it externally using [PhantomJS](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs). `bootcdn.net`
  is owned by the bad actor responsible for the [Polyfill JS supply chain attack](https://sansec.io/research/polyfill-supply-chain-attack)
  that has been ongoing since at least June 2023. While there is no evidence that
  PhantomJS has been targeted by or is vulnerable to any attacks carried out by the
  Polyfill JS actor, there is the possibility that malicious JavaScript code may have
  been downloaded/cached by yt-dlp or executed by PhantomJS.\n\nIn order for this
  potential vulnerability to be exploited by any hypothetical attack, all 3 of the
  following conditions must be met:\n1. The user has PhantomJS installed on their
  system.\n2. The user passes a `douyu.com` or `douyutv.com` URL to yt-dlp as input,
  or passes a URL that redirects to one of these domains.\n3. `cdnjs.cloudflare.com`
  is unavailable or blocked at the time of extraction, necessitating the usage of
  the `cdn.bootcdn.net` fallback; or it had been unavailable during a previous run
  of the Douyu extractor and JavaScript code from `cdn.bootcdn.net` had been cached
  to disk."
