package_slug: "pypi/oauthenticator"
title: "GoogleOAuthenticator.hosted_domain incorrectly verifies membership of an Google
  organization/workspace"
description: "[`GoogleOAuthenticator.hosted_domain`] is used to restrict what Google
  accounts can be authorized to access a JupyterHub. The restriction _is intended_
  to ensure Google accounts are part of one or more Google organizations/workspaces
  verified to control specified domain(s).\n\nThe vulnerability is that the actual
  restriction has been to Google accounts with emails ending with the domain. Such
  accounts could have been created by anyone which at one time was able to read an
  email associated with the domain. This was described by Dylan Ayrey (@dxa4481) in
  this [blog post] from 15th December 2023."
