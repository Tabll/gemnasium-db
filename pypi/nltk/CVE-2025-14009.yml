title: "NLTK has a Zip Slip Vulnerability"
description: "A critical vulnerability exists in the NLTK downloader component of
  nltk/nltk, affecting all versions. The _unzip_iter function in nltk/downloader.py
  uses zipfile.extractall() without performing path validation or security checks.
  This allows attackers to craft malicious zip packages that, when downloaded and
  extracted by NLTK, can execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability arises because
  NLTK assumes all downloaded packages are trusted and extracts them without validation.
  If a malicious package contains Python files, such as __init__.py, these files are
  executed automatically upon import, leading to remote code execution. This issue
  can result in full system compromise, including file system access, network access,
  and potential persistence mechanisms."
