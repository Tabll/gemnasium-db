package_slug: "pypi/ubi-reader"
title: "Relative Path Traversal"
description: "ubireader_extract_files is vulnerable to path traversal when run against
  specifically crafted UBIFS files, allowing the attacker to overwrite files outside
  of the extraction directory (provided the process has write access to that file
  or directory). This is due to the fact that a node name (dent_node.name) is considered
  trusted and joined to the extraction directory path during processing, then the
  node content is written to that joined path. By crafting a malicious UBIFS file
  with node names holding path traversal payloads (e.g. ../../tmp/outside.txt), it's
  possible to force ubi_reader to write outside of the extraction directory. This
  issue affects ubi-reader before 0.8.5."
