title: "MS SWIFT Remote Code Execution via unsafe PyYAML deserialization"
description: "A Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in the [modelscope/ms-swift](https://github.com/modelscope/ms-swift)
  project due to unsafe use of `yaml.load()` in combination with vulnerable versions
  of the PyYAML library (≤ 5.3.1). The issue resides in the `tests/run.py` script,
  where a user-supplied YAML configuration file is deserialized using `yaml.load()`
  with `yaml.FullLoader`.\n\nIf an attacker can control or replace the YAML configuration
  file provided to the `--run_config` argument, they may inject a malicious payload
  that results in arbitrary code execution."
