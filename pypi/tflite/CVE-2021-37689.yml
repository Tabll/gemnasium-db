package_slug: "pypi/tflite"
title: "NULL Pointer Dereference"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  In affected versions an attacker can craft a TFLite model that would trigger a null
  pointer dereference, which would result in a crash and denial of service. This is
  caused by the MLIR optimization of `L2NormalizeReduceAxis` operator. The implementation
  unconditionally dereferences a pointer to an iterator to a vector without checking
  that the vector has elements."
