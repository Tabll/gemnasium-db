title: "multicast in source builds from vulnerable setuptools dependency"
description: "* Some source-builds may be impacted by a CWE-1395 (eg. vulnerable `setuptools`
  dependency).\n* Multicast prior to v2.0.9a3 on systems with minimal dependancies
  installed may use `setuptools <78.1.1` and thus rely on a compromised dependency.
  In some cases there is a chance that source-builds would fail due to an exploit
  of the closely related CVE-2025-47273, or become arbitrarily modified."
