package_slug: "pypi/jupyter-server"
title: "Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File"
description: "The Jupyter Server provides the backend (i.e. the core services, APIs,
  and REST endpoints) for Jupyter web applications. Prior to version 1.15.4, unauthorized
  actors can access sensitive information from server logs. Anytime a 5xx error is
  triggered, the auth cookie and other header values are recorded in Jupyter Server
  logs by default. Considering these logs do not require root access, an attacker
  can monitor these logs, steal sensitive auth/cookie information, and gain access
  to the Jupyter server. Jupyter Server version 1.15.4 contains a patch for this issue.
  There are currently no known workarounds."
