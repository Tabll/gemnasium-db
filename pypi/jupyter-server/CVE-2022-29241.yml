package_slug: "pypi/jupyter-server"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "Jupyter Server provides the backend (i.e. the core services, APIs, and
  REST endpoints) for Jupyter web applications like Jupyter Notebook. Prior to version
  1.17.1, if notebook server is started with a value of `root_dir` that contains the
  starting user's home directory, then the underlying REST API can be used to leak
  the access token assigned at start time by guessing/brute forcing the PID of the
  jupyter server. While this requires an authenticated user session, this URL can
  be used from a cross-site scripting payload or from a hooked or otherwise compromised
  browser to leak this access token to a malicious third party. This token can be
  used along with the REST API to interact with Jupyter services/notebooks such as
  modifying or overwriting critical files, such as .bashrc or .ssh/authorized_keys,
  allowing a malicious user to read potentially sensitive data and possibly gain control
  of the impacted system. This issue is patched in version 1.17.1."
