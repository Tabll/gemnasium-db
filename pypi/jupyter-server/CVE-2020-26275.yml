title: "Jupyter Server open redirect vulnerability"
description: "_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nOpen redirect
  vulnerability - a maliciously crafted link to a jupyter server could redirect the
  browser to a different website.\n\nAll jupyter servers running without a base_url
  prefix are technically affected, however, these maliciously crafted links can only
  be reasonably made for known jupyter server hosts. A link to your jupyter server
  may *appear* safe, but ultimately redirect to a spoofed server on the public internet.
  This same vulnerability was patched in upstream notebook v5.7.8."
