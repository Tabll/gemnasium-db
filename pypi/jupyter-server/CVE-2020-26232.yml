title: "URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')"
description: "Jupyter Server has an Open redirect vulnerability. A maliciously crafted
  link to a jupyter server could redirect the browser to a different website. All
  jupyter servers are technically affected, however, these maliciously crafted links
  can only be reasonably made for known jupyter server hosts. A link to your jupyter
  server may appear safe, but ultimately redirect to a spoofed server on the public
  internet."
