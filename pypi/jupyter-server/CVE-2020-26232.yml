title: "Open redirect in Jupyter Server"
description: "_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nOpen redirect
  vulnerability - a maliciously crafted link to a jupyter server could redirect the
  browser to a different website.\n\nAll jupyter servers are technically affected,
  however, these maliciously crafted links can only be reasonably made for known jupyter
  server hosts. A link to your jupyter server may *appear* safe, but ultimately redirect
  to a spoofed server on the public internet.\n\nThis originated in jupyter/notebook:
