package_slug: "pypi/scancodeio"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "ScanCode.io is a server to script and automate software composition
  analysis pipelines. In the `/license/` endpoint, the detailed view key is not properly
  validated and sanitized, which can result in a potential cross-site scripting (XSS)
  vulnerability when attempting to access a detailed license view that does not exist.
  Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to inject malicious scripts into the response
  generated by the `license_details_view` function. When unsuspecting users visit
  the page, their browsers will execute the injected scripts, leading to unauthorized
  actions, session hijacking, or stealing sensitive information. This issue has been
  addressed in release `32.5.2`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
  workarounds for this vulnerability."
