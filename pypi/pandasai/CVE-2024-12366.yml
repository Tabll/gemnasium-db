title: "PandasAI interactive prompt function Remote Code Execution (RCE)"
description: "PandasAI uses an interactive prompt function that is vulnerable to prompt
  injection and run arbitrary Python code that can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  instead of the intended explanation of the natural language processing by the LLM.
  The security controls of PandasAI (2.4.3 and earlier) fail to distinguish between
  legitimate and malicious inputs, allowing the attackers to manipulate the system
  into executing untrusted code, leading to untrusted code execution (RCE), system
  compromise, or pivoting attacks on connected services."
