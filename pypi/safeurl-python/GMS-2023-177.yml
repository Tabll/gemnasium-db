title: "Permissive regex leads to domain filter bypass"
description: "### Description\nIn SafeURL it is possible to specify a list of domains
  that should be matched before a request is sent out. The regex used to compare domains
  does not work as intended.\n\n### Impact\nThe regex used was:\n\n`re.match(\"(?i)^%s\"
  % domain, value)`\n\nThis has two problems, first that only the beginning and not
  the end of the string is anchored. Second, that a dot in the domain matches any
  character as part of regex syntax.\n\nTherefore, an allowlist of [\"victim.com\"]
  could allow the domain \"victimacomattacker.com\" to be requested.\n\nThis has lower
  impact since the usual attacker aim in an SSRF is to request internal resources
  such as private IP addresses rather than an attacker's own domain. But, in a case
  where SafeURL had specifically been used to try to limit requests to a particular
  allowlist, say for example a PDF renderer, the finding would be more severe.\n\n###
