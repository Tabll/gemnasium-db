title: "SafeURL-Python's hostname blocklist does not block FQDNs"
description: "### Description\nIf a hostname was block listed, it was possible to
  bypass the block list by requesting the FQDN of the host (e.g. adding `.` to the
  end).\n\n### Impact\nThe main purpose of this library is to block requests to internal/private
  IPs and these cannot be bypassed using this finding. But if a library user had specifically
  set certain hostnames as blocked, then an attacker would be able to circumvent that
  block to cause SSRFs to request those hostnames.\n\n### Patches\nFixed by https://github.com/IncludeSecurity/safeurl-python/pull/6\n\n###
