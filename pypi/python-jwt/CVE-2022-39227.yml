title: "Authentication Bypass by Spoofing"
description: "python-jwt is a module for generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens.
  Versions prior to 3.3.4 are subject to Authentication Bypass by Spoofing, resulting
  in identity spoofing, session hijacking or authentication bypass. An attacker who
  obtains a JWT can arbitrarily forge its contents without knowing the secret key.
  Depending on the application, this may for example enable the attacker to spoof
  other user's identities, hijack their sessions, or bypass authentication. Users
  should upgrade to version 3.3.4. There are no known workarounds."
