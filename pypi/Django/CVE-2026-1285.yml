package_slug: "pypi/Django"
title: "Django has Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity"
description: "An issue was discovered in 6.0 before 6.0.2, 5.2 before 5.2.11, and
  4.2 before 4.2.28.\n\n`django.utils.text.Truncator.chars()` and `Truncator.words()`
  methods (with `html=True`) and the `truncatechars_html` and `truncatewords_html`
  template filters allow a remote attacker to cause a potential denial-of-service
  via crafted inputs containing a large number of unmatched HTML end tags. Earlier,
  unsupported Django series (such as 5.0.x, 4.1.x, and 3.2.x) were not evaluated and
  may also be affected.\n\nDjango would like to thank Seokchan Yoon for reporting
  this issue."
