identifier: "CVE-2016-2512"
package_slug: "pypi/Django"
title: "Malicious redirect and possible XSS attack via user-supplied redirect URLs
  containing basic auth"
description: "Django relies on user input in some cases (e.g. `django.contrib.auth.views.login()`
  and i18n) to redirect the user to an \"on success\" URL. The security check for
  these redirects (namely `django.utils.http.is_safe_url()`) considered some URLs
  with basic authentication credentials \"safe\" when they shouldn't be. For example,
  a URL like `http://mysite.example.com\\@attacker.com` would be considered safe if
  the request's host is `http://mysite.example.com`, but redirecting to this URL sends
  the user to `attacker.com`. Also, if a developer relies on `is_safe_url()` to provide
  safe redirect targets and puts such a URL into a link, they could suffer from an
  XSS attack."
