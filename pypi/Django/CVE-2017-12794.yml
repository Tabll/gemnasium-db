package_slug: "pypi/Django"
title: "Possible XSS in traceback section of technical 500 debug page"
description: "HTML auto-escaping was disabled in a portion of the template for the
  technical debug page. Given the right circumstances, this allowed a cross-site scripting
  attack. This vulnerability shouldn't affect most production sites since you shouldn't
  run with `DEBUG = True` (which makes this page accessible) in your production settings."
