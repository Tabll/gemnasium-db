package_slug: "pypi/Django"
title: "Django vulnerable to XSS on 500 pages"
description: "In Django 1.10.x before 1.10.8 and 1.11.x before 1.11.5, HTML autoescaping
  was disabled in a portion of the template for the technical 500 debug page. Given
  the right circumstances, this allowed a cross-site scripting attack. This vulnerability
  shouldn't affect most production sites since you shouldn't run with `DEBUG = True`
  (which makes this page accessible) in your production settings."
