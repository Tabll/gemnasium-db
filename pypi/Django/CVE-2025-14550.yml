title: "Django has Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity"
description: "An issue was discovered in 6.0 before 6.0.2, 5.2 before 5.2.11, and
  4.2 before 4.2.28.\n\n`ASGIRequest` allows a remote attacker to cause a potential
  denial-of-service via a crafted request with multiple duplicate headers.\nEarlier,
  unsupported Django series (such as 5.0.x, 4.1.x, and 3.2.x) were not evaluated and
  may also be affected.\n\nDjango would like to thank Jiyong Yang for reporting this
  issue."
