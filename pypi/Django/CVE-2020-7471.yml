identifier: "CVE-2020-7471"
package_slug: "pypi/Django"
title: "SQL Injection"
description: "Django allows SQL Injection if untrusted data is used as a delimiter
  (e.g., in Django applications that offer downloads of data as a series of rows with
  a user-specified column delimiter). By passing a suitably crafted delimiter to a
  `contrib.postgres.aggregates.StringAgg` instance, it was possible to break escaping
  and inject malicious SQL."
