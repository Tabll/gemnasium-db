identifier: "CVE-2018-16984"
package_slug: "pypi/Django"
title: "Information Exposure"
description: "An issue was discovered in Django in which unprivileged users can read
  the password hashes of arbitrary accounts. The read-only password widget used by
  the Django Admin to display an obfuscated password hash was bypassed if a user has
  only the `view` permission, resulting in display of the entire password hash to
  those users. This may result in a vulnerability for sites with legacy user accounts
  using insecure hashes."
