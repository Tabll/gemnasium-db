title: "Django is vulnerable to DoS via XML serializer text extraction"
description: "An issue was discovered in 5.2 before 5.2.9, 5.1 before 5.1.15, and
  4.2 before 4.2.27.\nAlgorithmic complexity in `django.core.serializers.xml_serializer.getInnerText()`
  allows a remote attacker to cause a potential denial-of-service attack triggering
  CPU and memory exhaustion via specially crafted XML input processed by the XML `Deserializer`.\nEarlier,
  unsupported Django series (such as 5.0.x, 4.1.x, and 3.2.x) were not evaluated and
  may also be affected.\nDjango would like to thank Seokchan Yoon for reporting this
  issue."
