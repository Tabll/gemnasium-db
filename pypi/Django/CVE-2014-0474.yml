package_slug: "pypi/Django"
title: "MySQL typecasting"
description: "When using a MySQL database, Django don't perform explicit conversion
  of the fields: * FilePathField * GenericIPAddressField * IPAddressField If a query
  is performed without first converting values to the appropriate type, this can produce
  unexpected results, similar to what would occur if the query itself had been manipulated.
  An attacker can possibly use this issue to obtain unexpected results. "
