title: "Denial-of-service possibility in logout() view by filling session store"
description: "A session can be created when anonymously accessing the `django.contrib.auth.views.logout`
  view (provided it wasn't decorated with `django.contrib.auth.decorators.login_required`
  as done in the admin). This allows an attacker to easily create many new session
  records by sending repeated requests, potentially filling up the session store or
  causing other users' session records to be evicted."
