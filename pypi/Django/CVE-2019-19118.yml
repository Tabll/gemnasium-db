title: "Django allows unintended model editing"
description: "Django 2.1 before 2.1.15 and 2.2 before 2.2.8 allows unintended model
  editing. A Django model admin displaying inline related models, where the user has
  view-only permissions to a parent model but edit permissions to the inline model,
  would be presented with an editing UI, allowing POST requests, for updating the
  inline model. Directly editing the view-only parent model was not possible, but
  the parent model's save() method was called, triggering potential side effects,
  and causing pre and post-save signal handlers to be invoked. (To resolve this, the
  Django admin is adjusted to require edit permissions on the parent model in order
  for inline models to be editable.)"
