package_slug: "pypi/Django"
title: "Denial-of-service in Django"
description: "An issue was discovered in Django 2.2 before 2.2.26, 3.2 before 3.2.11,
  and 4.0 before 4.0.1. `UserAttributeSimilarityValidator` incurred significant overhead
  in evaluating a submitted password that was artificially large in relation to the
  comparison values. In a situation where access to user registration was unrestricted,
  this provided a potential vector for a denial-of-service attack."
