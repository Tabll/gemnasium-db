identifier: "CVE-2015-5144"
package_slug: "pypi/Django"
title: "Header injection via multi-lines input"
description: "Some built-in validators (django.core.validators.EmailValidator, most
  seriously) don't prohibit newline characters (due to the usage of $ instead of \\Z
  in the regular expressions). If you use values with newlines in HTTP response or
  email headers, you can suffer from header injection attacks."
