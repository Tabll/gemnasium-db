identifier: "CVE-2019-14234"
package_slug: "pypi/Django"
title: "SQL Injection"
description: "Due to an error in shallow key transformation, key and index lookups
  for `django.contrib.postgres.fields.JSONField`, and key lookups for `django.contrib.postgres.fields.HStoreField`,
  were subject to SQL injection. This could, for example, be exploited via crafted
  use of `OR 1=1` in a key or index name to return all records, using a suitably crafted
  dictionary, with dictionary expansion, as the `**kwargs` passed to the `QuerySet.filter()`
  function."
