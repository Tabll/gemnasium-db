title: "Django contains Uncontrolled Resource Consumption via cached header"
description: "In Django 3.2 before 3.2.17, 4.0 before 4.0.9, and 4.1 before 4.1.6,
  the parsed values of Accept-Language headers are cached in order to avoid repetitive
  parsing. This leads to a potential denial-of-service vector via excessive memory
  usage if the raw value of Accept-Language headers is very large."
