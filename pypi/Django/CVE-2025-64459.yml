title: "Django vulnerable to SQL injection via _connector keyword argument in QuerySet
  and Q objects."
description: "An issue was discovered in 5.1 before 5.1.14, 4.2 before 4.2.26, and
  5.2 before 5.2.8.\nThe methods `QuerySet.filter()`, `QuerySet.exclude()`, and `QuerySet.get()`,
  and the class `Q()`, are subject to SQL injection when using a suitably crafted
  dictionary, with dictionary expansion, as the `_connector` argument.\nEarlier, unsupported
  Django series (such as 5.0.x, 4.1.x, and 3.2.x) were not evaluated and may also
  be affected.\nDjango would like to thank cyberstan for reporting this issue."
