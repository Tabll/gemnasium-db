package_slug: "pypi/Django"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "In Django (with Python +), URLValidator does not prohibit newlines and
  tabs (unless the URLField form field is used). If an application uses values with
  newlines in an HTTP response, header injection can occur. Django itself is unaffected
  because HttpResponse prohibits newlines in HTTP headers."
