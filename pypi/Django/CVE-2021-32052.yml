package_slug: "pypi/Django"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "In Django  (with Python +), URLValidator does not prohibit newlines
  and tabs (unless the URLField form field is used). If an application uses values
  with newlines in an HTTP response, header injection can occur. Django itself is
  unaffected because HttpResponse prohibits newlines in HTTP headers."
