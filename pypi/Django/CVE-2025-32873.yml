title: "Django has a denial-of-service possibility in strip_tags()"
description: "An issue was discovered in Django 4.2 before 4.2.21, 5.1 before 5.1.9,
  and 5.2 before 5.2.1. The django.utils.html.strip_tags() function is vulnerable
  to a potential denial-of-service (slow performance) when processing inputs containing
  large sequences of incomplete HTML tags. The template filter striptags is also vulnerable,
  because it is built on top of strip_tags()."
