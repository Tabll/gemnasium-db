identifier: "CVE-2019-19844"
package_slug: "pypi/Django"
title: "Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password"
description: "Django allows account takeover. A suitably crafted email address (that
  is equal to an existing user's email address after case transformation of Unicode
  characters) would allow an attacker to be sent a password reset token for the matched
  user account. (One mitigation in the new releases is to send password reset tokens
  only to the registered user email address.)"
