package_slug: "pypi/Django"
title: "Django Potential account hijack via password reset form"
description: "Django before 1.11.27, 2.x before 2.2.9, and 3.x before 3.0.1 allows
  account takeover. A suitably crafted email address (that is equal to an existing
  user's email address after case transformation of Unicode characters) would allow
  an attacker to be sent a password reset token for the matched user account. (One
  mitigation in the new releases is to send password reset tokens only to the registered
  user email address.)"
