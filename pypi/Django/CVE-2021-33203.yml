- "CVE-2021-33203"
package_slug: "pypi/Django"
title: "Path Traversal"
description: "Django has a potential directory traversal via `django.contrib.admindocs`.
  Staff members could use the `TemplateDetailView` view to check the existence of
  arbitrary files. Additionally, if (and only if) the default admindocs templates
  have been customized by application developers to also show file contents, then
  not only the existence but also the file contents would have been exposed. In other
  words, there is directory traversal outside of the template root directories."
