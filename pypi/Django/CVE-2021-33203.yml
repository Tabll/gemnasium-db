identifier: "CVE-2021-33203"
package_slug: "pypi/Django"
title: "Path Traversal"
description: "Django has a potential directory traversal via `django.contrib.admindocs`.
  Staff members could use the `TemplateDetailView` view to check the existence of arbitrary
  files. Additionally, if (and only if) the default admindocs templates have been
  customized by application developers to also show file contents, then not only the
  existence but also the file contents would have been exposed. In other words, there
  is directory traversal outside of the template root directories."
