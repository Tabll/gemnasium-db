package_slug: "pypi/Django"
title: "Path Traversal in Django"
description: "Django before 2.2.24, 3.x before 3.1.12, and 3.2.x before 3.2.4 has
  a potential directory traversal via django.contrib.admindocs. Staff members could
  use the TemplateDetailView view to check the existence of arbitrary files. Additionally,
  if (and only if) the default admindocs templates have been customized by application
  developers to also show file contents, then not only the existence but also the
  file contents would have been exposed. In other words, there is directory traversal
  outside of the template root directories."
