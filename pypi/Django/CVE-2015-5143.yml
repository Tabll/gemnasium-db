identifier: "CVE-2015-5143"
package_slug: "pypi/Django"
title: "DOS by filling session store"
description: "The session backends created a new empty record in the session storage
  anytime request.session was accessed and there was a session key provided in the
  request cookies that didn't already have a session record. This could allow an attacker
  to easily create many new session records simply by sending repeated requests with
  unknown session keys, potentially filling up the session store or causing other
  users' session records to be evicted."
