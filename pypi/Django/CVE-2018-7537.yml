package_slug: "pypi/Django"
title: "Django Denial-of-service possibility in truncatechars_html and truncatewords_html
  template filters"
description: "An issue was discovered in Django 2.0 before 2.0.3, 1.11 before 1.11.11,
  and 1.8 before 1.8.19. If django.utils.text.Truncator's chars() and words() methods
  were passed the html=True argument, they were extremely slow to evaluate certain
  inputs due to a catastrophic backtracking vulnerability in a regular expression.
  The chars() and words() methods are used to implement the truncatechars_html and
  truncatewords_html template filters, which were thus vulnerable."
