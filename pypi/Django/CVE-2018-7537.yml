identifier: "CVE-2018-7537"
package_slug: "pypi/Django"
title: "Incorrect Regular Expression"
description: "If `django.utils.text.Truncator`'s `chars()` and `words()` methods were
  passed the `html=True` argument, they were extremely slow to evaluate certain inputs
  due to a catastrophic backtracking vulnerability in a regular expression. The `chars()`
  and words()` methods are used to implement the `truncatechars_html` and `truncatewords_html`
  template filters, which were thus vulnerable."
