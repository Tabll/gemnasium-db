package_slug: "pypi/Django"
title: "User enumeration through timing difference on password hasher work factor
  upgrade"
description: "In each major version of Django since, the default number of iterations
  for the PBKDF2PasswordHasher and its subclasses has increased. This improves the
  security of the password as the speed of hardware increases, however, it also creates
  a timing difference between a login request for a user with a password encoded in
  an older number of iterations and login request for a nonexistent user (which runs
  the default hasher's default number of iterations since Django ). This only affects
  users who haven't logged in since the iterations were increased. The first time
  a user logs in after an iterations increase, their password is updated with the
  new iterations and there is no longer a timing difference."
