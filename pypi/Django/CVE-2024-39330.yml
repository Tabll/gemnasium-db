package_slug: "pypi/Django"
title: "Django Path Traversal vulnerability"
description: "An issue was discovered in Django 5.0 before 5.0.7 and 4.2 before 4.2.14.
  Derived classes of the `django.core.files.storage.Storage` base class, when they
  override `generate_filename()` without replicating the file-path validations from
  the parent class, potentially allow directory traversal via certain inputs during
  a `save()` call. (Built-in Storage sub-classes are unaffected.)"
