identifier: "CVE-2017-7233"
package_slug: "pypi/Django"
title: "Open redirect and possible XSS attack via user-supplied numeric redirect URLs"
description: "Django relies on user input in some cases (e.g. `django.contrib.auth.views.login()`
  and i18n) to redirect the user to an \"on success\" URL. The security check for
  these redirects (namely `django.utils.http.is_safe_url()`) considered some numeric
  URLs (e.g. http:999999999) \"safe\" when they shouldn't be. Also, if a developer
  relies on `is_safe_url()` to provide safe redirect targets and puts such a URL into
  a link, they could suffer from an XSS attack."
