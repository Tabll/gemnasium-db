title: "Resource exhaustion in Django"
description: "An issue was discovered in the Multipart Request Parser in Django 3.2
  before 3.2.18, 4.0 before 4.0.10, and 4.1 before 4.1.7. Passing certain inputs (e.g.,
  an excessive number of parts) to multipart forms could result in too many open files
  or memory exhaustion, and provided a potential vector for a denial-of-service attack."
