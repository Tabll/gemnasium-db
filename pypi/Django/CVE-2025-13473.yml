package_slug: "pypi/Django"
title: "Django has Observable Timing Discrepancy"
description: "An issue was discovered in 6.0 before 6.0.2, 5.2 before 5.2.11, and
  4.2 before 4.2.28.\n\nThe `django.contrib.auth.handlers.modwsgi.check_password()`
  function for authentication via `mod_wsgi` allows remote attackers to enumerate
  users via a timing attack. Earlier, unsupported Django series (such as 5.0.x, 4.1.x,
  and 3.2.x) were not evaluated and may also be affected.\n\nDjango would like to
  thank Stackered for reporting this issue."
