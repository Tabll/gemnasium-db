title: "Django has an SQL Injection issue"
description: "An issue was discovered in 6.0 before 6.0.2, 5.2 before 5.2.11, and
  4.2 before 4.2.28.\n\n`FilteredRelation` is subject to SQL injection in column aliases
  via control characters, using a suitably crafted dictionary, with dictionary expansion,
  as the `**kwargs` passed to `QuerySet` methods `annotate()`, `aggregate()`, `extra()`,
  `values()`, `values_list()`, and `alias()`. Earlier, unsupported Django series (such
  as 5.0.x, 4.1.x, and 3.2.x) were not evaluated and may also be affected.\n\nDjango
  would like to thank Solomon Kebede for reporting this issue."
