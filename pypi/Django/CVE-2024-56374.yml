title: "Django has a potential denial-of-service vulnerability in IPv6 validation"
description: "An issue was discovered in Django 5.1 before 5.1.5, 5.0 before 5.0.11,
  and 4.2 before 4.2.18. Lack of upper-bound limit enforcement in strings passed when
  performing IPv6 validation could lead to a potential denial-of-service attack. The
  undocumented and private functions `clean_ipv6_address` and `is_valid_ipv6_address`
  are vulnerable, as is the `django.forms.GenericIPAddressField` form field. (The
  django.db.models.GenericIPAddressField model field is not affected.)"
