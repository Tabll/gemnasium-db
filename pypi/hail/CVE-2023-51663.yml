package_slug: "pypi/hail"
title: "Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name"
description: "Hail is an open-source, general-purpose, Python-based data analysis
  tool with additional data types and methods for working with genomic data. Hail
  relies on OpenID Connect (OIDC) email addresses from ID tokens to verify the validity
  of a user's domain, but because users have the ability to change their email address,
  they could create accounts and use resources in clusters that they should not have
  access to. For example, a user could create a Microsoft or Google account and then
  change their email to `test@example.org`. This account can then be used to create
  a Hail Batch account in Hail Batch clusters whose organization domain is `example.org`.
  The attacker is not able to access private data or impersonate another user, but
  they would have the ability to run jobs if Hail Batch billing projects are enabled
  and create Azure Tenants if they have Azure Active Directory Administrator access."
