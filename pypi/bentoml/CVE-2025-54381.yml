title: "BentoML SSRF Vulnerability in File Upload Processing  "
description: "There's an SSRF in the file upload processing system that allows remote
  attackers to make arbitrary HTTP requests from the server without authentication.
  The vulnerability exists in the serialization/deserialization handlers for multipart
  form data and JSON requests, which automatically download files from user-provided
  URLs without proper validation of internal network addresses.\n\nThe framework automatically
  registers any service endpoint with file-type parameters (`pathlib.Path`, `PIL.Image.Image`)
  as vulnerable to this attack, making it a framework-wide security issue that affects
  most real-world ML services handling file uploads. While BentoML implements basic
  URL scheme validation in the `JSONSerde` path, the `MultipartSerde` path has no
  validation whatsoever, and neither path restricts access to internal networks, cloud
  metadata endpoints, or localhost services.\n\nThe documentation explicitly promotes
  this URL-based file upload feature, making it an intended but insecure design that
  exposes all deployed services to SSRF attacks by default."
