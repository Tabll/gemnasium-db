title: "BentoML has a Path Traversal via Bentofile Configuration"
description: "BentoML's `bentofile.yaml` configuration allows path traversal attacks
  through multiple file path fields (`description`, `docker.setup_script`, `docker.dockerfile_template`,
  `conda.environment_yml`). An attacker can craft a malicious bentofile that, when
  built by a victim, exfiltrates arbitrary files from the filesystem into the bento
  archive. This enables supply chain attacks where sensitive files (SSH keys, credentials,
  environment variables) are silently embedded in bentos and exposed when pushed to
  registries or deployed."
