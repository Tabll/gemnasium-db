title: "Insecure deserialization in BentoML"
description: "An insecure deserialization vulnerability exists in the BentoML framework,
  allowing remote code execution (RCE) by sending a specially crafted POST request.
  By exploiting this vulnerability, attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the
  server hosting the BentoML application. The vulnerability is triggered when a serialized
  object, crafted to execute OS commands upon deserialization, is sent to any valid
  BentoML endpoint. This issue poses a significant security risk, enabling attackers
  to compromise the server and potentially gain unauthorized access or control."
