title: "BentoML vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "In bentoml/bentoml version 1.3.9, the `/login` endpoint of the newly
  integrated Gradio app is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. This vulnerability
  can be exploited by appending characters, such as dashes (-), to the end of a multipart
  boundary in an HTTP request. The server continuously processes each character, leading
  to excessive resource consumption and rendering the service unavailable. The issue
  is unauthenticated and does not require any user interaction."
