title: "BentoML Denial of Service (DoS) via Multipart Boundary"
description: "BentoML version v1.3.4post1 is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS)
  attack. The vulnerability can be exploited by appending characters, such as dashes
  (-), to the end of a multipart boundary in an HTTP request. This causes the server
  to continuously process each character, leading to excessive resource consumption
  and rendering the service unavailable. The issue is unauthenticated and does not
  require any user interaction, impacting all users of the service."
