title: "changedetection.io Vulnerable to Improper Input Validation Leading to LFR/Path
  Traversal"
description: "Improper input validation in the application can allow attackers to
  perform local file read (LFR) or path traversal attacks. These vulnerabilities occur
  when user input is used to construct file paths without adequate sanitization or
  validation. For example, using `file:../../../etc/passwd` or `file: ///etc/passwd`
  can bypass weak validations and allow unauthorized access to sensitive files. Even
  though this has been addressed in previous patch, it is still insufficient."
