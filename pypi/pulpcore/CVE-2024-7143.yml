title: "Pulp incorrectly assigns RBAC permissions in tasks that create objects"
description: "A flaw was found in the Pulp package. When a role-based access control
  (RBAC) object in Pulp is set to assign permissions on its creation, it uses the
  `AutoAddObjPermsMixin` (typically the add_roles_for_object_creator method). This
  method finds the object creator by checking the current authenticated user. For
  objects that are created within a task, this current user is set by the first user
  with any permissions on the task object. This means the oldest user with model/domain-level
  task permissions will always be set as the current user of a task, even if they
  didn't dispatch the task. Therefore, all objects created in tasks will have their
  permissions assigned to this oldest user, and the creating user will receive nothing."
