title: "Ray's New Token Authentication is Disabled By Default"
description: "Anyscale Ray 2.52.0 contains an insecure default configuration in which
  token-based authentication for Ray management interfaces (including the dashboard
  and Jobs API) is disabled unless explicitly enabled by setting RAY_AUTH_MODE=token.
  In the default unauthenticated state, a remote attacker with network access to these
  interfaces can submit jobs and execute arbitrary code on the Ray cluster. NOTE:
  The vendor plans to enable token authentication by default in a future release.
  They recommend enabling token authentication to protect your cluster from unauthorized
  access."
