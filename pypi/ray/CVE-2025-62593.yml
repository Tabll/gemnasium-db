title: "Ray is vulnerable to Critical RCE via Safari & Firefox Browsers through DNS
  Rebinding Attack"
description: "Developers working with Ray as a development tool can be exploited via
  a critical RCE vulnerability exploitable via Firefox and Safari.\n\nDue to the longstanding
  [decision](https://docs.ray.io/en/releases-2.51.1/ray-security/index.html) by the
  Ray Development team to not implement any sort of authentication on critical endpoints,
  like the `/api/jobs` & `/api/job_agent/jobs/` has once again led to a severe vulnerability
  that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code against Ray. This time in a development
  context via the browsers Firefox and Safari.\n\nThis vulnerability is due to an
  insufficient guard against browser-based attacks, as the current defense uses the
  `User-Agent` header starting with the string \"Mozilla\" as a defense mechanism.
  This defense is insufficient as the fetch specification allows the `User-Agent`
  header to be modified.\n\nCombined with a DNS rebinding attack against the browser,
  and this vulnerability is exploitable against a developer running Ray who inadvertently
  visits a malicious website, or is served a malicious advertisement ([malvertising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malvertising))."
