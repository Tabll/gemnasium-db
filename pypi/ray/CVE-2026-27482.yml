title: "Ray dashboard DELETE endpoints allow unauthenticated browser-triggered DoS
  (Serve shutdown / job deletion)"
description: "Ray’s dashboard HTTP server blocks browser-origin POST/PUT but does
  not cover DELETE, and key DELETE endpoints are unauthenticated by default. If the
  dashboard/agent is reachable (e.g., --dashboard-host=0.0.0.0), a web page via DNS
  rebinding or same-network access can\nissue DELETE requests that shut down Serve
  or delete jobs without user interaction. This is a drive-by availability impact."
