- "GHSA-72qw-p7hh-m3ff"
package_slug: "pypi/validators"
title: "Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity"
description: "Torbot is an open source tor network intelligence tool. In affected
  versions the `torbot.modules.validators.validate_link function` uses the python-validators
  URL validation regex. This particular regular expression has an exponential complexity
  which allows an attacker to cause an application crash using a well-crafted argument.
  An attacker can use a well-crafted URL argument to exploit the vulnerability in
  the regular expression and cause a Denial of Service on the system. The validators
  file has been removed in version 4.0.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are
  no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
