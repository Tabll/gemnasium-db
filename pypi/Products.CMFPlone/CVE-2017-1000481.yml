package_slug: "pypi/Products.CMFPlone"
title: "URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')"
description: "When you visit a page where you need to login, Plone 2.5-5.1rc1 sends
  you to the login form with a 'came_from' parameter set to the previous url. After
  you login, you get redirected to the page you tried to view before. An attacker
  might try to abuse this by letting you click on a specially crafted link. You would
  login, and get redirected to the site of the attacker, letting you think that you
  are still on the original Plone site. Or some javascript of the attacker could be
  executed. Most of these types of attacks are already blocked by Plone, using the
  `isURLInPortal` check to make sure we only redirect to a page on the same Plone
  site. But a few more ways of tricking Plone into accepting a malicious link were
  discovered, and fixed with this hotfix."
