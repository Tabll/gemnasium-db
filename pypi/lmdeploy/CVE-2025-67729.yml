title: "lmdeploy vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution via Insecure Deserialization
  in torch.load()"
description: "An insecure deserialization vulnerability exists in lmdeploy where `torch.load()`
  is called without the `weights_only=True` parameter when loading model checkpoint
  files. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine
  when they load a malicious `.bin` or `.pt` model file.\n\n\n**CWE:** CWE-502 - Deserialization
  of Untrusted Data\n\n---"
