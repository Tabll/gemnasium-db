title: "lunary-ai/lunary Access Control Vulnerability in Prompt Variation Management"
description: "In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.13, an insufficient granularity of access
  control vulnerability allows users to create, update, get, and delete prompt variations
  for datasets not owned by their organization. This issue arises due to the application
  not properly validating the ownership of dataset prompts and their variations against
  the organization or project of the requesting user. As a result, unauthorized modifications
  to dataset prompts can occur, leading to altered or removed dataset prompts without
  proper authorization. This vulnerability impacts the integrity and consistency of
  dataset information, potentially affecting the results of experiments."
