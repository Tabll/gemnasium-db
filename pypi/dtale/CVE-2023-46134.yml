title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command
  Injection')"
description: "D-Tale is the combination of a Flask back-end and a React front-end
  to view & analyze Pandas data structures. Prior to version 3.7.0, users hosting
  D-Tale publicly can be vulnerable to remote code execution, allowing attackers to
  run malicious code on the server. This issue has been patched in version 3.7.0 by
  turning off \"Custom Filter\" input by default. The only workaround for versions
  earlier than 3.7.0 is to only host D-Tale to trusted users.\n"
