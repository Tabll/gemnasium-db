package_slug: "pypi/dtale"
title: "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
description: "D-Tale is a visualizer for Pandas data structures. Users hosting versions
  D-Tale prior to 3.9.0 publicly can be vulnerable to server-side request forgery
  (SSRF), allowing attackers to access files on the server. Users should upgrade to
  version 3.9.0, where the `Load From the Web` input is turned off by default. The
  only workaround for versions earlier than 3.9.0 is to only host D-Tale to trusted
  users."
