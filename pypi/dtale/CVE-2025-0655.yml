description: "A vulnerability in man-group/dtale versions 3.15.1 allows an attacker
  to override global state settings to enable the `enable_custom_filters` feature,
  which is typically restricted to trusted environments. Once enabled, the attacker
  can exploit the /test-filter endpoint to execute arbitrary system commands, leading
  to remote code execution (RCE). This issue is addressed in version 3.16.1."
