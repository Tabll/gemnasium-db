title: "Authentication bypass in dtale"
description: "man-group/dtale version 3.10.0 is vulnerable to an authentication bypass
  and remote code execution (RCE) due to improper input validation. The vulnerability
  arises from a hardcoded `SECRET_KEY` in the flask configuration, allowing attackers
  to forge a session cookie if authentication is enabled. Additionally, the application
  fails to properly restrict custom filter queries, enabling attackers to execute
  arbitrary code on the server by bypassing the restriction on the `/update-settings`
  endpoint, even when `enable_custom_filters` is not enabled. This vulnerability allows
  attackers to bypass authentication mechanisms and execute remote code on the server."
