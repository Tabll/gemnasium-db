title: "ReDoS in py library when used with subversion "
description: "The py library through 1.11.0 for Python allows remote attackers to
  conduct a ReDoS (Regular expression Denial of Service) attack via a Subversion repository
  with crafted info data, because the InfoSvnCommand argument is mishandled.\n\nThe
  particular codepath in question is the regular expression at `py._path.svnurl.InfoSvnCommand.lspattern`
  and is only relevant when dealing with subversion (svn) projects. Notably the codepath
  is not used in the popular pytest project. The developers of the pytest package
  have released version `7.2.0` which removes their dependency on `py`. Users of `pytest`
  seeing alerts relating to this advisory may update to version `7.2.0` of `pytest`
  to resolve this issue. See https://github.com/pytest-dev/py/issues/287#issuecomment-1290407715
  for additional context."
