title: "NiceGUI has a Reflected XSS"
description: "A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) risk exists in NiceGUI when developers
  render unescaped user input into the DOM using `ui.html()`. Before version 3.0,
  NiceGUI does not enforce HTML or JavaScript sanitization, so applications that directly
  combine components like `ui.input()` with `ui.html()` without escaping may allow
  attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the userâ€™s browser. Same holds for
  `ui.chat_message` with HTML content.\n\nApplications that directly reflect user
  input via `ui.html()` (or `ui.chat_message` in HTML mode) are affected. This may
  lead to client-side code execution (e.g., session hijacking or phishing). Applications
  that do not pass untrusted input into ui.html() are not affected."
