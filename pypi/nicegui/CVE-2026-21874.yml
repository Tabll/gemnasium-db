title: "NiceGUI has Redis connection leak via tab storage causes service degradation"
description: "An unauthenticated attacker can exhaust Redis connections by repeatedly
  opening and closing browser tabs on any NiceGUI application using Redis-backed storage.
  Connections are never released, leading to service degradation when Redis hits its
  connection limit.\n**NiceGUI continues accepting new connections - errors are logged
  but the app stays up with broken storage functionality.**"
