title: "NiceGUI allows potential access to local file system"
description: "NiceGUI is an easy-to-use, Python-based UI framework. A local file inclusion
  is present in the NiceUI leaflet component when requesting resource files under
  the `/_nicegui/{__version__}/resources/{key}/{path:path}` route.\n\nAs a result
  any file on the backend filesystem which the web server has access to can be read
  by an attacker with access to the NiceUI leaflet website.\n\nThis vulnerability
  has been addressed in version 1.4.21. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no
  known workarounds for this vulnerability."
