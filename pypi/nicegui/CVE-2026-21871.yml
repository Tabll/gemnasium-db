title: "NiceGUI is vulnerable to XSS via Unescaped URL in ui.navigate.history.push()
  / replace()"
description: "XSS risk exists in NiceGUI when developers pass attacker-controlled
  strings into `ui.navigate.history.push()` or `ui.navigate.history.replace()`. These
  helpers are documented as History API wrappers for updating the browser URL without
  page reload. However, if the URL argument is embedded into generated JavaScript
  without proper escaping, a crafted payload can break out of the intended string
  context and execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim’s browser.\n\n**Applications
  that do not pass untrusted input into `ui.navigate.history.push/replace` are not
  affected.**"
