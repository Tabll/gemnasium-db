title: "NiceGUI's XSS vulnerability in ui.markdown() allows arbitrary JavaScript execution
  through unsanitized HTML content"
description: "The `ui.markdown()` component uses the `markdown2` library to convert
  markdown content to HTML, which is then rendered via `innerHTML`. By default, `markdown2`
  allows raw HTML to pass through unchanged. This means that if an application renders
  user-controlled content through `ui.markdown()`, an attacker can inject malicious
  HTML containing JavaScript event handlers.\n\nUnlike other NiceGUI components that
  render HTML (`ui.html()`, `ui.chat_message()`, `ui.interactive_image()`), the `ui.markdown()`
  component does not provide or require a `sanitize` parameter, leaving applications
  vulnerable to XSS attacks."
