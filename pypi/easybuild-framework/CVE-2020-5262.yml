title: "GitHub personal access token leaking into temporary EasyBuild (debug) logs"
description: "The GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) used by EasyBuild for the GitHub
  integration features (like `--new-pr`, `--from-pr`, etc.) is shown in plain text
  in EasyBuild debug log files.\n\nScope:\n\n* the log message only appears in the
  top-level log file, *not* in the individual software installation logs (see https://easybuild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Logfiles.html);\n-
  as a consequence, tokens are *not* included in the partial log files that are uploaded
  into a gist when using `--upload-test-report` in combination with `--from-pr`, nor
  in the installation logs that are copied to the software installation directories;\n*
  the message is only logged when using `--debug`, so it will not appear when using
  the default EasyBuild configuration (only info messages are logged by default);\n*
  the log message is triggered via `--from-pr`, but also via various other GitHub
  integration options like `--new-pr`, `--merge-pr`, `--close-pr`, etc., but usually
  only appears in the temporary log file that is cleaned up automatically as soon
  as eb completes successfully;\n* you may have several debug log files that include
  your GitHub token in `/tmp` (or a different location if you've set the `--tmpdir`
  EasyBuild configuration option) on the systems where you use EasyBuild, but they
  are located in a subdirectory that is only accessible to your account (permissions
  set to 700);\n* the only way that a log file that may include your token could have
  been made public is *if you shared it yourself*, for example by copying the contents
  of the log file into a gist manually, or by sending a log file to someone;\n* for
  log files uploaded to GitHub, your token would be revoked automatically when GitHub
  notices it;"
