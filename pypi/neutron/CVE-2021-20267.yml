title: "Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity"
description: "A flaw was found in openstack-neutron's default Open vSwitch firewall
  rules. By sending carefully crafted packets, anyone in control of a server instance
  connected to the virtual switch can impersonate the IPv6 addresses of other systems
  on the network, resulting in denial of service or in some cases possibly interception
  of traffic intended for other destinations."
