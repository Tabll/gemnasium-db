title: "Openstack Neutron has Insufficient Verification of IPv6 addresses"
description: "A flaw was found in openstack-neutron's default Open vSwitch firewall
  rules. By sending carefully crafted packets, anyone in control of a server instance
  connected to the virtual switch can impersonate the IPv6 addresses of other systems
  on the network, resulting in denial of service or in some cases possibly interception
  of traffic intended for other destinations. Only deployments using the Open vSwitch
  driver are affected. Source: OpenStack project. Versions before openstack-neutron
  15.3.3, openstack-neutron 16.3.1 and openstack-neutron 17.1.1 are affected."
