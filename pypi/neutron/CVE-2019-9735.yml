title: "OpenStack Neutron's unsupported dport option prevents applying security groups"
description: "An issue was discovered in the iptables firewall module in OpenStack
  Neutron before 10.0.8, 11.x before 11.0.7, 12.x before 12.0.6, and 13.x before 13.0.3.
  By setting a destination port in a security group rule along with a protocol that
  doesn't support that option (for example, VRRP), an authenticated user may block
  further application of security group rules for instances from any project/tenant
  on the compute hosts to which it's applied. (Only deployments using the iptables
  security group driver are affected.)"
