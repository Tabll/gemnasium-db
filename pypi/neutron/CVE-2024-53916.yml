title: "OpenStack Neutron can use an incorrect ID during policy enforcement"
description: "In OpenStack Neutron before 25.0.1, neutron/extensions/tagging.py can
  use an incorrect ID during policy enforcement. It does not apply the proper policy
  check for changing network tags. An unprivileged tenant is able to change (add and
  clear) tags on network objects that do not belong to the tenant, and this action
  is not subjected to the proper policy authorization check. This affects 23 before
  23.2.1, 24 before 24.0.2, and 25 before 25.0.1."
