package_slug: "pypi/neutron"
title: "Incorrect Authorization"
description: "OpenStack Neutron allows hardware address impersonation when the linuxbridge
  driver with ebtables-nft is used on a Netfilter-based platform. By sending carefully
  crafted packets, anyone in control of a server instance connected to the virtual
  switch can impersonate the hardware addresses of other systems on the network, resulting
  in denial of service or in some cases possibly interception of traffic intended
  for other destinations."
