title: "Openstack Neutron vulnerable to eavesdropping on private traffic"
description: "Live-migrated instances are briefly able to inspect traffic for other
  instances on the same hypervisor. This brief window could be extended indefinitely
  if the instance's port is set administratively down prior to live-migration and
  kept down after the migration is complete. This is possible due to the Open vSwitch
  integration bridge being connected to the instance during migration. When connected
  to the integration bridge, all traffic for instances using the same Open vSwitch
  instance would potentially be visible to the migrated guest, as the required Open
  vSwitch VLAN filters are only applied post-migration. Versions of openstack-neutron
  before 13.0.0.0b2, 12.0.3, 11.0.5 are vulnerable."
