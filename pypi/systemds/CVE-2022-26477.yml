title: "SystemDS CPU exhaustion vulnerability"
description: "The Security Team noticed that the termination condition of the for
  loop in the readExternal method is a controllable variable, which, if tampered with,
  may lead to CPU exhaustion. As a fix, we added an upper bound and termination condition
  in the read and write logic. We classify it as a \"low-priority but useful improvement\".
  SystemDS is a distributed system and needs to serialize/deserialize data but in
  many code paths (e.g., on Spark broadcast/shuffle or writing to sequence files)
  the byte stream is anyway protected by additional CRC fingerprints. In this particular
  case though, the number of decoders is upper-bounded by twice the number of columns,
  which means an attacker would need to modify two entries in the byte stream in a
  consistent manner. By adding these checks robustness was strictly improved with
  almost zero overhead. These code changes are available in versions higher than 2.2.1."
