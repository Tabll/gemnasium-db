title: "Workers for local Dask clusters mistakenly listened on public interfaces"
description: "Versions of `distributed` earlier than `2021.10.0` had a potential security
  vulnerability relating to single-machine Dask clusters.\n\nClusters started with
  `dask.distributed.LocalCluster` or `dask.distributed.Client()` (which defaults to
  using `LocalCluster`) would mistakenly configure their respective Dask workers to
  listen on external interfaces (typically with a randomly selected high port) rather
  than only on `localhost`. A Dask cluster created using this method AND running on
  a machine that has these ports exposed could be used by a sophisticated attacker
  to enable remote code execution. Users running on machines with standard firewalls
  in place, or using clusters created via cluster objects other than `LocalCluster`
  (e.g. `dask_kubernetes.KubeCluster`) should not be affected. This vulnerability
  is documented in CVE-2021-42343, and was fixed in version `2021.10.0` (PR #5427)."
