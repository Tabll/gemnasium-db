title: "vLLM has a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS, Exponential Complexity)
  Vulnerability in `pythonic_tool_parser.py`"
description: "A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists
  in the file [`vllm/entrypoints/openai/tool_parsers/pythonic_tool_parser.py`](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/main/vllm/entrypoints/openai/tool_parsers/pythonic_tool_parser.py)
  of the vLLM project. The root cause is the use of a highly complex and nested regular
  expression for tool call detection, which can be exploited by an attacker to cause
  severe performance degradation or make the service unavailable."
