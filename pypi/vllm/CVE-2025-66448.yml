title: "vLLM vulnerable to remote code execution via transformers_utils/get_config"
description: "`vllm` has a critical remote code execution vector in a config class
  named `Nemotron_Nano_VL_Config`. When `vllm` loads a model config that contains
  an `auto_map` entry, the config class resolves that mapping with `get_class_from_dynamic_module(...)`
  and immediately instantiates the returned class. This fetches and executes Python
  from the remote repository referenced in the `auto_map` string. Crucially, this
  happens even when the caller explicitly sets `trust_remote_code=False` in `vllm.transformers_utils.config.get_config`.
  In practice, an attacker can publish a benign-looking frontend repo whose `config.json`
  points via `auto_map` to a separate malicious backend repo; loading the frontend
  will silently run the backend’s code on the victim host."
