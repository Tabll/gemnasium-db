title: "vLLM Denial of Service via the best_of parameter"
description: "A vulnerability was found in the ilab model serve component, where improper
  handling of the best_of parameter in the vllm JSON web API can lead to a Denial
  of Service (DoS). The API used for LLM-based sentence or chat completion accepts
  a best_of parameter to return the best completion from several options. When this
  parameter is set to a large value, the API does not handle timeouts or resource
  exhaustion properly, allowing an attacker to cause a DoS by consuming excessive
  system resources. This leads to the API becoming unresponsive, preventing legitimate
  users from accessing the service."
