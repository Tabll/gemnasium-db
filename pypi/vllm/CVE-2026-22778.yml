title: "vLLM has RCE In Video Processing"
description: "**A chain of vulnerabilities in vLLM allow Remote Code Execution (RCE):**\n\n1.
  **Info Leak** - PIL error messages expose memory addresses, bypassing ASLR\n2. **Heap
  Overflow** - JPEG2000 decoder in OpenCV/FFmpeg has a heap overflow that lets us
  hijack code execution\n\n**Result:** Send a malicious video URL to vLLM Completions
  or Invocations **for a video model** -> Execute arbitrary commands on the server\n\nCompletely
  default vLLM instance directly from pip, or docker, does not have authentication
  so \"None\" privileges are required, but even with non-default api-key enabled configuration
  this exploit is feasible through invocations route that allows payload to execute
  pre-auth.\n\nExample heap target is provided, other heap targets can be exploited
  as well to achieve rce. Leak allows for simple ASLR bypass. Leak + heap overflow
  achieves RCE on versions prior to 0.14.1.\n\nDeployments not serving a video model
  are not affected.\n\n---"
