title: "vLLM Allows Remote Code Execution via PyNcclPipe Communication Service"
description: "vLLM supports the use of the `PyNcclPipe` class to establish a peer-to-peer
  communication domain for data transmission between distributed nodes. The GPU-side
  KV-Cache transmission is implemented through the `PyNcclCommunicator` class, while
  CPU-side control message passing is handled via the `send_obj` and `recv_obj` methods
  on the CPU side.​\n\nA remote code execution vulnerability exists in the `PyNcclPipe`
  service. Attackers can exploit this by sending malicious serialized data to gain
  server control privileges.\n\nThe intention was that this interface should only
  be exposed to a private network using the IP address specified by the `--kv-ip`
  CLI parameter. The vLLM documentation covers how this must be limited to a secured
  network: https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/deployment/security.html\n\nUnfortunately,
  the default behavior from PyTorch is that the `TCPStore` interface will listen on
  ALL interfaces, regardless of what IP address is provided. The IP address given
  was only used as a client-side address to use. vLLM was fixed to use a workaround
  to force the `TCPStore` instance to bind its socket to a specified private interface.\n\nThis
  issue was reported privately to PyTorch and they determined that this behavior was
  intentional."
