title: "vLLM deserialization vulnerability leading to DoS and potential RCE"
description: "A memory corruption vulnerability that leading to a crash (denial-of-service)
  and potentially remote code execution (RCE) exists in vLLM versions 0.10.2 and later,
  in the Completions API endpoint. When processing user-supplied prompt embeddings,
  the endpoint loads serialized tensors using torch.load() without sufficient validation.\n\nDue
  to a change introduced in PyTorch 2.8.0, sparse tensor integrity checks are disabled
  by default. As a result, maliciously crafted tensors can bypass internal bounds
  checks and trigger an out-of-bounds memory write during the call to to_dense().
  This memory corruption can crash vLLM and potentially lead to code execution on
  the server hosting vLLM."
