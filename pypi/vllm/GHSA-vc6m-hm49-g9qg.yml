title: "phi4mm: Quadratic Time Complexity in Input Token Processing​ leads to denial
  of service"
description: "A critical performance vulnerability has been identified in the input
  preprocessing logic of the multimodal tokenizer. The code dynamically replaces placeholder
  tokens (e.g., <|audio_*|>, <|image_*|>) with repeated tokens based on precomputed
  lengths. Due to ​​inefficient list concatenation operations​​, the algorithm exhibits
  ​​quadratic time complexity (O(n²))​​, allowing malicious actors to trigger resource
  exhaustion via specially crafted inputs."
