title: "vLLM vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) through MediaConnector"
description: "A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the `MediaConnector`
  class within the vLLM project's multimodal feature set. The load_from_url and load_from_url_async
  methods obtain and process media from URLs provided by users, using different Python
  parsing libraries when restricting the target host. These two parsing libraries
  have different interpretations of backslashes, which allows the host name restriction
  to be bypassed. This allows an attacker to coerce the vLLM server into making arbitrary
  requests to internal network resources.\n\nThis vulnerability is particularly critical
  in containerized environments like `llm-d`, where a compromised vLLM pod could be
  used to scan the internal network, interact with other pods, and potentially cause
  Denial of Service or access sensitive data. For example, an attacker could make
  the vLLM pod send malicious requests to an internal `llm-d` management endpoint,
  leading to system instability by falsely reporting metrics like the KV cache state."
