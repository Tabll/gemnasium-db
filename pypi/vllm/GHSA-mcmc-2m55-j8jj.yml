title: "vLLM introduced enhanced protection for CVE-2025-62164"
description: "The fix [here](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/27204) for
  CVE-2025-62164 is not sufficient. The fix only disables prompt embeds by default
  rather than addressing the root cause, so the DoS vulnerability remains when the
  feature is enabled."
