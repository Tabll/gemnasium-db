title: "vLLM allows Remote Code Execution by Pickle Deserialization via AsyncEngineRPCServer()
  RPC server entrypoints"
description: "vllm-project vllm version 0.6.0 contains a vulnerability in the AsyncEngineRPCServer()
  RPC server entrypoints. The core functionality run_server_loop() calls the function
  _make_handler_coro(), which directly uses cloudpickle.loads() on received messages
  without any sanitization. This can result in remote code execution by deserializing
  malicious pickle data."
