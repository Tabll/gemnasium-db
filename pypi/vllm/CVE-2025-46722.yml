title: "vLLM has a Weakness in MultiModalHasher Image Hashing Implementation"
description: "In the file `vllm/multimodal/hasher.py`, the `MultiModalHasher` class
  has a security and data integrity issue in its image hashing method. Currently,
  it serializes `PIL.Image.Image` objects using only `obj.tobytes()`, which returns
  only the raw pixel data, without including metadata such as the imageâ€™s shape (width,
  height, mode). As a result, two images of different sizes (e.g., 30x100 and 100x30)
  with the same pixel byte sequence could generate the same hash value. This may lead
  to hash collisions, incorrect cache hits, and even data leakage or security risks."
