package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Off-by-one Error"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  An attacker can trigger a heap buffer overflow in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizedResizeBilinear`
  by manipulating input values so that float rounding results in off-by-one error
  in accessing image elements. This is because the implementation computes two integers
  (representing the upper bounds for interpolation) by ceiling and flooring a floating
  point value. For some values of `in`, `interpolation->upper[i]` might be smaller
  than `interpolation->lower[i]`. This is an issue if `interpolation->upper[i]` is
  capped at `in_size-1` as it means that `interpolation->lower[i]` points outside
  of the image. Then, in the interpolation code, this would result in heap buffer
  overflow."
