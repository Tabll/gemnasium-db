package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer"
description: "In Tensorflow, the `SparseCountSparseOutput` and `RaggedCountSparseOutput`
  implementations don't validate that the `weights` tensor has the same shape as the
  data. The check exists for `DenseCountSparseOutput`, where both tensors are fully
  specified. In the sparse and ragged count weights are still accessed in parallel
  with the data. But, since there is no validation, a user passing fewer weights than
  the values for the tensors can generate a read from outside the bounds of the heap
  buffer allocated for the weights."
