identifier: "CVE-2021-37659"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Out-of-bounds Read"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  An attacker can cause undefined behavior via binding a reference to null pointer
  in all binary `cwise` operations that don't require broadcasting (e.g., gradients
  of binary `cwise` operations). The implementation assumes that the two inputs have
  exactly the same number of elements but does not check that. Hence, when the `eigen`
  functor executes it triggers heap OOB reads and undefined behavior due to binding
  to nullptr."
