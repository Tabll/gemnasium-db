package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Divide By Zero"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  An attacker can cause a division by zero to occur in `Conv2DBackpropFilter`. This
  is because the implementation computes a divisor based on user provided data (i.e.,
  the shape of the tensors given as arguments). If all shapes are empty then `work_unit_size`
  is Since there is no check for this case before division, this results in a runtime
  exception, with potential to be abused for a denial of service."
