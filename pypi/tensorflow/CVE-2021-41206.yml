package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Improper Validation of Integrity Check Value"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning.Depending
  on the API, this can result in undefined behavior and segfault or `CHECK`-fail related
  crashes but in some scenarios writes and reads from heap populated arrays are also
  possible. We have discovered these issues internally via tooling while working on
  improving/testing GPU op determinism. As such, we don't have reproducers and there
  will be multiple fixes for these issues."
