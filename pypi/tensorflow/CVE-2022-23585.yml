title: "Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime"
description: "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. When decoding
  PNG images TensorFlow can produce a memory leak if the image is invalid. After calling
  `png::CommonInitDecode(..., &decode)`, the `decode` value contains allocated buffers
  which can only be freed by calling `png::CommonFreeDecode(&decode)`. However, several
  error case in the function implementation invoke the `OP_REQUIRES` macro which immediately
  terminates the execution of the function, without allowing for the memory free to
  occur. The fix will be included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow, TensorFlow, and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still
  in supported range."
