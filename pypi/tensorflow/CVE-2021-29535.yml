identifier: "CVE-2021-29535"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Out-of-bounds Write"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  An attacker can cause a heap buffer overflow in `QuantizedMul` by passing in invalid
  thresholds for the quantization. This is because the implementation
  assumes that the 4 arguments are always valid scalars and tries to access the numeric
  value directly. However, if any of these tensors is empty, then `.flat<T>()` is
  an empty buffer and accessing the element at position 0 results in overflow."
