identifier: "CVE-2021-37687"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Out-of-bounds Read"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  TFLite's `GatherNd` does not support negative indices but there are no checks for
  this situation. Hence, an attacker can read arbitrary data from the heap by carefully
  crafting a model with negative values in `indices`. Similar issue exists in `Gather`."
