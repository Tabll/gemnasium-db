package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions"
description: "In Tensorflow, the `Shard` API in TensorFlow expects the last argument
  to be a function taking two `int64` arguments. However, there are several places
  in TensorFlow where a lambda taking `int` or `int32` arguments is being used. In
  these cases, if the amount of work to be parallelized is large enough, integer truncation
  occurs. Depending on how the two arguments of the lambda are used, this can result
  in segfaults, read/write outside heap allocated arrays, stack overflows, or data
  corruption."
