title: "Use After Free"
description: "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. A malicious
  user can cause a use after free behavior when decoding PNG images. After `png::CommonFreeDecode(&decode)`
  gets called, the values of `decode.width` and `decode.height` are in an unspecified
  state. The fix will be included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow, TensorFlow, and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still
  in supported range."
