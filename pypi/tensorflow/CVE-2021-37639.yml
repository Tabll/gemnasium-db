title: "NULL Pointer Dereference"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  When restoring tensors via raw APIs, if the tensor name is not provided, TensorFlow 
  can be tricked into dereferencing a null pointer. Alternatively, attackers can read 
  memory outside the bounds of heap allocated data by providing some tensor names but
   not enough for a successful restoration. The implementation retrieves the tensor 
   list corresponding to the `tensor_name` user controlled input and immediately 
   retrieves the tensor at the restoration index (controlled via `preferred_shard` 
   argument). This occurs without validating that the provided list has enough values. 
   If the list is empty this results in dereferencing a null pointer (undefined 
   behavior). If, however, the list has some elements, if the restoration index 
   is outside the bounds this results in heap OOB read."
