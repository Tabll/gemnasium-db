title: "NULL Pointer Dereference"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  When restoring tensors via raw APIs, if the tensor name is not provided, TensorFlow
  can be tricked into dereferencing a null pointer. Alternatively, attackers can read
  memory outside the bounds of heap allocated data by providing some tensor names
  but not enough for a successful restoration. The implementation retrieves the tensor
  list corresponding to the `tensor_name` user controlled input and immediately retrieves
  the tensor at the restoration index (controlled via `preferred_shard` argument).
  This occurs without validating that the provided list has enough values. If the
  list is empty this results in dereferencing a null pointer (undefined behavior).
  If, however, the list has some elements, if the restoration index is outside the
  bounds this results in heap OOB read."
