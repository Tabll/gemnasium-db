package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Out-of-bounds Read"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. The function
  MakeGrapplerFunctionItem takes arguments that determine the sizes of inputs and
  outputs. If the inputs given are greater than or equal to the sizes of the outputs,
  an out-of-bounds memory read or a crash is triggered. We have patched the issue
  in GitHub commit a65411a1d69edfb16b25907ffb8f73556ce36bb7. The fix will be included
  in TensorFlow 2.11.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.8.4, 2.9.3,
  and 2.10.1."
