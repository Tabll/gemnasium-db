identifier: "CVE-2021-37644"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Reachable Assertion"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  Providing a negative element to `num_elements` list argument of `tf.raw_ops.TensorListReserve`
  causes the runtime to abort the process due to reallocating a `std::vector` to have
  a negative number of elements. The implementation calls `std::vector.resize()` with
  the new size controlled by input given by the user, without checking that this input
  is valid."
