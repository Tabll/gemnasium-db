identifier: "CVE-2021-37643"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "NULL Pointer Dereference"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  If a user does not provide a valid padding value to `tf.raw_ops.MatrixDiagPartOp`,
  then the code triggers a null pointer dereference (if input is empty) or produces
  invalid behavior, ignoring all values after the first. The implementation reads
  the first value from a tensor buffer without first checking that the tensor has
  values to read from."
