title: "Divide By Zero"
description: "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. ### Impact
  An attacker can craft a TFLite model that would trigger a division by zero in the
  implementation of depthwise convolutions. The parameters of the convolution can
  be user controlled and are also used within a division operation to determine the
  size of the padding that needs to be added before applying the convolution. There
  is no check before this division that the divisor is strictly positive. The fix
  will be included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow,
  TensorFlow, and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still in supported range."
