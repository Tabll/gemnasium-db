title: "Reachable Assertion"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. When `CollectiveGather`
  receives an scalar input `input`, it gives a `CHECK` fails that can be used to trigger
  a denial of service attack. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit c1f491817dec39a26be3c574e86a88c30f3c4770.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected
  and still in supported range. There are no known workarounds for this issue."
