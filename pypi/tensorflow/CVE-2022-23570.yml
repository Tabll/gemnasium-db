title: "NULL Pointer Dereference"
description: "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. When decoding
  a tensor from protobuf, TensorFlow might do a null-dereference if attributes of
  some mutable arguments to some operations are missing from the proto. This is guarded
  by a `DCHECK`. However, `DCHECK` is a no-op in production builds and an assertion
  failure in debug builds. In the first case execution proceeds to the dereferencing
  of the null pointer, whereas in the second case it results in a crash due to the
  assertion failure. The fix will be included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick
  this commit on TensorFlow, and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still
  in supported range."
