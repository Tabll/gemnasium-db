identifier: "CVE-2020-15208"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Out-of-bounds Write"
description: "In tensorflow-lite, when determining the common dimension size of two
  tensors, `TFLite` uses a `DCHECK` which is no-op outside debug compilation modes.
  Since the function always returns the dimension of the first tensor, malicious attackers
  can craft cases where this is larger than that of the second tensor. In turn, this
  would result in reads/writes outside bounds since the interpreter will wrongly assume
  that there is enough data in both tensors."
