title: "Divide By Zero"
description: "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. An attacker
  can craft a TFLite model that would trigger a division by zero in `BiasAndClamp`
  implementation. There is no check that the `bias_size` is non zero. The fix will
  be included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow, TensorFlow,
  and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still in supported range."
