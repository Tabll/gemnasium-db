title: "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.MaxPool3DGradGrad` is vulnerable to a heap buffer
  overflow. The implementation does not check that the initialization of `Pool3dParameters`
  completes successfully. Since the constructor uses `OP_REQUIRES` to validate conditions,
  the first assertion that fails interrupts the initialization of `params`, making
  it contain invalid data. In turn, this might cause a heap buffer overflow, depending
  on default initialized values."
