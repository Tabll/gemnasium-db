title: "Memory corruption in Tensorflow"
description: "The implementation of `dlpack.to_dlpack` can be made to use uninitialized
  memory resulting in further memory corruption. This is because the pybind11 glue
  code assumes that the argument is a tensor:\nhttps://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0e68f4d3295eb0281a517c3662f6698992b7b2cf/tensorflow/python/tfe_wrapper.cc#L1361\n\nHowever,
  there is nothing stopping users from passing in a Python object instead of a tensor.\n```python\nIn
