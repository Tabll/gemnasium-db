title: "NULL Pointer Dereference"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  When a user does not supply arguments that determine a valid sparse tensor, `tf.raw_ops.SparseTensorSliceDataset`
  implementation can be made to dereference a null pointer. The implementation has
  some argument validation but fails to consider the case when either `indices` or
  `values` are provided for an empty sparse tensor when the other is not. If `indices`
  is empty, then code that performs validation (i.e., checking that the indices are
  monotonically increasing) results in a null pointer dereference. If `indices` as
  provided by the user is empty, then `indices` in the C++ code above is backed by
  an empty `std::vector`, hence calling `indices->dim_size(0)` results in null pointer
  dereferencing (same as calling `std::vector::at()` on an empty vector)."
