package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Out-of-bounds Write"
description: "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. TensorFlow
  is vulnerable to a heap OOB write in `Grappler`. The `set_output` function writes
  to an array at the specified index. Hence, this gives a malicious user a write primitive.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow,
  TensorFlow, and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still in supported range."
