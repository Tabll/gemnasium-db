title: "Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')"
description: "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation
  of shape inference for `ConcatV2` can be used to trigger a denial of service attack
  via a segfault caused by a type confusion. The `axis` argument is translated into
  `concat_dim` in the `ConcatShapeHelper` helper function. Then, a value for `min_rank`
  is computed based on `concat_dim`. This is then used to validate that the `values`
  tensor has at least the required rank. However, `WithRankAtLeast` receives the lower
  bound as a value and then compares it against the maximum integer value that could
  be represented. Due to the fact that `min_rank` is a value and the value of `axis`,
  the `rank` argument is a negative value, so the error check is bypassed. The fix
  will be included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow,
  TensorFlow, and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still in supported range."
