title: "Integer Overflow or Wraparound"
description: "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation
  of `AddManySparseToTensorsMap` is vulnerable to an integer overflow which results
  in a `CHECK`-fail when building new `TensorShape` objects (so, an assert failure
  based denial of service). We are missing some validation on the shapes of the input
  tensors as well as directly constructing a large `TensorShape` with user-provided
  dimensions. The fix will be included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this
  commit on TensorFlow, TensorFlow, and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and
  still in supported range."
