identifier: "CVE-2021-37655"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Out-of-bounds Read"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  An attacker can trigger a read from outside of bounds of heap allocated data by
  sending invalid arguments to `tf.raw_ops.ResourceScatterUpdate`. The implementation
  has an incomplete validation of the relationship between the shapes of `indices`
  and `updates`, instead of checking that the shape of `indices` is a prefix of the
  shape of `updates` (so that broadcasting can happen), code only checks that the
  number of elements in these two tensors are in a divisibility relationship."
