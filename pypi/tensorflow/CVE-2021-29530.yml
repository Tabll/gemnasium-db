package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "NULL Pointer Dereference"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  An attacker can trigger a null pointer dereference by providing an invalid `permutation`
  to `tf.raw_ops.SparseMatrixSparseCholesky`. This is because the implementation fails
  to properly validate the input arguments. Although `ValidateInputs` is called and
  there are checks in the body of this function, the code proceeds to the next line
  in `ValidateInputs` since `OP_REQUIRES` is a macro that only exits the current function.
  Thus, the first validation condition that fails in `ValidateInputs` will cause an
  early return from that function. However, the caller will continue execution from
  the next line. The fix is to either explicitly check `context->status()` or to convert
  `ValidateInputs` to return a `Status`."
