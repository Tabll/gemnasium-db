title: "NULL Pointer Dereference"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  The code for `tf.raw_ops.SaveV2` does not properly validate the inputs and an 
  attacker can trigger a null pointer dereference. The implementation uses 
  `ValidateInputs` to check that the input arguments are valid. This validation 
  would have caught the illegal state represented by the reproducer above. However, 
  the validation uses `OP_REQUIRES` which translates to setting the `Status` object 
  of the current `OpKernelContext` to an error status, followed by an empty `return` 
  statement which just terminates the execution of the function it is present in. 
  However, this does not mean that the kernel execution is finalized, instead, 
  execution continues from the next line in `Compute` that follows the call to 
  `ValidateInputs`. This is equivalent to lacking the validation. "
