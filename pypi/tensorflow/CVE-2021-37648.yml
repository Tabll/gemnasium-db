title: "NULL Pointer Dereference"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  The code for `tf.raw_ops.SaveV2` does not properly validate the inputs and an attacker
  can trigger a null pointer dereference. The implementation uses `ValidateInputs`
  to check that the input arguments are valid. This validation would have caught the
  illegal state represented by the reproducer above. However, the validation uses
  `OP_REQUIRES` which translates to setting the `Status` object of the current `OpKernelContext`
  to an error status, followed by an empty `return` statement which just terminates
  the execution of the function it is present in. However, this does not mean that
  the kernel execution is finalized, instead, execution continues from the next line
  in `Compute` that follows the call to `ValidateInputs`. This is equivalent to lacking
  the validation. "
