title: "Use After Free"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  The implementation for `tf.raw_ops.BoostedTreesCreateEnsemble` can result in a use
  after free error if an attacker supplies specially crafted arguments. The implementation
  uses a reference counted resource and decrements the refcount if the initialization
  fails, as it should. However, when the code was written, the resource was represented
  as a naked pointer but later refactoring has changed it to be a smart pointer. Thus,
  when the pointer leaves the scope, a subsequent `free`-ing of the resource occurs,
  but this fails to take into account that the refcount has already reached 0, thus
  the resource has been already freed. During this double-free process, members of
  the resource object are accessed for cleanup but they are invalid as the entire
  resource has been freed."
