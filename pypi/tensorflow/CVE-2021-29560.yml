package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Out-of-bounds Read"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  An attacker can cause a heap buffer overflow in `tf.raw_ops.RaggedTensorToTensor`.
  This is because the implementation uses the same index to access two arrays in parallel.
  Since the user controls the shape of the input arguments, an attacker could trigger
  a heap OOB access when `parent_output_index` is shorter than `row_split`."
