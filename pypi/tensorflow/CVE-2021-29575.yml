identifier: "CVE-2021-29575"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Buffer Overflow"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.ReverseSequence` allows for stack overflow and/or
  `CHECK`-fail based denial of service. The implementation fails to validate that
  `seq_dim` and `batch_dim` arguments are valid. Negative values for `seq_dim` can
  result in stack overflow or `CHECK`-failure, depending on the version of Eigen code
  used to implement the operation. Similar behavior can be exhibited by invalid values
  of `batch_dim`."
