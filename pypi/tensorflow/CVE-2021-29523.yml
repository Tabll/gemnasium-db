identifier: "CVE-2021-29523"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Integer Overflow or Wraparound"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  An attacker can trigger a denial of service via a `CHECK`-fail in `tf.raw_ops.AddManySparseToTensorsMap`.
  This is because the implementation takes the values specified in `sparse_shape`
  as dimensions for the output shape. The `TensorShape` constructor uses a `CHECK`
  operation which triggers when `InitDims` returns a non-OK status. This is a legacy
  implementation of the constructor and operations should use `BuildTensorShapeBase`
  or `AddDimWithStatus` to prevent `CHECK`-failures in the presence of overflows."
