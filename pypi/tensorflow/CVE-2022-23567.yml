title: "Integer Overflow or Wraparound"
description: "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementations
  of `Sparse*Cwise*` ops is vulnerable to integer overflows. These can be used to
  trigger large allocations (so, OOM based denial of service) or `CHECK`-fails when
  building new `TensorShape` objects (so, assert failures based denial of service).
  We are missing some validation on the shapes of the input tensors as well as directly
  constructing a large `TensorShape` with user-provided dimensions. The fix will be
  included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow, TensorFlow,
  and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still in supported range."
