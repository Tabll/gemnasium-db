identifier: "CVE-2021-29584"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Integer Overflow or Wraparound"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  An attacker can trigger a denial of service via a `CHECK`-fail in caused by an integer
  overflow in constructing a new tensor shape. This is because the implementation
  builds a dense shape without checking that the dimensions would not result in overflow.
  The `TensorShape` constructor uses a `CHECK` operation which triggers when `InitDims`
  returns a non-OK status. This is a legacy implementation of the constructor and
  operations should use `BuildTensorShapeBase` or `AddDimWithStatus` to prevent `CHECK`-failures
  in the presence of overflows."
