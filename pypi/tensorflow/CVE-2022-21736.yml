title: "NULL Pointer Dereference"
description: "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation
  of `SparseTensorSliceDataset` has an undefined behavior: under certain condition
  it can be made to dereference a `nullptr` value. The 3 input arguments to `SparseTensorSliceDataset`
  represent a sparse tensor. However, there are some preconditions that these arguments
  must satisfy but these are not validated in the implementation. The fix will be
  included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow, TensorFlow,
  and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still in supported range."
