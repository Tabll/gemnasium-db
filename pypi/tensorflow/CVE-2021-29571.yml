package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Out-of-bounds Write"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.MaxPoolGradWithArgmax` can cause reads outside
  of bounds of heap allocated data if attacker supplies specially crafted inputs.
  Since this is not checked attackers passing values less than 4 can write outside
  of bounds of heap allocated objects and cause memory corruption. If the last dimension
  in `boxes` is less than 4, accesses similar to `tboxes(b, bb, 3)` will access data
  outside of bounds. Further during code execution there are also writes to these
  indices."
