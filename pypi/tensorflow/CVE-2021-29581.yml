package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Use of Uninitialized Resource"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  Due to lack of validation in `tf.raw_ops.CTCBeamSearchDecoder`, an attacker can
  trigger denial of service via segmentation faults. The implementation fails to detect
  cases when the input tensor is empty and proceeds to read data from a null buffer."
