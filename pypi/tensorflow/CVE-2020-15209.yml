package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "NULL Pointer Dereference"
description: "In tensorflow-lite, a crafted `TFLite` model can force a node to have
  as input a tensor backed by a `nullptr` buffer. This can be achieved by changing
  a buffer index in the flatbuffer serialization to convert a read-only tensor to
  a read-write one. The runtime assumes that these buffers are written to before a
  possible read, hence they are initialized with `nullptr`. However, by changing the
  buffer index for a tensor and implicitly converting that tensor to be a read-write
  one, as there is nothing in the model that writes to it, we get a null pointer dereference."
