package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  The shape inference implementation uses `axis` to select between two different values
  for `minmax_rank` which is then used to retrieve tensor dimensions. However, code
  assumes that `axis` can be either `-1` or a value greater than `-1`, with no validation
  for the other values. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit da857cfa0fde8f79ad0afdbc94e88b5d4bbec764.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow,
  TensorFlow, and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still in supported range."
