identifier: "CVE-2021-37641"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Out-of-bounds Read"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  If the arguments to `tf.raw_ops.RaggedGather` don't determine a valid ragged tensor
  c ode can trigger a read from outside of bounds of heap allocated buffers. The implementation
  directly reads the first dimension of a tensor shape before checking that said tensor
  has rank of at least 1 (i.e., it is not a scalar). Furthermore, the implementation
  does not check that the list given by `params_nested_splits` is not an empty list
  of tensors."
