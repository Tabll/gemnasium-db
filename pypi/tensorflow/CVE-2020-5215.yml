identifier: "CVE-2020-5215"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "In TensorFlow converting a string (from Python) to a `tf.float16` value
  results in a segmentation fault in eager mode as the format checks for this use
  case are only in the graph mode. This issue can lead to denial of service in inference/training
  where a malicious attacker can send a data point which contains a string instead
  of a tf.float16 value. Similar effects can be obtained by manipulating saved models
  and checkpoints whereby replacing a scalar tf.float16 value with a scalar string
  will trigger this issue due to automatic conversions. This can be easily reproduced
  by `tf.constant(\"hello\", tf.float16)`, if eager execution is enabled."
