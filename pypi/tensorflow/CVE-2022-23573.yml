title: "Use of Uninitialized Resource"
description: "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation
  of `AssignOp` can result in copying uninitialized data to a new tensor. This later
  results in undefined behavior. The implementation has a check that the left hand
  side of the assignment is initialized (to minimize number of allocations), but does
  not check that the right hand side is also initialized. The fix will be included
  in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow, TensorFlow, and
  TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still in supported range."
