package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Uninitialized variable access in Tensorflow"
description: "The [implementation of `AssignOp`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a1320ec1eac186da1d03f033109191f715b2b130/tensorflow/core/kernels/assign_op.h#L30-L143)
  can result in copying unitialized data to a new tensor. This later results in undefined
  behavior.\n\nThe implementation has a check that the left hand side of the assignment
  is initialized (to minimize number of allocations), but does not check that the
  right hand side is also initialized."
