package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Divide By Zero"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  An attacker can cause a floating point exception by calling inplace operations with 
  crafted arguments that would result in a division by 0. The implementation has a 
  logic error, it should skip processing if `x` and `v` are empty but the code 
  uses `||` instead of `&&`."
