package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Divide By Zero"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  A malicious user could trigger a division by 0 in `Conv3D` implementation. The implementation
  does a modulo operation based on user controlled input. Thus, when `filter` has
  a 0 as the fifth element, this results in a division by Additionally, if the shape
  of the two tensors is not valid, an Eigen assertion can be triggered, resulting
  in a program crash."
