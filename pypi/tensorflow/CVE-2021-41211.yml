package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Out-of-bounds Read"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning.This occurs
  whenever `axis` is a negative value less than `-1`. In this case, we are accessing
  data before the start of a heap buffer. The code allows `axis` to be an optional
  argument (`s` would contain an `error::NOT_FOUND` error code). Otherwise, it assumes
  that `axis` is a valid index into the dimensions of the `input` tensor. If `axis`
  is less than `-1` then this results in a heap OOB read."
