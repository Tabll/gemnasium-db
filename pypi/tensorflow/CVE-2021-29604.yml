title: "Divide By Zero"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  The TFLite implementation of hashtable lookup is vulnerable to a division by zero
  error
  An attacker can craft a model such that `values`'s first dimension would be 0. The
  fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on
  TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these
  are also affected and still in supported range."
