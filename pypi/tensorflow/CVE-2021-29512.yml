identifier: "CVE-2021-29512"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Out-of-bounds Write"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  If the `splits` argument of `RaggedBincount` does not specify a valid `SparseTensor`,
  then an attacker can trigger a heap buffer overflow. This will cause a read from
  outside the bounds of the `splits` tensor buffer in the implementation of the `RaggedBincount`
  op. Before the `for` loop, `batch_idx` is set to The user controls the `splits`
  array, making it contain only one element Thus, the code in the `while` loop would
  increment `batch_idx` and then try to read `splits(1)`, which is outside of bounds."
