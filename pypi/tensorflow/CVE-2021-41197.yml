package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Integer Overflow or Wraparound"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning.However,
  the total number of elements in a tensor must fit within an `int64_t`. If an overflow
  occurs, `MultiplyWithoutOverflow` would return a negative result. In the majority
  of TensorFlow codebase this then results in a `CHECK`-failure. Newer constructs
  exist which return a `Status` instead of crashing the binary."
