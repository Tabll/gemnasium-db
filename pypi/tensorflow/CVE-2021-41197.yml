package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Crashes due to overflow and `CHECK`-fail in ops with large tensor shapes"
description: "TensorFlow allows tensor to have a large number of dimensions and each
  dimension can be as large as desired. However, the total number of elements in a
  tensor must fit within an `int64_t`. If an overflow occurs, `MultiplyWithoutOverflow`
  would return a negative result. In the majority of TensorFlow codebase this then
  results in a `CHECK`-failure. Newer constructs exist which return a `Status` instead
  of crashing the binary."
