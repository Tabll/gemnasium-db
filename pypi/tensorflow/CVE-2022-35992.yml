title: "Reachable Assertion"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. When `TensorListFromTensor`
  receives an `element_shape` of a rank greater than one, it gives a `CHECK` fail
  that can trigger a denial of service attack. We have patched the issue in GitHub
  commit 3db59a042a38f4338aa207922fa2f476e000a6ee. The fix will be included in TensorFlow
  2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1,
  and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range. There
  are no known workarounds for this issue."
