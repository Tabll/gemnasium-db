package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Out-of-bounds Write"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  An attacker can write outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays by passing invalid
  arguments to `tf.raw_ops.Dilation2DBackpropInput`. This is because the implementation
  does not validate before writing to the output array. The values for `h_out` and
  `w_out` are guaranteed to be in range for `out_backprop` (as they are loop indices
  bounded by the size of the array). However, there are no similar guarantees relating
  `h_in_max`/`w_in_max` and `in_backprop`."
