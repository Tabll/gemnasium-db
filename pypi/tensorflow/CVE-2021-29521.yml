identifier: "CVE-2021-29521"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  Specifying a negative dense shape in `tf.raw_ops.SparseCountSparseOutput` results
  in a segmentation fault being thrown out from the standard library as `std::vector`
  invariants are broken. This is because the implementation assumes the first element
  of the dense shape is always positive and uses it to initialize a `BatchedMap<T>`
  (i.e., `std::vector<absl::flat_hash_map<int64,T>>` data structure. If the `shape`
  tensor has more than one element, `num_batches` is the first value in `shape`. Ensuring
  that the `dense_shape` argument is a valid tensor shape (that is, all elements are
  non-negative) solves this issue."
