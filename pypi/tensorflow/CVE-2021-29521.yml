identifier: "CVE-2021-29521"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  Specifying a negative dense shape in `tf.raw_ops.SparseCountSparseOutput` results
  in a segmentation fault being thrown out from the standard library as `std::vector`
  invariants are broken. This is because the implementation
  assumes the first element of the dense shape is always positive and uses it to initialize
  a `BatchedMap<T>` (i.e., `std::vector<absl::flat_hash_map<int64,T>>`
  data structure. If the `shape` tensor has more than one element, `num_batches` is
  the first value in `shape`. Ensuring that the `dense_shape` argument is a valid
  tensor shape (that is, all elements are non-negative) solves this issue."
