identifier: "CVE-2021-29531"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  An attacker can trigger a `CHECK` fail in PNG encoding by providing an empty input
  tensor as the pixel data. This is because the implementation only validates that
  the total number of pixels in the image does not overflow. Thus, an attacker can
  send an empty matrix for encoding. However, if the tensor is empty, then the associated
  buffer is `nullptr`. Hence, when calling `png::WriteImageToBuffer`, the first argument
  (i.e., `image.flat<T>().data()`) is `NULL`. This then triggers the `CHECK_NOTNULL`
  in the first line of `png::WriteImageToBuffer`. Since `image` is null, this results
  in `abort` being called after printing the stacktrace. Effectively, this allows
  an attacker to mount a denial of service attack."
