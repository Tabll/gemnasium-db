identifier: "CVE-2021-29603"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Out-of-bounds Write"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  A specially crafted TFLite model could trigger an OOB write on heap in the TFLite
  implementation of `ArgMin`/`ArgMax` If `axis_value` is not a value between 0 and
  `NumDimensions(input)`, then the condition in the `if` is never true, so code writes
  past the last valid element of `output_dims->data`."
