title: "Out-of-bounds Read"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  The implementation of sparse reduction operations in TensorFlow can trigger accesses
  outside of bounds of heap allocated data. The implementation fails to validate that
  each reduction group does not overflow and that each corresponding index does not
  point to outside the bounds of the input tensor."
