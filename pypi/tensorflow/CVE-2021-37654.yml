identifier: "CVE-2021-37654"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Out-of-bounds Read"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  An attacker can trigger a crash via a `CHECK`-fail in debug builds of TensorFlow
  using `tf.raw_ops.ResourceGather` or a read from outside the bounds of heap allocated
  data in the same API in a release build. The implementation does not check that
  the `batch_dims` value that the user supplies is less than the rank of the input
  tensor. Since the implementation uses several for loops over the dimensions of `tensor`,
  this results in reading data from outside the bounds of heap allocated buffer backing
  the tensor."
