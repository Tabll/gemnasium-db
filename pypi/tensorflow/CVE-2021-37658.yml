identifier: "CVE-2021-37658"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Access of Uninitialized Pointer"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  An attacker can cause undefined behavior via binding a reference to null pointer in 
  all operations of type `tf.raw_ops.MatrixSetDiagV*`. The implementation has incomplete 
  validation that the value of `k` is a valid tensor. We have check that this value is 
  either a scalar or a vector, but there is no check for the number of elements. If this 
  is an empty tensor, then code that accesses the first element of the tensor is wrong."
