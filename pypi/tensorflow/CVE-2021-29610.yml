identifier: "CVE-2021-29610"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Improper Initialization"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  The validation in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeAndDequantizeV2` allows invalid values for
  `axis` argument:. The validation uses `||` to mix two different conditions. If `axis_
  < -1` the condition in `OP_REQUIRES` will still be true, but this value of `axis_`
  results in heap underflow. This allows attackers to read/write to other data on
  the heap."
