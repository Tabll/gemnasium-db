package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Out-of-bounds Read"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.MaxPoolGradWithArgmax` can cause reads outside
  of bounds of heap allocated data if attacker supplies specially crafted inputs.
  The implementation assumes that the `input_min` and `input_max` tensors have at
  least one element, as it accesses the first element in two arrays. If the tensors
  are empty, `.flat<T>()` is an empty object, backed by an empty array. Hence, accesing
  even the 0th element is a read outside the bounds."
