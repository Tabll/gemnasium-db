package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Reachable Assertion"
description: "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. A malicious
  user can cause a denial of service by altering a `SavedModel` such that Grappler
  optimizer would attempt to build a tensor using a reference `dtype`. This would
  result in a crash due to a `CHECK`-fail in the `Tensor` constructor as reference
  types are not allowed. The fix will be included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick
  this commit on TensorFlow, TensorFlow, and TensorFlow, as these are also affected
  and still in supported range."
