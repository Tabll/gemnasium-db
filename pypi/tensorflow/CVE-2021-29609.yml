identifier: "CVE-2021-29609"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Out-of-bounds Write"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  Incomplete validation in `SparseAdd` results in allowing attackers to exploit undefined
  behavior (dereferencing null pointers) as well as write outside of bounds of heap
  allocated data. The implementation has a large set of validation for the two sparse
  tensor inputs (6 tensors in total), but does not validate that the tensors are not
  empty or that the second dimension of `*_indices` matches the size of corresponding
  `*_shape`. This allows attackers to send tensor triples that represent invalid sparse
  tensors to abuse code assumptions that are not protected by validation."
