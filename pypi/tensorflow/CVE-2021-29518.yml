identifier: "CVE-2021-29518"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "NULL Pointer Dereference"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  In eager mode (default in TF), session operations are invalid. However, users could
  still call the raw ops associated with them and trigger a null pointer dereference.
  The implementation
  dereferences the session state pointer without checking if it is valid. Thus, in
  eager mode, `ctx->session_state()` is nullptr and the call of the member function
  is undefined behavior."
