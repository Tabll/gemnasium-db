package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "NULL Pointer Dereference"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  In eager mode (default in TF), session operations are invalid. However, users could
  still call the raw ops associated with them and trigger a null pointer dereference.
  The implementation dereferences the session state pointer without checking if it
  is valid. Thus, in eager mode, `ctx->session_state()` is nullptr and the call of
  the member function is undefined behavior."
