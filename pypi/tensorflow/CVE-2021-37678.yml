identifier: "CVE-2021-37678"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  The implementation uses `yaml.unsafe_load` which can perform arbitrary code execution
  on the input. Given that YAML format support requires a significant amount of work,
  we have removed it for now. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit d6383eb6c14084a8fc3bdf164043b974818012.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow,
  TensorFlow, and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still in supported range."
