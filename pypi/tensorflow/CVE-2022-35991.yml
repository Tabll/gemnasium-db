title: "Reachable Assertion"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. When `TensorListScatter`
  and `TensorListScatterV2` receive an `element_shape` of a rank greater than one,
  they give a `CHECK` fail that can trigger a denial of service attack. We have patched
  the issue in GitHub commit bb03fdf4aae944ab2e4b35c7daa051068a8b7f61. The fix will
  be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still
  in supported range. There are no known workarounds for this issue."
