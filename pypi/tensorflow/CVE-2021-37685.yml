identifier: "CVE-2021-37685"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Out-of-bounds Read"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  TFLite's `expand_dims.cc` contains a vulnerability which allows reading one element
  outside of bounds of heap allocated data. If `axis` is a large negative value (e.g.,
  `-100000`), then after the first `if` it would still be negative. The check following
  the `if` statement will pass and the `for` loop would read one element before the
  start of `input_dims.data` (when `i = 0`)."
