title: "Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. When printing
  a tensor, we get it's data as a `const char*` array (since that's the underlying
  storage) and then we typecast it to the element type. However, conversions from
  `char` to `bool` are undefined if the `char` is not `0` or `1`, so sanitizers/fuzzers
  will crash. The issue has been patched in GitHub commit `1be74370327`. The fix will
  be included in TensorFlow 2.11.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.10.1, TensorFlow 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still
  in supported range."
