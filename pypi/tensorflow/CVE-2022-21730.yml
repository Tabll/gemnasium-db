title: "Out-of-bounds Read"
description: "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation
  of `FractionalAvgPoolGrad` does not consider cases where the input tensors are invalid
  allowing an attacker to read from outside of bounds of heap. The fix will be included
  in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow, TensorFlow, and
  TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still in supported range."
