identifier: "CVE-2021-37686"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition (Infinite Loop)"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  The strided slice implementation in `TFLite` has a logic bug which can allow an
  attacker to trigger an infinite loop. This arises from newly introduced support
  for ellipsis in axis definition. An attacker can craft a model such that `ellipsis_end_idx`
  is smaller than `i` (e.g., always negative). In this case, the inner loop does not
  increase `i` and the `continue` statement causes execution to skip over the preincrement
  at the end of the outer loop."
