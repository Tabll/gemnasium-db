package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Out-of-bounds Read"
description: "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The TFG dialect
  of TensorFlow (MLIR) makes several assumptions about the incoming `GraphDef` before
  converting it to the MLIR-based dialect. If an attacker changes the `SavedModel`
  format on disk to invalidate these assumptions and the `GraphDef` is then converted
  to MLIR-based IR then they can cause a crash in the Python interpreter. Under certain
  scenarios, heap OOB read/writes are possible. These issues have been discovered
  via fuzzing and it is possible that more weaknesses exist. We will patch them as
  they are discovered."
