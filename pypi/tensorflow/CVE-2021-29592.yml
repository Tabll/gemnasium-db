title: "Null pointer dereference in TFLite's `Reshape` operator"
description: "The fix for [CVE-2020-15209](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15209)
  missed the case when the target shape of `Reshape` operator is given by the elements
  of a 1-D tensor. As such, the [fix for the vulnerability](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/9c1dc920d8ffb4893d6c9d27d1f039607b326743/tensorflow/lite/core/subgraph.cc#L1062-L1074)
  allowed passing a null-buffer-backed tensor with a 1D shape:\n\n```cc\nif (tensor->data.raw
  == nullptr && tensor->bytes > 0) {\nif (registration.builtin_code == kTfLiteBuiltinReshape
  && i == 1) {\n// In general, having a tensor here with no buffer will be an error.\n//
  However, for the reshape operator, the second input tensor is only\n// used for
  the shape, not for the data. Thus, null buffer is ok.\ncontinue;\n} else {\n// In
  all other cases, we need to return an error as otherwise we will\n// trigger a null
  pointer dereference (likely).\nReportError(\"Input tensor %d lacks data\", tensor_index);\nreturn
  kTfLiteError;\n}\n}\n```"
