title: "Overflow/crash in `tf.image.resize` when size is large"
description: "If `tf.image.resize` is called with a large input argument then the
  TensorFlow process will crash due to a `CHECK`-failure caused by an overflow.\n\n```python\nimport
  tensorflow as tf\nimport numpy as np\n\ntf.keras.layers.UpSampling2D(\nsize=1610637938,\ndata_format='channels_first',\ninterpolation='bilinear')(np.ones((5,1,1,1)))\n```\n\nThe
  number of elements in the output tensor is too much for the `int64_t` type and the
  overflow is detected via a `CHECK` statement. This aborts the process."
