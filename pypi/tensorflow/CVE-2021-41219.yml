package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Out-of-bounds Read"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning.This occurs
  whenever the dimensions of `a` or `b` are 0 or less. In the case on one of these
  is 0, an empty output tensor should be allocated (to conserve the invariant that
  output tensors are always allocated when the operation is successful) but nothing
  should be written to it (that is, we should return early from the kernel implementation).
  Otherwise, attempts to write to this empty tensor would result in heap OOB access."
