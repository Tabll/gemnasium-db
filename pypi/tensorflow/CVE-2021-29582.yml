identifier: "CVE-2021-29582"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Out-of-bounds Read"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  Due to lack of validation in `tf.raw_ops.Dequantize`, an attacker can trigger a
  read from outside of bounds of heap allocated data. The implementation
  accesses the `min_range` and `max_range` tensors in parallel but fails to check
  that they have the same shape."
