description: "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The `simplifyBroadcast`
  function in the MLIR-TFRT infrastructure in TensorFlow is vulnerable to a segfault
  (hence, denial of service), if called with scalar shapes. If all shapes are scalar,
  then `maxRank` is 0, so we build an empty `SmallVector`."
