package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Out-of-bounds Read"
description: "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. TensorFlow's
  type inference can cause a heap out-of-bounds read as the bounds checking is done
  in a `DCHECK` (which is a no-op during production). An attacker can control the
  `input_idx` variable such that `ix` would be larger than the number of values in
  `node_t.args`."
