package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.StringNGrams` is vulnerable to an integer overflow
  issue caused by converting a signed integer value to an unsigned one and then allocating
  memory based on this value. The implementation calls `reserve` on a `tstring` with
  a value that sometimes can be negative if user supplies negative `ngram_widths`.
  The `reserve` method calls `TF_TString_Reserve` which has an `unsigned long` argument
  for the size of the buffer. Hence, the implicit conversion transforms the negative
  value to a large integer."
