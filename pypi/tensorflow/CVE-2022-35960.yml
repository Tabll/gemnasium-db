title: "Reachable Assertion"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In `core/kernels/list_kernels.cc's
  TensorListReserve`, `num_elements` is assumed to be a tensor of size 1. When a `num_elements`
  of more than 1 element is provided, then `tf.raw_ops.TensorListReserve` fails the
  `CHECK_EQ` in `CheckIsAlignedAndSingleElement`. We have patched the issue in GitHub
  commit b5f6fbfba76576202b72119897561e3bd4f179c7. The fix will be included in TensorFlow
  2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1,
  and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range. There
  are no known workarounds for this issue."
