package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Access of Uninitialized Pointer"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  An attacker can trigger undefined behavior by binding to null pointer in `tf.raw_ops.ParameterizedTruncatedNormal`.
  This is because the implementation does not validate input arguments before accessing
  the first element of `shape`. If `shape` argument is empty, then `shape_tensor.flat<T>()`
  is an empty array."
