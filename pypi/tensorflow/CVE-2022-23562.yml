title: "Integer Overflow or Wraparound"
description: "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation
  of `Range` suffers from integer overflows. These can trigger undefined behavior
  or, in some scenarios, extremely large allocations. The fix will be included in
  TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow, TensorFlow, and TensorFlow,
  as these are also affected and still in supported range."
