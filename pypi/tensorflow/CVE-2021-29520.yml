package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Buffer Overflow"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  Missing validation between arguments to `tf.raw_ops.Conv3DBackprop*` operations
  can result in heap buffer overflows. This is because the implementation assumes
  that the `input`, `filter_sizes` and `out_backprop` tensors have the same shape,
  as they are accessed in parallel."
