package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "In Tensorflow, if a user passes a list of strings to `dlpack.to_dlpack`
  there is a memory leak following an expected validation failure. The issue occurs
  because the `status` argument during validation failures is not properly checked.
  Since each of the above methods can return an error status, the `status` value must
  be checked before continuing."
