title: "Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions"
description: "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. Under certain
  scenarios, TensorFlow can fail to specialize a type during shape inference. This
  case is covered by the `DCHECK` function however, `DCHECK` is a no-op in production
  builds and an assertion failure in debug builds. In the first case execution proceeds
  to the `ValueOrDie` line. This results in an assertion failure as `ret` contains
  an error `Status`, not a value. In the second case we also get a crash due to the
  assertion failure. The fix will be included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick
  this commit on TensorFlow, and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still
  in supported range."
