title: "Reachable Assertion"
description: "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The Grappler
  optimizer in TensorFlow can be used to cause a denial of service by altering a `SavedModel`
  such that `SafeToRemoveIdentity` would trigger `CHECK` failures. The fix will be
  included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow, TensorFlow,
  and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still in supported range."
