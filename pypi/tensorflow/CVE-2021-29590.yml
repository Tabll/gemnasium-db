package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Out-of-bounds Read"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  The implementations of the `Minimum` and `Maximum` TFLite operators can be used
  to read data outside of bounds of heap allocated objects, if any of the two input
  tensor arguments are empty. This is because the broadcasting implementation indexes
  in both tensors with the same index but does not validate that the index is within
  bounds."
