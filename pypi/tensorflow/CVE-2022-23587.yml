package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Integer Overflow or Wraparound"
description: "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. Under certain
  scenarios, Grappler component of TensorFlow is vulnerable to an integer overflow
  during cost estimation for crop and resize. Since the cropping parameters are user
  controlled, a malicious person can trigger undefined behavior. The fix will be included
  in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow, TensorFlow, and
  TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still in supported range."
