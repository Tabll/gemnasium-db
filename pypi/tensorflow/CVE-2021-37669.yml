identifier: "CVE-2021-37669"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  The implementation uses a user controlled argument to resize a `std::vector`. However,
  as `std::vector::resize` takes the size argument as a `size_t` and `output_size`
  is an `int`, there is an implicit conversion to unsigned. If the attacker supplies
  a negative value, this conversion results in a crash. A similar issue occurs in
  `CombinedNonMaxSuppression`. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 3a7362750d5c372420aa8f0caf7bf5b5c3d0f52d
  and commit [b5cdbf12ffcaaffecf98f22a6be5a64bb96e4f58. The fix will be included in
  TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow, TensorFlow, and TensorFlow,
  as these are also affected and still in supported range."
