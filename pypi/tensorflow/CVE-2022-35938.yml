title: "Out-of-bounds Read"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. The `GatherNd`
  function takes arguments that determine the sizes of inputs and outputs. If the
  inputs given are greater than or equal to the sizes of the outputs, an out-of-bounds
  memory read or a crash is triggered. This issue has been patched in GitHub commit
  4142e47e9e31db481781b955ed3ff807a781b494. The fix will be included in TensorFlow
  2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1,
  and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range. There
  are no known workarounds for this issue."
