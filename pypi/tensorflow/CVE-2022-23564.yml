title: "Reachable Assertion"
description: "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. When decoding
  a resource handle tensor from protobuf, a TensorFlow process can encounter cases
  where a `CHECK` assertion is invalidated based on user controlled arguments. This
  allows attackers to cause denial of services in TensorFlow processes. The fix will
  be included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow, TensorFlow,
  and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still in supported range."
