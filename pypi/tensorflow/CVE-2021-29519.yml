identifier: "CVE-2021-29519"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type (Type Confusion)"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  The API of `tf.raw_ops.SparseCross` allows combinations which would result in a
  `CHECK`-failure and denial of service. This is because the implementation is tricked
  to consider a tensor of type `tstring` which in fact contains integral elements.
  Fixing the type confusion by preventing mixing `DT_STRING` and `DT_INT64` types
  solves this issue."
