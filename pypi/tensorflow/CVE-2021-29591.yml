title: "Stack overflow due to looping TFLite subgraph"
description: "TFlite graphs must not have loops between nodes. However, this condition
  was not checked and an attacker could craft models that would result in infinite
  loop during evaluation. In certain cases, the infinite loop would be replaced by
  stack overflow due to too many recursive calls."
