package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer"
description: "In tensorflow-lite, to mimic Python's indexing with negative values,
  TFLite uses `ResolveAxis` to convert negative values to positive indices. However,
  the only check that the converted index is now valid is only present in debug builds.
  If the `DCHECK` does not trigger, then code execution moves ahead with a negative
  index. This, in turn, results in accessing data out-of-bounds which results in segfaults
  `and/or` data corruption."
