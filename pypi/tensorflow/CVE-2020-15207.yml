package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Segfault and data corruption in tensorflow-lite"
description: "To mimic Python's indexing with negative values, TFLite uses `ResolveAxis`
  to convert negative values to positive indices. However, the only check that the
  converted index is now valid is only present in debug builds:\nhttps://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0e68f4d3295eb0281a517c3662f6698992b7b2cf/tensorflow/lite/kernels/internal/reference/reduce.h#L68-L72\n\nIf
  the `DCHECK` does not trigger, then code execution moves ahead with a negative index.
  This, in turn, results in accessing data out of bounds which results in segfaults
  and/or data corruption."
