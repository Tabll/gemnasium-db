package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  The implementation does not check that the `key` input is a valid non-empty tensor.
  We have patched the issue in GitHub commit d7de67733925de196ec8863a33445b73f9562d1d.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow,
  TensorFlow, and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still in supported range."
