package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Access of Uninitialized Pointer"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affeced
  versions during execution, `EinsumHelper::ParseEquation()` is supposed to set the
  flags in `input_has_ellipsis` vector and `*output_has_ellipsis` boolean to indicate
  whether there is ellipsis in the corresponding inputs and output. However, the code
  only changes these flags to `true` and never assigns `false`. This results in unitialized
  variable access if callers assume that `EinsumHelper::ParseEquation()` always sets
  these flags."
