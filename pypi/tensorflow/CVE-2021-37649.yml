package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "NULL Pointer Dereference"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  The code for `tf.raw_ops.UncompressElement` can be made to trigger a null pointer
  dereference. The implementation obtains a pointer to a `CompressedElement` from
  a `Variant` tensor and then proceeds to dereference it for decompressing. There
  is no check that the `Variant` tensor contained a `CompressedElement`, so the pointer
  is actually `nullptr`."
