package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  Due to lack of validation in `tf.raw_ops.RaggedTensorToTensor`, an attacker can
  exploit an undefined behavior if input arguments are empty. The implementation only
  checks that one of the tensors is not empty, but does not check for the other ones."
