identifier: "CVE-2021-37651"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Out-of-bounds Write"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  The implementation for `tf.raw_ops.FractionalAvgPoolGrad` can be tricked into accessing
  data outside of bounds of heap allocated buffers. The implementation does not validate
  that the input tensor is non-empty. Thus, code constructs an empty `EigenDoubleMatrixMap`
  and then accesses this buffer with indices that are outside of the empty area."
