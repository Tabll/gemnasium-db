identifier: "CVE-2021-37657"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Access of Uninitialized Pointer"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  An attacker can cause undefined behavior via binding a reference to null pointer
  in all operations of type `tf.raw_ops.MatrixDiagV*`. The implementation has incomplete
  validation that the value of `k` is a valid tensor. We have check that this value
  is either a scalar or a vector, but there is no check for the number of elements.
  If this is an empty tensor, then code that accesses the first element of the tensor
  is wrong."
