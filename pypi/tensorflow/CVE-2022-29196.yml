package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to
  versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.Conv3DBackpropFilterV2`
  does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which
  can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. The code does not validate that
  the `filter_sizes` argument is a vector. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4
  contain a patch for this issue."
