package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Out-of-bounds Write"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  If the `splits` argument of `RaggedBincount` does not specify a valid `SparseTensor`,
  then an attacker can trigger a heap buffer overflow. This will cause a read from
  outside the bounds of the `splits` tensor buffer in the implementation of the `RaggedBincount`
  op. Before the `for` loop, `batch_idx` is set to The attacker sets `splits(0)` to
  be 7, hence the `while` loop does not execute and `batch_idx` remains This then
  results in writing to `out(-1, bin)`, which is before the heap allocated buffer
  for the output tensor."
