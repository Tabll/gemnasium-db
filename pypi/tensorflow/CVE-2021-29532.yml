identifier: "CVE-2021-29532"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Out-of-bounds Read"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  An attacker can force accesses outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays by passing
  in invalid tensor values to `tf.raw_ops.RaggedCross`. This is because the implementation
  lacks validation for the user supplied arguments. Each of the above branches call
  a helper function after accessing array elements via a `*_list[next_*]` pattern,
  followed by incrementing the `next_*` index. However, as there is no validation
  that the `next_*` values are in the valid range for the corresponding `*_list` arrays,
  this results in heap OOB reads."
