title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The `GraphDef`
  format in TensorFlow does not allow self recursive functions. The runtime assumes
  that this invariant is satisfied. However, a `GraphDef` containing a fragment such
  as the following can be consumed when loading a `SavedModel`. This would result
  in a stack overflow during execution as resolving each `NodeDef` means resolving
  the function itself and its nodes. The fix will be included in TensorFlow We will
  also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow, TensorFlow, and TensorFlow, as these
  are also affected and still in supported range."
