title: "Stack overflow in TensorFlow"
description: "The `GraphDef` format in TensorFlow does not allow self recursive functions.
  The runtime assumes that this invariant is satisfied. However, a `GraphDef` containing
  a fragment such as the following can be consumed when loading a `SavedModel`:\n\n```\nlibrary
  {\nfunction {\nsignature {\nname: \"SomeOp\"\ndescription: \"Self recursive op\"\n}\nnode_def
  {\nname: \"1\"\nop: \"SomeOp\"\n}\nnode_def {\nname: \"2\"\nop: \"SomeOp\"\n}\n}\n}\n```\n\nThis
  would result in a stack overflow during execution as resolving each `NodeDef` means
  resolving the function itself and its nodes."
