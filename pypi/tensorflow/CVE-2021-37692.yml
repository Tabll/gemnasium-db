identifier: "CVE-2021-37692"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  Go code can trigger a segfault in string deallocation. For string tensors, `C.TF_TString_Dealloc`
  is called during garbage collection within a finalizer function. However, tensor
  structure isn't checked until encoding to avoid a performance penalty. The current
  method for dealloc assumes that encoding succeeded, but segfaults when a string
  tensor is garbage collected whose encoding failed (e.g., due to mismatched dimensions).
  To fix this, the call to set the finalizer function is deferred until `NewTensor`
  returns and, if encoding failed for a string tensor, deallocs are determined based
  on bytes written."
