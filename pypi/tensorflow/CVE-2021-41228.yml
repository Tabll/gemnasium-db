title: "Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning.This can
  be used by attackers to run arbitrary code on the plaform where the CLI tool runs.
  However, given that the tool is always run manually, the impact of this is not severe.
  We have patched this by adding a `safe` flag which defaults to `True` and an explicit
  warning for users."
