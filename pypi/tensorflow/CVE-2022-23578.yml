title: "Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime"
description: "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. If a graph
  node is invalid, TensorFlow can leak memory in the implementation of `ImmutableExecutorState::Initialize`.
  Here, we set `item->kernel` to `nullptr` but it is a simple `OpKernel*` pointer
  so the memory that was previously allocated to it would leak. The fix will be included
  in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow, TensorFlow, and
  TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still in supported range."
