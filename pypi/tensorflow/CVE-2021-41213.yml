title: "Deadlock in mutually recursive `tf.function` objects"
description: "The [code behind `tf.function` API](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/python/eager/def_function.py#L542)
  can be made to deadlock when two `tf.function` decorated Python functions are mutually
  recursive:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n@tf.function()\ndef fun1(num):\nif
  num == 1:\nreturn\nprint(num)\nfun2(num-1)\n\n@tf.function()\ndef fun2(num):\nif
  num == 0:\nreturn\nprint(num)\nfun1(num-1)\n\nfun1(9)\n```\n\nThis occurs due to
  using a non-reentrant `Lock` Python object.\n\nLoading any model which contains
  mutually recursive functions is vulnerable. An attacker can cause denial of service
  by causing users to load such models and calling a recursive `tf.function`, although
  this is not a frequent scenario."
