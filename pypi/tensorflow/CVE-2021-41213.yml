package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Improper Locking"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning.This occurs
  due to using a non-reentrant `Lock` Python object. Loading any model which contains
  mutually recursive functions is vulnerable. An attacker can cause denial of service
  by causing users to load such models and calling a recursive `tf.function`, although
  this is not a frequent scenario."
