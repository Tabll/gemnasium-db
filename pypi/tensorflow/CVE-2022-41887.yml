title: "Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. `tf.keras.losses.poisson`
  receives a `y_pred` and `y_true` that are passed through `functor::mul` in `BinaryOp`.
  If the resulting dimensions overflow an `int32`, TensorFlow will crash due to a
  size mismatch during broadcast assignment. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
  c5b30379ba87cbe774b08ac50c1f6d36df4ebb7c. The fix will be included in TensorFlow
  2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1 and 2.9.3, as these
  are also affected and still in supported range. However, we will not cherrypick
  this commit into TensorFlow 2.8.x, as it depends on Eigen behavior that changed
  between 2.8 and 2.9."
