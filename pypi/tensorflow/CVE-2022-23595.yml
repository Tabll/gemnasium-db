title: "NULL Pointer Dereference"
description: "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. When building
  an XLA compilation cache, if default settings are used, TensorFlow triggers a null
  pointer dereference. In the default scenario, all devices are allowed, so `flr->config_proto`
  is `nullptr`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this
  commit on TensorFlow, TensorFlow, and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and
  still in supported range."
