identifier: "CVE-2021-29561"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Reachable Assertion"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  An attacker can cause a denial of service by exploiting a `CHECK`-failure coming
  from `tf.raw_ops.LoadAndRemapMatrix`. This is because the implementation assumes
  that the `ckpt_path` is always a valid scalar. However, an attacker can send any
  other tensor as the first argument of `LoadAndRemapMatrix`. This would cause the
  rank `CHECK` in `scalar<T>()()` to trigger and terminate the process."
