- "GHSA-5crj-c72x-m7gq"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "NULL Pointer Dereference"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning.This occurs
  because the code assumes that the first node in the pairing (e.g., an `Enter` node)
  always exists when encountering the second node (e.g., an `Exit` node). When this
  is not the case, `parent` is `nullptr` so dereferencing it causes a crash."
