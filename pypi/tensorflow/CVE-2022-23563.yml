package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere"
description: "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. In multiple
  places, TensorFlow uses `tempfile.mktemp` to create temporary files. While this
  is acceptable in testing, in utilities and libraries it is dangerous as a different
  process can create the file between the check for the filename in `mktemp` and the
  actual creation of the file by a subsequent operation (a TOC/TOU type of weakness).
  In several instances, TensorFlow was supposed to actually create a temporary directory
  instead of a file. This logic bug is hidden away by the `mktemp` function usage.
  We have patched the issue in several commits, replacing `mktemp` with the safer
  `mkstemp`/`mkdtemp` functions, according to the usage pattern. Users are advised
  to upgrade as soon as possible."
