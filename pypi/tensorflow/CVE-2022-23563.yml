package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Insecure temporary file in Tensorflow"
description: "In multiple places, TensorFlow uses `tempfile.mktemp` to create temporary
  files. While this is acceptable in testing, in utilities and libraries it is dangerous
  as a different process can create the file between the check for the filename in
  `mktemp` and the actual creation of the file by a subsequent operation (a TOC/TOU
  type of weakness).\n\nIn several instances, TensorFlow was supposed to actually
  create a temporary directory instead of a file. This logic bug is hidden away by
  the `mktemp` function usage."
