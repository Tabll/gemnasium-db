title: "Reachable Assertion"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  An attacker can cause a denial of service by exploiting a `CHECK`-failure coming
  from the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.RFFT`. Eigen code operating on an empty matrix
  can trigger on an assertion and will cause program termination."
