package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Out-of-bounds Read"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.MaxPoolGradWithArgmax` can cause reads outside
  of bounds of heap allocated data if attacker supplies specially crafted inputs.
  The implementation uses the same value to index in two different arrays but there
  is no guarantee that the sizes are identical."
