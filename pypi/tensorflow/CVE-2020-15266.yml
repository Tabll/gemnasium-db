title: "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer"
description: "In Tensorflow, when the `boxes` argument of `tf.image.crop_and_resize`
  has a very large value, the CPU kernel implementation receives it as a C++ `nan`
  floating point value. Attempting to operate on this is undefined behavior which
  later produces a segmentation fault."
