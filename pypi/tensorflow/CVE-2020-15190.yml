identifier: "CVE-2020-15190"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "NULL Pointer Dereference"
description: "In Tensorflow, the `tf.raw_ops.Switch` operation takes as input a tensor
  and a boolean and outputs two tensors. Depending on the boolean value, one of the
  tensors is exactly the input tensor whereas the other one should be an empty tensor.
  However, the eager runtime traverses all tensors in the output. Since only one of
  the tensors is defined, the other one is `nullptr`, hence we are binding a reference
  to `nullptr`. This is undefined behavior and reported as an error if compiling with
  `-fsanitize=null`."
