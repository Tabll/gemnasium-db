identifier: "CVE-2021-29534"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  An attacker can trigger a denial of service via a `CHECK`-fail in `tf.raw_ops.SparseConcat`.
  This is a legacy implementation of the constructor and operations should use `BuildTensorShapeBase`
  or `AddDimWithStatus` to prevent `CHECK`-failures in the presence of overflows."
