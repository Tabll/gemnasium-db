title: "Division by zero in TFLite's implementation of `GatherNd`"
description: "The reference implementation of the `GatherNd` TFLite operator is [vulnerable
  to a division by zero error](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0d45ea1ca641b21b73bcf9c00e0179cda284e7e7/tensorflow/lite/kernels/internal/reference/reference_ops.h#L966):\n\n```cc\nret.dims_to_count[i]
  = remain_flat_size / params_shape.Dims(i);\n```\n\nAn attacker can craft a model
  such that `params` input would be an empty tensor. In turn, `params_shape.Dims(.)`
  would be zero, in at least one dimension."
