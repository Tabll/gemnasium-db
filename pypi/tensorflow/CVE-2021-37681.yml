identifier: "CVE-2021-37681"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "NULL Pointer Dereference"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  The implementation of `SVDF` in `TFLite` is vulnerable to a null pointer error.
  The `GetVariableInput` function can return a null pointer but `GetTensorData` assumes
  that the argument is always a valid tensor. Furthermore, because `GetVariableInput`
  calls `GetMutableInput` which might return `nullptr`, the `tensor->is_variable`
  expression can also trigger a null pointer exception."
