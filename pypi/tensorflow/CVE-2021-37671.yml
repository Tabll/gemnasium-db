package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Access of Uninitialized Pointer"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  An attacker can cause undefined behavior via binding a reference to null pointer
  in `tf.raw_ops.Map*` and `tf.raw_ops.OrderedMap*` operations. The implementation
  has a check in place to ensure that `indices` is in ascending order, but does not
  check that `indices` is not empty. "
