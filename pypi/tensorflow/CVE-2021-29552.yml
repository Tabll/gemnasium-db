identifier: "CVE-2021-29552"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Reachable Assertion"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  An attacker can cause a denial of service by controlling the values of `num_segments`
  tensor argument for `UnsortedSegmentJoin`. This is because the implementation assumes
  that the `num_segments` tensor is a valid scalar. Since the tensor is empty the
  `CHECK` involved in `.scalar<T>()()` that checks that the number of elements is
  exactly 1 will be invalidated and this would result in process termination."
