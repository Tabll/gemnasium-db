title: "Archive spoofing vulnerability in borgbackup"
description: "A flaw in the cryptographic authentication scheme in borgbackup allowed
  an attacker to fake archives and potentially indirectly cause backup data loss in
  the repository.\n\nThe attack requires an attacker to be able to\n\n1. insert files
  (with no additional headers) into backups\n2. gain write access to the repository\n\nThis
  vulnerability does not disclose plaintext to the attacker, nor does it affect the
  authenticity of existing archives.\n\nCreating plausible fake archives may be feasible
  for empty or small archives, but is unlikely for large archives.\n\nAffected are
  all borgbackup releases prior to 1.2.5.\n\nNote: CVSS scoring model seemed to badly
  fit for this case, thus I manually set score to \"moderate\"."
