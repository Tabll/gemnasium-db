identifier: "CVE-2016-6580"
package_slug: "pypi/priority"
title: "DoS via Unlimited Stream Insertion"
description: "An HTTP/2 implementation built using the priority library could be targeted
  by a malicious peer by having that peer assign priority information for every possible
  HTTP/2 stream ID. The priority tree would happily continue to store the priority
  information for each stream, and would therefore allocate unbounded amounts of memory.
  Attempting to actually *use* a tree like this would also cause extremely high CPU
  usage to maintain the tree."
