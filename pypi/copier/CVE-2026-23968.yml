title: "Copier safe template has arbitrary filesystem read access via symlinks when
  _preserve_symlinks: false"
description: "Copier suggests that it's safe to generate a project from a safe template,
  i.e. one that doesn't use [unsafe](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuring/#unsafe)
  features like custom Jinja extensions which would require passing the `--UNSAFE,--trust`
  flag. As it turns out, a safe template can currently include arbitrary files/directories
  outside the local template clone location by using symlinks along with [`_preserve_symlinks:
  false`](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuring/#preserve_symlinks)
  (which is Copier's default setting).\n\nImagine, e.g., a malicious template author
  who creates a template that reads SSH keys or other secrets from well-known locations
  and hopes for a user to push the generated project to a public location like [github.com](https://github.com/)
  where the template author can extract the secrets.\n\nReproducible example:\n\n-
  Illegally include a file in the generated project via symlink resolution:\n\n```shell\necho
  \"s3cr3t\" > secret.txt\n\nmkdir src/\npushd src/\nln -s ../secret.txt stolen-secret.txt\npopd\n\nuvx
  copier copy src/ dst/\n\ncat dst/stolen-secret.txt"
