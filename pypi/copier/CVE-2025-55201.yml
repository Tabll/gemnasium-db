title: "Copier's safe template has arbitrary filesystem read/write access"
description: "Copier's current security model shall restrict filesystem access through
  Jinja:\n\n- Files can only be read using `{% include ... %}`, which is limited by
  Jinja to reading files from the subtree of the local template clone in our case.\n-
  Files are written in the destination directory according to their counterparts in
  the template.\n\nCopier suggests that it's safe to generate a project from a safe
  template, i.e. one that doesn't use [unsafe](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuring/#unsafe)
  features like custom Jinja extensions which would require passing the `--UNSAFE,--trust`
  flag. As it turns out, a safe template can currently read and write arbitrary files
  because we expose a few `pathlib.Path` objects in the Jinja context which have unconstrained
  I/O methods. This effectively renders our security model w.r.t. filesystem access
  useless."
