package_slug: "pypi/copier"
title: "Copier's safe template has filesystem write access outside destination path"
description: "Copier suggests that it's safe to generate a project from a safe template,
  i.e. one that doesn't use [unsafe](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuring/#unsafe)
  features like custom Jinja extensions which would require passing the `--UNSAFE,--trust`
  flag. As it turns out, a safe template can currently write files outside the destination
  path where a project shall be generated or updated. This is possible when rendering
  a [generated directory structure](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuring/#generating-a-directory-structure)
  whose rendered path is either a relative parent path or an absolute path. Constructing
  such paths is possible using Copier's builtin `pathjoin` Jinja filter and its builtin
  `_copier_conf.sep` variable, which is the platform-native path separator. This way,
  a malicious template author can create a template that overwrites arbitrary files
  (according to the user's write permissions), e.g., to cause havoc."
