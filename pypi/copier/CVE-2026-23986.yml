title: "Copier safe template has arbitrary filesystem write access via directory symlinks
  when _preserve_symlinks: true "
description: "Copier suggests that it's safe to generate a project from a safe template,
  i.e. one that doesn't use [unsafe](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuring/#unsafe)
  features like custom Jinja extensions which would require passing the `--UNSAFE,--trust`
  flag. As it turns out, a safe template can currently write to arbitrary directories
  outside the destination path by using directory a symlink along with [`_preserve_symlinks:
  true`](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuring/#preserve_symlinks) and
  a [generated directory structure](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuring/#generating-a-directory-structure)
  whose rendered path is inside the symlinked directory. This way, a malicious template
  author can create a template that overwrites arbitrary files (according to the user's
  write permissions), e.g., to cause havoc.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> At the time of writing,
  the exploit is non-deterministic, as Copier walks the template's file tree using
  [`os.scandir`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.scandir) which yields
  directory entries in arbitrary order.\n\nReproducible example (may or may not work
  depending on directory entry yield order):\n\n```shell\nmkdir other/\npushd other/\necho
  \"sensitive\" > sensitive.txt\npopd\n\nmkdir src/\npushd src/\nln -s ../other other\necho
  \"overwritten\" > \"{{ pathjoin('other', 'sensitive.txt') }}.jinja\"\necho \"_preserve_symlinks:
  true\" > copier.yml\ntree ."
