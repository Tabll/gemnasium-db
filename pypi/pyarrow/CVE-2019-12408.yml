title: "Missing Initialization of Resource in Apache Arrow"
description: "It was discovered that the C++ implementation (which underlies the R,
  Python and Ruby implementations) of Apache Arrow 0.14.0 to 0.14.1 had a uninitialized
  memory bug when building arrays with null values in some cases. This can lead to
  uninitialized memory being unintentionally shared if Arrow Arrays are transmitted
  over the wire (for instance with Flight) or persisted in the streaming IPC and file
  formats."
