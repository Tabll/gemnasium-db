title: "PyArrow: Arbitrary code execution when loading a malicious data file"
description: "Deserialization of untrusted data in IPC and Parquet readers in PyArrow
  versions 0.14.0 to 14.0.0 allows arbitrary code execution. An application is vulnerable
  if it reads Arrow IPC, Feather or Parquet data from untrusted sources (for example
  user-supplied input files).\n\nThis vulnerability only affects PyArrow, not other
  Apache Arrow implementations or bindings.\n\nIt is recommended that users of PyArrow
  upgrade to 14.0.1. Similarly, it is recommended that downstream libraries upgrade
  their dependency requirements to PyArrow 14.0.1 or later. PyPI packages are already
  available, and we hope that conda-forge packages will be available soon.\n\nIf it
  is not possible to upgrade, maintainers provide a separate package `pyarrow-hotfix`
  that disables the vulnerability on older PyArrow versions. See https://pypi.org/project/pyarrow-hotfix/
  \ for instructions."
