title: "A single post-release of dydx-v4-client contained obfuscated multi-stage loader"
description: "A PyPI user account compromised by an attacker and was able to upload
  a malicious version (1.1.5.post1) of the `dydx-v4-client` package. This version
  contains a highly obfuscated multi-stage loader that ultimately executes malicious
  code on the host system.\n\nWhile the final payload is not visible because it is
  tucked away inside 100 layers of encoding, the structural design—specifically the
  use of recursive decompression followed by an `exec()` call is a definitive indicator
  of malicious software, likely a \"Crypter\" or \"Dropper\" masquerading as a cryptocurrency-related
  utility with the intent on connecting to hxxps://dydx[.]priceoracle[.]site/py\nto
  download and execute further payloads.\n\nUsers of the `dydx-v4-client` package
  should immediately uninstall version 1.1.5.post1and revert to the last known good
  version (1.1.5) or later secure versions once available. Additionally, users should
  monitor their systems for any unusual activity and consider running security scans
  to detect any potential compromise."
