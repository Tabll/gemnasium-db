title: "Twisted vulnerable to NameVirtualHost Host header injection"
description: "Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications. Started
  with version 0.9.4, when the host header does not match a configured host `twisted.web.vhost.NameVirtualHost`
  will return a `NoResource` resource which renders the Host header unescaped into
  the 404 response allowing HTML and script injection. In practice this should be
  very difficult to exploit as being able to modify the Host header of a normal HTTP
  request implies that one is already in a privileged position. This issue was fixed
  in version 22.10.0rc1. There are no known workarounds."
