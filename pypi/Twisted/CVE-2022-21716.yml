title: "Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')"
description: "Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications, supporting
  Python 3.6+. Prior to 22.2.0, Twisted SSH client and server implement is able to
  accept an infinite amount of data for the peer's SSH version identifier. This ends
  up with a buffer using all the available memory. The attach is a simple as `nc -rv
  localhost 22 < /dev/zero`. A patch is available in version 22.2.0. There are currently
  no known workarounds."
