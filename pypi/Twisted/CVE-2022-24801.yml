package_slug: "pypi/Twisted"
title: "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests in twisted.web"
description: "The Twisted Web HTTP 1.1 server, located in the `twisted.web.http` module,
  parsed several HTTP request constructs more leniently than permitted by RFC 7230:\n\n1.
  The Content-Length header value could have a `+` or `-` prefix.\n2. Illegal characters
  were permitted in chunked extensions, such as the LF (`\\n`) character.\n3. Chunk
  lengths, which are expressed in hexadecimal format, could have a prefix of `0x`.\n4.
  HTTP headers were stripped of all leading and trailing ASCII whitespace, rather
  than only space and HTAB (`\\t`).\n\nThis non-conformant parsing can lead to desync
  if requests pass through multiple HTTP parsers, potentially resulting in HTTP request
  smuggling."
