package_slug: "pypi/Twisted"
title: "twisted.web has disordered HTTP pipeline response"
description: "Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications. Prior
  to version 23.10.0rc1, when sending multiple HTTP requests in one TCP packet, twisted.web
  will process the requests asynchronously without guaranteeing the response order.
  If one of the endpoints is controlled by an attacker, the attacker can delay the
  response on purpose to manipulate the response of the second request when a victim
  launched two requests using HTTP pipeline. Version 23.10.0rc1 contains a patch for
  this issue."
