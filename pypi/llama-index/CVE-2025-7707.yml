- "GHSA-rg9h-vx28-xxp5"
package_slug: "pypi/llama-index"
title: "llama-index has Insecure Temporary File"
description: "The llama_index library version 0.12.33 sets the NLTK data directory
  to a subdirectory of the codebase by default, which is world-writable in multi-user
  environments. This configuration allows local users to overwrite, delete, or corrupt
  NLTK data files, leading to potential denial of service, data tampering, or privilege
  escalation. The vulnerability arises from the use of a shared cache directory instead
  of a user-specific one, making it susceptible to local data tampering and denial
  of service."
