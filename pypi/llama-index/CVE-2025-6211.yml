title: "LlamaIndex vulnerable to data loss through hash collisions in its DocugamiReader
  class "
description: "A vulnerability in the DocugamiReader class of the run-llama/llama_index
  repository, up to but excluding version 0.12.41, involves the use of MD5 hashing
  to generate IDs for document chunks. This approach leads to hash collisions when
  structurally distinct chunks contain identical text, resulting in one chunk overwriting
  another. This can cause loss of semantically or legally important document content,
  breakage of parent-child chunk hierarchies, and inaccurate or hallucinated responses
  in AI outputs. The issue is resolved in version 0.3.1."
