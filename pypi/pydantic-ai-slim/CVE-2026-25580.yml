title: "Pydantic AI has Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in URL Download Handling"
description: "A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in Pydantic
  AI's URL download functionality. When applications accept message history from untrusted
  sources, attackers can include malicious URLs that cause the server to make HTTP
  requests to internal network resources, potentially accessing internal services
  or cloud credentials.\n\n**This vulnerability only affects applications that accept
  message history from external users**, such as those using:\n- **`Agent.to_web`**
  or **`clai web`** to serve a chat interface\n- **`VercelAIAdapter`** for Vercel
  AI SDK integration\n- **`AGUIAdapter`** or **`Agent.to_ag_ui`** for AG-UI protocol
  integration\n- Custom APIs that accept message history from user input\n\nApplications
  that only use hardcoded or developer-controlled URLs are not affected."
