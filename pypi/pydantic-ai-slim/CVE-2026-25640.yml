title: "Pydantic AI has Stored XSS via Path Traversal in Web UI CDN URL"
description: "A Path Traversal vulnerability in the [Pydantic AI web UI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/web/)
  allows an attacker to serve arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the application
  by crafting a malicious URL. If a victim clicks the link or visits it via an iframe,
  attacker-controlled code executes in their browser, enabling theft of chat history
  and other client-side data.\n\n**This vulnerability only affects applications that
  use:**\n- **`Agent.to_web`** to serve a chat interface\n- **`clai web`** to serve
  a chat interface from the CLI\n\nThese are typically run locally (on `localhost`),
  but may also be deployed on a remote server."
