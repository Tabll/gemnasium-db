title: "Path Traversal in django-s3file"
description: "It was possible to traverse the entire AWS S3 bucket and in most cases
  to access or delete files.\nThe issue was discovered by the maintainer. There were
  no reports of the vulnerability\nbeing known to or exploited by a third party, before
  the release of the patch.\n\nIf the `AWS_LOCATION` setting was set, traversal was
  limited to that location only.\nIf all your files handling views (like form views)
  require authentication or special permission, the thread is limited to privileged
  users."
