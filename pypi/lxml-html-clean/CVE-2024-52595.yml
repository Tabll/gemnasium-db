identifiers:
- "CVE-2024-52595"
- "GHSA-5jfw-gq64-q45f"
package_slug: "pypi/lxml-html-clean"
title: "HTML Cleaner allows crafted scripts in special contexts like svg or math to
  pass through"
description: "The HTML Parser in lxml does not properly handle context-switching for
  special HTML tags such as `<svg>`, `<math>` and `<noscript>`. This behavior deviates
  from how web browsers parse and interpret such tags. Specifically, content in CSS
  comments is ignored by lxml_html_clean but may be interpreted differently by web
  browsers, enabling malicious scripts to bypass the cleaning process. This vulnerability
  could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, compromising the security of users
  relying on lxml_html_clean in default configuration for sanitizing untrusted HTML
  content."
