package_slug: "pypi/pyOpenSSL"
title: "Pyopenssl Incorrect Memory Management"
description: "It was discovered that pyOpenSSL incorrectly handled memory when performing
  operations on a PKCS #12 store. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue
  to cause pyOpenSSL to consume resources, resulting in a denial of service.\n\nThis
  attack appear to be exploitable via Depends upon calling application, however it
  could be as simple as initiating a TLS connection that would cause the calling application
  to reload certificates from a PKCS #12 store. This vulnerability appears to have
  been fixed in 17.5.0."
