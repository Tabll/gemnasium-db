description: "It was discovered that pyOpenSSL incorrectly handled memory when handling
  X509 objects. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause pyOpenSSL to crash,
  resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This attack
  appears to be exploitable via Depends on the calling application and if it retains
  a reference to the memory. This vulnerability appears to have been fixed in 17.5.0."
