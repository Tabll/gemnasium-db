title: "Hugging Face Text Generation Inference vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource
  Consumption"
description: "A vulnerability in huggingface/text-generation-inference version 3.3.6
  allows unauthenticated remote attackers to exploit unbounded external image fetching
  during input validation in VLM mode. The issue arises when the router scans inputs
  for Markdown image links and performs a blocking HTTP GET request, reading the entire
  response body into memory and cloning it before decoding. This behavior can lead
  to resource exhaustion, including network bandwidth saturation, memory inflation,
  and CPU overutilization. The vulnerability is triggered even if the request is later
  rejected for exceeding token limits. The default deployment configuration, which
  lacks memory usage limits and authentication, exacerbates the impact, potentially
  crashing the host machine. The issue is resolved in version 3.3.7."
