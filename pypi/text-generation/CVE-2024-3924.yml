title: "code injection vulnerability exists in the huggingface/text-generation-inference
  repository"
description: "A code injection vulnerability exists in the huggingface/text-generation-inference
  repository, specifically within the `autodocs.yml` workflow file. The vulnerability
  arises from the insecure handling of the `github.head_ref` user input, which is
  used to dynamically construct a command for installing a software package. An attacker
  can exploit this by forking the repository, creating a branch with a malicious payload
  as the name, and then opening a pull request to the base repository. Successful
  exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the GitHub
  Actions runner. This issue affects versions up to and including v2.0.0 and was fixed
  in version 2.0.0."
