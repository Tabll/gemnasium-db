title: "Duplicate Advisory: Reflected cross-site scripting issue in Datasette"
description: "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-xw7c-jx9m-xh5g. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n## Original Description\nDatasette is an open source multi-tool for
  exploring and publishing data. The `?_trace=1` debugging feature in Datasette does
  not correctly escape generated HTML, resulting in a [reflected cross-site scripting](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/#reflected-xss-attacks)
  vulnerability. This vulnerability is particularly relevant if your Datasette installation
  includes authenticated features using plugins such as [datasette-auth-passwords](https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-auth-passwords)
  as an attacker could use the vulnerability to access protected data. Datasette 0.57
  and 0.56.1 both include patches for this issue. If you run Datasette behind a proxy
  you can workaround this issue by rejecting any incoming requests with `?_trace=`
  or `&_trace=` in their query string parameters."
