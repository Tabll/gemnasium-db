title: "Scrapy denial of service vulnerability"
description: "Scrapy 1.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
  consumption) via large files because arbitrarily many files are read into memory,
  which is especially problematic if the files are then individually written in a
  separate thread to a slow storage resource, as demonstrated by interaction between
  dataReceived (in core/downloader/handlers/http11.py) and S3FilesStore."
