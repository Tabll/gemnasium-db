identifier: "CVE-2017-14158"
package_slug: "pypi/scrapy"
title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "Scrapy allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
  consumption) via large files because arbitrarily many files are read into memory,
  which is especially problematic if the files are then individually written in a
  separate thread to a slow storage resource, as demonstrated by interaction between
  `dataReceived` (in `core/downloader/handlers/http11.py`) and S3FilesStore."
