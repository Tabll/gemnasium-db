title: "Duplicate Advisory: Scrapy leaks the authorization header on same-domain but
  cross-origin redirects "
description: "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-4qqq-9vqf-3h3f. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n## Original Description\nIn scrapy/scrapy, an issue was identified
  where the Authorization header is not removed during redirects that only change
  the scheme (e.g., HTTPS to HTTP) but remain within the same domain. This behavior
  contravenes the Fetch standard, which mandates the removal of Authorization headers
  in cross-origin requests when the scheme, host, or port changes. Consequently, when
  a redirect downgrades from HTTPS to HTTP, the Authorization header may be inadvertently
  exposed in plaintext, leading to potential sensitive information disclosure to unauthorized
  actors. The flaw is located in the _build_redirect_request function of the redirect
  middleware."
