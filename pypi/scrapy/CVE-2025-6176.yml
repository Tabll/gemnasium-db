title: "Scrapy with Brotli is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack due to
  decompression"
description: "Brotli versions up to 1.1.0 are vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS)
  attack due to decompression. This issue has been patched in Brotli version 1.2.0.\n\nAdditionally,
  this affects users who implement the Brotli decompression with Scrapy versions up
  to 2.13.2, leaving them vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack. The protection
  mechanism against decompression bombs fails to mitigate the brotli variant, allowing
  remote servers to crash clients with less than 80GB of available memory. This occurs
  because brotli can achieve extremely high compression ratios for zero-filled data,
  leading to excessive memory consumption during decompression."
