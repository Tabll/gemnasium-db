title: "Scrapy is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack due to flaws in brotli
  decompression implementation"
description: "Scrapy versions up to 2.13.3 are vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS)
  attack due to a flaw in its brotli decompression implementation. The protection
  mechanism against decompression bombs fails to mitigate the brotli variant, allowing
  remote servers to crash clients with less than 80GB of available memory. This occurs
  because brotli can achieve extremely high compression ratios for zero-filled data,
  leading to excessive memory consumption during decompression. Mitigation for this
  vulnerability needs security enhancement added in brotli v1.2.0."
