title: "Scrapy before v2.6.2 and v1.8.3 vulnerable to one proxy sending credentials
  to another"
description: "Because of request retries and redirects, the same request can be
  processed by downloader middlewares more than once, including both the built-in
  HTTP proxy downloader middleware and any third-party proxy-rotation downloader middleware. 
  These third-party proxy-rotation downloader middlewares could change the `proxy` metadata
  of a request to a new value, but fail to remove the `Proxy-Authentication` header
  from the previous value of the `proxy` metadata, causing the credentials of one
  proxy to be leaked to a different proxy."
