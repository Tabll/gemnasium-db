title: "Duplicate Advisory: Scrapy authorization header leakage on cross-domain redirect"
description: "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-cw9j-q3vf-hrrv. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n## Original Description\nIn scrapy versions before 2.11.1, an issue
  was identified where the Authorization header, containing credentials for server
  authentication, is leaked to a third-party site during a cross-domain redirect.
  This vulnerability arises from the failure to remove the Authorization header when
  redirecting across domains. The exposure of the Authorization header to unauthorized
  actors could potentially allow for account hijacking."
