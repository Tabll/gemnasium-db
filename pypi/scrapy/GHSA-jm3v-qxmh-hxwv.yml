title: "Scrapy's redirects ignoring scheme-specific proxy settings"
description: "When using system proxy settings, which are scheme-specific (i.e. specific
  to `http://` or `https://` URLs), Scrapy was not accounting for scheme changes during
  redirects.\n\nFor example, an HTTP request would use the proxy configured for HTTP
  and, when redirected to an HTTPS URL, the new HTTPS request would still use the
  proxy configured for HTTP instead of switching to the proxy configured for HTTPS.
  Same the other way around.\n\nIf you have different proxy configurations for HTTP
  and HTTPS in your system for security reasons (e.g., maybe you donâ€™t want one of
  your proxy providers to be aware of the URLs that you visit with the other one),
  this would be a security issue."
