title: "MoinMoin Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities"
description: "Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in MoinMoin 1.5.8
  and earlier allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via (1)
  certain input processed by `formatter/text_gedit.py` (aka the gui editor formatter);
  (2) a page name, which triggers an injection in PageEditor.py when the page is successfully
  deleted by a victim in a DeletePage action; or (3) the destination page name for
  a RenamePage action, which triggers an injection in PageEditor.py when a victim's
  rename attempt fails because of a duplicate name.  NOTE: the AttachFile XSS issue
  is already covered by CVE-2008-0781, and the login XSS issue is already covered
  by CVE-2008-0780.\nThe issue has been fixed on [d0152eeb4499](http://hg.moinmo.in/moin/1.5/rev/d0152eeb4499)
