title: "AWS SAM CLI Path Traversal allows file copy to local cache"
description: "The [AWS Serverless Application Model Command Line Interface (AWS SAM
  CLI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/using-sam-cli.html)
  is an open-source CLI tool that helps Lambda developers to build and develop Lambda
  applications locally on their computers using Docker.\n\nAfter completing a build
  with AWS SAM CLI which include symlinks, the content of those symlinks are copied
  to the cache of the local workspace as regular files or directories. As a result,
  a user who does not have access to those symlinks outside of the Docker container
  would now have access via the local workspace.\n\nUsers should [upgrade to v1.134.0
  or newer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/manage-sam-cli-versions.html#manage-sam-cli-versions-upgrade)
  and ensure any forked or derivative code is patched to incorporate the new fixes.
  After upgrading, users must re-build their applications using the `sam build --use-container`
  to update the symlinks."
