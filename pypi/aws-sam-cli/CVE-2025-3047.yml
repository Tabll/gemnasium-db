title: "AWS SAM CLI Path Traversal allows file copy to build container"
description: "The [AWS Serverless Application Model Command Line Interface (AWS SAM
  CLI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/using-sam-cli.html)
  is an open-source CLI tool that helps Lambda developers to build and develop Lambda
  applications locally on their computers using Docker.\n\nWhen running the AWS SAM
  CLI build process with Docker and symlinks are included in the build files, the
  container environment allows a user to access privileged files on the host by leveraging
  the elevated permissions granted to the tool. A user could leverage the elevated
  permissions to access restricted files via symlinks and copy them to a more permissive
  location on the container.\n\nUsers should [upgrade to v1.133.0](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/manage-sam-cli-versions.html#manage-sam-cli-versions-upgrade)
  or newer and ensure any forked or derivative code is patched to incorporate the
  new fixes."
