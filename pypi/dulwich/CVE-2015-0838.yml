title: "Buffer Overflow when handling pack files"
description: "Dulwich contains an overflow condition in the py_apply_delta() function
  in _pack.c. The issue is triggered as user-supplied input is not properly validated
  when handling pack files. This may allow a context-dependent attacker to cause a
  buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service or potentially allowing the execution
  of arbitrary code."
