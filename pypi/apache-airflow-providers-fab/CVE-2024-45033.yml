title: "Apache Airflow Fab Provider Insufficient Session Expiration vulnerability"
description: "Insufficient Session Expiration vulnerability in Apache Airflow Fab
  Provider.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Airflow Fab Provider: before 1.5.2.\n\nWhen
  user password has been changed with admin CLI, the sessions for that user have not
  been cleared, leading to insufficient session expiration, thus logged users could
  continue to be logged in even after the password was changed. This only happened
  when the password was changed with CLI. The problem does not happen in case change
  was done with webserver thus this is different from [CVE-2023-40273](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pm87-24wq-r8w9) which
  was addressed in Apache-Airflow 2.7.0\n\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version
  1.5.2, which fixes the issue."
