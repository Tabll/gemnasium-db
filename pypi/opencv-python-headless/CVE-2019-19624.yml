title: "Out-of-bounds Read"
description: "An out-of-bounds read was discovered in OpenCV Specifically, variable
  coarsest_scale is assumed to be greater than or equal to finest_scale within the
  calc()/ocl_calc() functions in dis_flow.cpp. However, this is not true when dealing
  with small images, leading to an out-of-bounds read of the heap-allocated arrays
  Ux and Uy."
