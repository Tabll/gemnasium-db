title: "Python-RSA decryption of ciphertext leads to DoS"
description: "Python-RSA before 4.1 ignores leading '\\0' bytes during decryption
  of ciphertext. This could conceivably have a security-relevant impact, e.g., by
  helping an attacker to infer that an application uses Python-RSA, or if the length
  of accepted ciphertext affects application behavior (such as by causing excessive
  memory allocation)."
date: "2024-10-21"
pubdate: "2021-03-24"
affected_range: "<4.1"
fixed_versions:
- "4.1"
affected_versions: "All versions before 4.1"
not_impacted: "All versions starting from 4.1"
