identifier: "CVE-2020-13757"
package_slug: "pypi/rsa"
title: "Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm"
description: "Python-RSA ignores leading `\\0` bytes during decryption of ciphertext.
  This could conceivably have a security-relevant impact, e.g., by helping an attacker
  to infer that an application uses Python-RSA, or if the length of accepted ciphertext
  affects application behavior (such as by causing excessive memory allocation)."
