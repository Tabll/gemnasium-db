title: "Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File"
description: "`gradio` is an open source framework for building interactive machine
  learning models and demos. Prior to version 2.8.11, `gradio` suffers from Improper
  Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File. The `gradio` library has a flagging
  functionality which saves input/output data into a CSV file on the developer's computer.
  This can allow a user to save arbitrary text into the CSV file, such as commands.
  If a program like MS Excel opens such a file, then it automatically runs these commands,
  which could lead to arbitrary commands running on the user's computer. The problem
  has been patched as of `2.8.11`, which escapes the saved csv with single quotes.
  As a workaround, avoid opening csv files generated by `gradio` with Excel or similar
  spreadsheet programs."
