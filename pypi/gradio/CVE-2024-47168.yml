title: "In Gradio, the `enable_monitoring` flag set to `False` does not disable monitoring"
description: "What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?\n\nThis vulnerability
  involves data exposure due to the enable_monitoring flag not properly disabling
  monitoring when set to False. Even when monitoring is supposedly disabled, an attacker
  or unauthorized user can still access the monitoring dashboard by directly requesting
  the /monitoring endpoint. This means that sensitive application analytics may still
  be exposed, particularly in environments where monitoring is expected to be disabled.
  Users who set enable_monitoring=False to prevent unauthorized access to monitoring
  data are impacted."
