title: "Gradio's CORS origin validation accepts the null origin"
description: "**What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?**\n\nThis vulnerability
  relates to **CORS origin validation accepting a null origin**. When a Gradio server
  is deployed locally, the `localhost_aliases` variable includes \"null\" as a valid
  origin. This allows attackers to make unauthorized requests from sandboxed iframes
  or other sources with a null origin, potentially leading to data theft, such as
  user authentication tokens or uploaded files. This impacts users running Gradio
  locally, especially those using basic authentication."
