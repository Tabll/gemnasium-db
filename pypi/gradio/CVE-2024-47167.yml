title: "Gradio vulnerable to SSRF in the path parameter of /queue/join"
description: "**What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?**\n\nThis vulnerability
  relates to **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** in the `/queue/join` endpoint.
  Gradioâ€™s `async_save_url_to_cache` function allows attackers to force the Gradio
  server to send HTTP requests to user-controlled URLs. This could enable attackers
  to target internal servers or services within a local network and possibly exfiltrate
  data or cause unwanted internal requests. Additionally, the content from these URLs
  is stored locally, making it easier for attackers to upload potentially malicious
  files to the server. This impacts users deploying Gradio servers that use components
  like the Video component which involve URL fetching."
