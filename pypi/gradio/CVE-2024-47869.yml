package_slug: "pypi/gradio"
title: "Gradio performs a non-constant-time comparison when comparing hashes"
description: "**What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?**\n\nThis vulnerability
  involves a **timing attack** in the way Gradio compares hashes for the `analytics_dashboard`
  function. Since the comparison is not done in constant time, an attacker could exploit
  this by measuring the response time of different requests to infer the correct hash
  byte-by-byte. This can lead to unauthorized access to the analytics dashboard, especially
  if the attacker can repeatedly query the system with different keys."
