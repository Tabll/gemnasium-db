title: "Gradio's dropdown component pre-process step does not limit the values to
  those in the dropdown list"
description: "**What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?**\n\nThis vulnerability
  is a **data validation issue** in the Gradio `Dropdown` component's pre-processing
  step. Even if the `allow_custom_value` parameter is set to `False`, attackers can
  bypass this restriction by sending custom requests with arbitrary values, effectively
  breaking the developerâ€™s intended input constraints. While this alone is not a severe
  vulnerability, it can lead to more critical security issues, particularly when paired
  with other vulnerabilities like file downloads from the user's machine."
