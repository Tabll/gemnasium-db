package_slug: "pypi/gradio"
title: "Gradio's `is_in_or_equal` function may be bypassed"
description: "**What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?**\n\nThis vulnerability
  relates to the **bypass of directory traversal checks** within the `is_in_or_equal`
  function. This function, intended to check if a file resides within a given directory,
  can be bypassed with certain payloads that manipulate file paths using `..` (parent
  directory) sequences. Attackers could potentially access restricted files if they
  are able to exploit this flaw, although the difficulty is high. This primarily impacts
  users relying on Gradioâ€™s blocklist or directory access validation, particularly
  when handling file uploads."
