title: "Duplicate Advisory: Cross-Site Request Forgery in Gradio"
description: "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-48cq-79qq-6f7x. this link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n## Original Description\nA Cross-Site Request Forgery gives attackers
  the ability to upload many large files to a victim, if they are running Gradio locally.
  To resolve this a PR tightening the CORS rules around Gradio applications has been
  submitted. In particular, it checks to see if the host header is localhost (or one
  of its aliases) and if so, it requires the origin header (if present) to be localhost
  (or one of its aliases) as well."
