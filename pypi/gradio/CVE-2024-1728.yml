title: "Gradio Local File Inclusion vulnerability"
description: "gradio-app/gradio is vulnerable to a local file inclusion vulnerability
  due to improper validation of user-supplied input in the UploadButton component.
  Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files on the filesystem,
  such as private SSH keys, by manipulating the file path in the request to the `/queue/join`
  endpoint. This issue could potentially lead to remote code execution. The vulnerability
  is present in the handling of file upload paths, allowing attackers to redirect
  file uploads to unintended locations on the server."
