package_slug: "pypi/gradio"
title: "Gradio has a race condition in update_root_in_config may redirect user traffic"
description: "**What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?**\n\nThis vulnerability
  involves a **race condition** in the `update_root_in_config` function, allowing
  an attacker to modify the `root` URL used by the Gradio frontend to communicate
  with the backend. By exploiting this flaw, an attacker can redirect user traffic
  to a malicious server. This could lead to the interception of sensitive data such
  as authentication credentials or uploaded files. This impacts all users who connect
  to a Gradio server, especially those exposed to the internet, where malicious actors
  could exploit this race condition."
