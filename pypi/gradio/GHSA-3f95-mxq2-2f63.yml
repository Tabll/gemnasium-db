title: "Duplicate Advisory: Gradio Local File Inclusion vulnerability"
description: "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-m842-4qm8-7gpq. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n## Original Description\ngradio-app/gradio is vulnerable to a local
  file inclusion vulnerability due to improper validation of user-supplied input in
  the UploadButton component. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary
  files on the filesystem, such as private SSH keys, by manipulating the file path
  in the request to the `/queue/join` endpoint. This issue could potentially lead
  to remote code execution. The vulnerability is present in the handling of file upload
  paths, allowing attackers to redirect file uploads to unintended locations on the
  server."
