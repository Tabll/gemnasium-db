package_slug: "pypi/gradio"
title: "gradio vulnerable to Path Traversal"
description: "An issue was discovered in gradio-app/gradio, where the `/component_server`
  endpoint improperly allows the invocation of any method on a `Component` class with
  attacker-controlled arguments. Specifically, by exploiting the `move_resource_to_block_cache()`
  method of the `Block` class, an attacker can copy any file on the filesystem to
  a temporary directory and subsequently retrieve it. This vulnerability enables unauthorized
  local file read access, posing a significant risk especially when the application
  is exposed to the internet via `launch(share=True)`, thereby allowing remote attackers
  to read files on the host machine. Furthermore, gradio apps hosted on `huggingface.co`
  are also affected, potentially leading to the exposure of sensitive information
  such as API keys and credentials stored in environment variables."
