package_slug: "pypi/gradio"
title: "Update share links to use FRP instead of SSH tunneling"
description: "This is a vulnerability which affects anyone using Gradio's share links
  (i.e. creating a Gradio app and then setting `share=True`) with Gradio versions
  older than 3.13.1. In these older versions of Gradio, a private SSH key is sent
  to any user that connects to the Gradio machine, which means that a user could access
  other users' shared Gradio demos. From there, other exploits are possible depending
  on the level of access/exposure the Gradio app provides."
