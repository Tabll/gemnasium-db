title: "Server-Side Request Forgery in gradio"
description: "A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the gradio-app/gradio
  and was discovered in version 4.21.0, specifically within the `/queue/join` endpoint
  and the `save_url_to_cache` function. The vulnerability arises when the `path` value,
  obtained from the user and expected to be a URL, is used to make an HTTP request
  without sufficient validation checks. This flaw allows an attacker to send crafted
  requests that could lead to unauthorized access to the local network or the AWS
  metadata endpoint, thereby compromising the security of internal servers."
