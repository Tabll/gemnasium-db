title: "Gradio apps vulnerable to timing attacks to guess password"
description: "### Impact\nThis security policy is with regards to a timing attack
  that allows users of Gradio apps to potentially guess the password of password-protected
  Gradio apps. This relies on the fact that string comparisons in Python terminate
  early, as soon as there is a string mismatch. Because Gradio apps are, by default,
  not rate-limited, a user could brute-force millions of guesses to figure out the
  correct username and password.\n\n### Patches\nYes, the problem has been patched
  in Gradio version 4.19.2 or higher. We have no knowledge of this exploit being used
  against users of Gradio applications, but we encourage all users to upgrade to Gradio
  4.19.2 or higher.\n\nFixed in: https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/commit/e329f1fd38935213fe0e73962e8cbd5d3af6e87b"
