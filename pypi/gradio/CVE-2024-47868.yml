title: "Gradio has several components with post-process steps allow arbitrary file
  leaks"
description: "**What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?**\n\nThis is a
  **data validation vulnerability** affecting several Gradio components, which allows
  arbitrary file leaks through the post-processing step. Attackers can exploit these
  components by crafting requests that bypass expected input constraints. This issue
  could lead to sensitive files being exposed to unauthorized users, especially when
  combined with other vulnerabilities, such as issue TOB-GRADIO-15. The components
  most at risk are those that return or handle file data."
