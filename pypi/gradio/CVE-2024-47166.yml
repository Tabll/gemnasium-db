title: "Gradio has a one-level read path traversal in `/custom_component`"
description: "**What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?**\n\nThis vulnerability
  involves a **one-level read path traversal** in the `/custom_component` endpoint.
  Attackers can exploit this flaw to access and leak source code from custom Gradio
  components by manipulating the file path in the request. Although the traversal
  is limited to a single directory level, it could expose proprietary or sensitive
  code that developers intended to keep private. This impacts users who have developed
  custom Gradio components and are hosting them on publicly accessible servers."
