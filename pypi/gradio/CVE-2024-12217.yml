title: "Gradio Path Traversal vulnerability"
description: "A vulnerability in the gradio-app/gradio repository, version git 67e4044,
  allows for path traversal on Windows OS. The implementation of the blocked_path
  functionality, which is intended to disallow users from reading certain files, is
  flawed. Specifically, while the application correctly blocks access to paths like
  'C:/tmp/secret.txt', it fails to block access when using NTFS Alternate Data Streams
  (ADS) syntax, such as 'C:/tmp/secret.txt::$DATA'. This flaw can lead to unauthorized
  reading of blocked file paths."
