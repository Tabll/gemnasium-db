title: "Gradio Vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) via Crafted HTTP Request"
description: "A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists
  in the gradio-app/gradio repository, affecting the gr.Datetime component. The affected
  version is git commit 98cbcae. The vulnerability arises from the use of a regular
  expression `^(?:\\s*now\\s*(?:-\\s*(\\d+)\\s*([dmhs]))?)?\\s*$` to process user
  input. In Python's default regex engine, this regular expression can take polynomial
  time to match certain crafted inputs. An attacker can exploit this by sending a
  crafted HTTP request, causing the gradio process to consume 100% CPU and potentially
  leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition on the server."
