package_slug: "pypi/gradio"
title: "Files on the host computer can be accessed from the Gradio interface"
description: "This is a vulnerability that affects anyone who creates and publicly
  shares Gradio interfaces using `gradio<2.4.8`. Because of the way that static files
  were being served, someone who generated a public Gradio link and shared it with
  others would potentially be exposing the files on the computer that generated the
  link, while the link was active. An attacker would be able to view the contents
  of a file on the computer if they knew the exact relative filepath. We do not have
  any evidence that this was ever exploited, but we treated the issue seriously and
  immediately took steps to mitigate it (see below)"
