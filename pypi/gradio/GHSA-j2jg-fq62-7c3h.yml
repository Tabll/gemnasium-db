title: "Gradio Blocked Path ACL Bypass Vulnerability"
description: "Gradio's Access Control List (ACL) for file paths can be bypassed by
  altering the letter case of a blocked file or directory path. This vulnerability
  arises due to the lack of case normalization in the file path validation logic.
  On case-insensitive file systems, such as those used by Windows and macOS, this
  flaw enables attackers to circumvent security restrictions and access sensitive
  files that should be protected.\n\nThis issue can lead to unauthorized data access,
  exposing sensitive information and undermining the integrity of Gradio's security
  model. Given Gradio's popularity for building web applications, particularly in
  machine learning and AI, this vulnerability may pose a substantial threat if exploited
  in production environments."
