title: "Gradio has an XSS on every Gradio server via upload of HTML files, JS files,
  or SVG files"
description: "**What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?**\n\nThis vulnerability
  involves **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** on any Gradio server that allows file uploads.
  Authenticated users can upload files such as HTML, JavaScript, or SVG files containing
  malicious scripts. When other users download or view these files, the scripts will
  execute in their browser, allowing attackers to perform unauthorized actions or
  steal sensitive information from their sessions. This impacts any Gradio server
  that allows file uploads, particularly those using components that process or display
  user-uploaded files."
