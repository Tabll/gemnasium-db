title: "Gradio lacks integrity checking on the downloaded FRP client"
description: "This vulnerability is a **lack of integrity check** on the downloaded
  FRP client, which could potentially allow attackers to introduce malicious code.
  If an attacker gains access to the remote URL from which the FRP client is downloaded,
  they could modify the binary without detection, as the Gradio server does not verify
  the file's checksum or signature.\n\n**Who is impacted?**\nAny users utilizing the
  Gradio server's sharing mechanism that downloads the FRP client could be affected
  by this vulnerability, especially those relying on the executable binary for secure
  data tunneling."
