title: "Gradios's CORS origin validation is not performed when the request has a cookie"
description: "**What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?**\n\nThis vulnerability
  is related to **CORS origin validation**, where the Gradio server fails to validate
  the request origin when a cookie is present. This allows an attackerâ€™s website to
  make unauthorized requests to a local Gradio server. Potentially, attackers can
  upload files, steal authentication tokens, and access user data if the victim visits
  a malicious website while logged into Gradio. This impacts users who have deployed
  Gradio locally and use basic authentication."
