title: "llama-index-core vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "The `SimpleDirectoryReader` component in `llama_index.core` version
  0.12.23 suffers from uncontrolled memory consumption due to a resource management
  flaw. The vulnerability arises because the user-specified file limit (`num_files_limit`)
  is applied after all files in a directory are loaded into memory. This can lead
  to memory exhaustion and degraded performance, particularly in environments with
  limited resources. The issue is resolved in version 0.12.41."
