title: "LlamaIndex vulnerable to DoS attack through uncontrolled recursive JSON parsing"
description: "The JSONReader in run-llama/llama_index versions 0.12.28 is vulnerable
  to a stack overflow due to uncontrolled recursive JSON parsing. This vulnerability
  allows attackers to trigger a Denial of Service (DoS) by submitting deeply nested
  JSON structures, leading to a RecursionError and crashing applications. The root
  cause is the unsafe recursive traversal design and lack of depth validation, which
  makes the JSONReader susceptible to stack overflow when processing deeply nested
  JSON. This impacts the availability of services, making them unreliable and disrupting
  workflows. The issue is resolved in version 0.12.38."
