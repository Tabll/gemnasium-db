title: "LlamaIndex vulnerable to Path Traversal attack through its encode_image function"
description: "A path traversal vulnerability exists in run-llama/llama_index versions
  0.12.27 through 0.12.40, specifically within the `encode_image` function in `generic_utils.py`.
  This vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate the `image_path` input to read
  arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive system files. The issue arises
  due to improper validation or sanitization of the file path, enabling path traversal
  sequences to access files outside the intended directory. The vulnerability is fixed
  in version 0.12.41."
