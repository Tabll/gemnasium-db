title: "llama-index-core insecurely handles temporary files"
description: "The llama-index-core package, up to version 0.12.44, contains a vulnerability
  in the `get_cache_dir()` function where a predictable, hardcoded directory path
  `/tmp/llama_index` is used on Linux systems without proper security controls. This
  vulnerability allows attackers on multi-user systems to steal proprietary models,
  poison cached embeddings, or conduct symlink attacks. The issue affects all Linux
  deployments where multiple users share the same system. The vulnerability is classified
  under CWE-379, CWE-377, and CWE-367, indicating insecure temporary file creation
  and potential race conditions."
