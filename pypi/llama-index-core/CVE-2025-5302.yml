description: "A denial of service vulnerability exists in the JSONReader component
  of the run-llama/llama_index repository, specifically in version v0.12.37. The vulnerability
  is caused by uncontrolled recursion when parsing deeply nested JSON files, which
  can lead to Python hitting its maximum recursion depth limit. This results in high
