package_slug: "pypi/llama-index-core"
title: "llama-index-core Command Injection vulnerability"
description: "A command injection vulnerability exists in the run-llama/llama_index
  repository, specifically within the safe_eval function. Attackers can bypass the
  intended security mechanism, which checks for the presence of underscores in code
  generated by LLM, to execute arbitrary code. This is achieved by crafting input
  that does not contain an underscore but still results in the execution of OS commands.
  The vulnerability allows for remote code execution (RCE) on the server hosting the
  application."
