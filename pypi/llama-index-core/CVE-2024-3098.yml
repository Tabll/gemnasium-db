title: "llama-index-core Prompt Injection vulnerability leading to Arbitrary Code
  Execution"
description: "A vulnerability was identified in the `exec_utils` class of the `llama_index`
  package, specifically within the `safe_eval` function, allowing for prompt injection
  leading to arbitrary code execution. This issue arises due to insufficient validation
  of input, which can be exploited to bypass method restrictions and execute unauthorized
  code. The vulnerability is a bypass of the previously addressed CVE-2023-39662,
  demonstrated through a proof of concept that creates a file on the system by exploiting
  the flaw."
