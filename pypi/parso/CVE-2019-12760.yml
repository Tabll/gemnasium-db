title: "Deserialization vulnerability exists in parso"
description: "** DISPUTED ** A deserialization vulnerability exists in the way parso
  through 0.4.0 handles grammar parsing from the cache. Cache loading relies on pickle
  and, provided that an evil pickle can be written to a cache grammar file and that
  its parsing can be triggered, this flaw leads to Arbitrary Code Execution.  NOTE:
  This is disputed because \"the cache directory is not under control of the attacker
  in any common configuration.\""
