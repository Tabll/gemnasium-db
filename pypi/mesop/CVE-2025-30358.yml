title: "Mesop Class Pollution vulnerability leads to DoS and Jailbreak attacks"
description: "From @jackfromeast and @superboy-zjc:\nWe have identified a class pollution
  vulnerability in Mesop (<= [0.14.0](https://github.com/mesop-dev/mesop/releases/tag/v0.14.0))
  application that allows attackers to overwrite global variables and class attributes
  in certain Mesop modules during runtime. This vulnerability could directly lead
  to a denial of service (DoS) attack against the server. Additionally, it could also
  result in other severe consequences given the application's implementation, such
  as identity confusion, where an attacker could impersonate an assistant or system
  role within conversations. This impersonation could potentially enable jailbreak
  attacks when interacting with large language models (LLMs).\n\nJust like the Javascript's
  prototype pollution, this vulnerability could leave a way for attackers to manipulate
  the intended data-flow or control-flow of the application at runtime and lead to
  severe consequnces like RCE when gadgets are available."
