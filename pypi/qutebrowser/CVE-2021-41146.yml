package_slug: "pypi/qutebrowser"
title: "Arbitrary command execution on Windows via qutebrowserurl: URL handler"
description: "Starting with qutebrowser v1.7.0, the Windows installer for qutebrowser
  registers it as a handler for certain URL schemes. With some applications such as
  Outlook Desktop, opening a specially crafted URL can lead to argument injection,
  allowing execution of qutebrowser commands, which in turn allows arbitrary code
  execution via commands such as `:spawn` or `:debug-pyeval`.\n\nOnly Windows installs
  where qutebrowser is registered as URL handler are affected. It does *not* have
  to be set as default browser for the exploit to work."
