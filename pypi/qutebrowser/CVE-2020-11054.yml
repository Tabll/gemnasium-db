identifier: "CVE-2020-11054"
package_slug: "pypi/qutebrowser"
title: "UI Discrepancy for Security Feature"
description: "After a certificate error was overridden by the user, qutebrowser displays
  the URL as yellow (`colors.statusbar.url.warn.fg`). However, when the affected website
  was subsequently loaded again, the URL was mistakenly displayed as green 
  (`colors.statusbar.url.success_https`).
  While the user already has seen a certificate error prompt at this point (or set
  `content.ssl_strict` to `false`, which is not recommended), this could still provide
  a false sense of security."
