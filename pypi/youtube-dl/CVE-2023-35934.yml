title: "URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')"
description: "yt-dlp is a command-line program to download videos from video sites.
  During file downloads, yt-dlp or the external downloaders that yt-dlp employs may
  leak cookies on HTTP redirects to a different host, or leak them when the host for
  download fragments differs from their parent manifest's host. This vulnerable behavior
  is present in yt-dlp prior to 2023.07.06 and nightly 2023.07.06.185519. All native
  and external downloaders are affected, except for `curl` and `httpie` (version 3.1.0
  or later).\n\nAt the file download stage, all cookies are passed by yt-dlp to the
  file downloader as a `Cookie` header, thereby losing their scope. This also occurs
  in yt-dlp's info JSON output, which may be used by external tools. As a result,
  the downloader or external tool may indiscriminately send cookies with requests
  to domains or paths for which the cookies are not scoped.\n\nyt-dlp version 2023.07.06
  and nightly 2023.07.06.185519 fix this issue by removing the `Cookie` header upon
  HTTP redirects; having native downloaders calculate the `Cookie` header from the
  cookiejar, utilizing external downloaders' built-in support for cookies instead
  of passing them as header arguments, disabling HTTP redirectiong if the external
  downloader does not have proper cookie support, processing cookies passed as HTTP
  headers to limit their scope, and having a separate field for cookies in the info
  dict storing more information about scoping\n\nSome workarounds are available for
  those who are unable to upgrade. Avoid using cookies and user authentication methods.
  While extractors may set custom cookies, these usually do not contain sensitive
  information. Alternatively, avoid using `--load-info-json`. Or, if authentication
  is a must: verify the integrity of download links from unknown sources in browser
  (including redirects) before passing them to yt-dlp; use `curl` as external downloader,
  since it is not impacted; and/or avoid fragmented formats such as HLS/m3u8, DASH/mpd
  and ISM."
