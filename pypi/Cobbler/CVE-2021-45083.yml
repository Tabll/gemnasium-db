package_slug: "pypi/Cobbler"
title: "Incorrect Default Permissions in Cobbler"
description: "An issue was discovered in Cobbler before 3.3.1. Files in /etc/cobbler
  are world readable. Two of those files contain some sensitive information that can
  be exposed to a local user who has non-privileged access to the server. The users.digest
  file contains the sha2-512 digest of users in a Cobbler local installation. In the
  case of an easy-to-guess password, it's trivial to obtain the plaintext string.
  The settings.yaml file contains secrets such as the hashed default password."
