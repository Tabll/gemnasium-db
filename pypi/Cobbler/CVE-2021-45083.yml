package_slug: "pypi/Cobbler"
title: "Incorrect Default Permissions"
description: "An issue was discovered in Cobbler before 3.3.1. Files in /etc/cobbler
  are world readable. Two of those files contain some sensitive information that can
  be exposed to a local user who has non-privileged access to the server. The 
  `users.digest` file contains the `sha2-512` digest of users in a Cobbler local 
  installation. In the case of an easy-to-guess password, it's trivial to obtain the 
  plaintext string. The `settings.yaml` file contains secrets such as the hashed 
  default password."
