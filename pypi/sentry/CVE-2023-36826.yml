package_slug: "pypi/sentry"
title: "Incorrect Authorization"
description: "Sentry is an error tracking and performance monitoring platform. Starting
  in version 8.21.0 and prior to version 23.5.2, an authenticated user can download
  a debug or artifact bundle from arbitrary organizations and projects with a known
  bundle ID. The user does not need to be a member of the organization or have permissions
  on the project. A patch was issued in version 23.5.2 to ensure authorization checks
  are properly scoped on requests to retrieve debug or artifact bundles. Authenticated
  users who do not have the necessary permissions on the particular project are no
  longer able to download them. Sentry SaaS users do not need to take any action.
  Self-Hosted Sentry users should upgrade to version 23.5.2 or higher."
