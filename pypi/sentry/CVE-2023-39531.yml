package_slug: "pypi/sentry"
title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "Sentry is an error tracking and performance monitoring platform. Starting
  in version 10.0.0 and prior to version 23.7.2, an attacker with sufficient client-side
  exploits could retrieve a valid access token for another user during the OAuth token
  exchange due to incorrect credential validation. The client ID must be known and
  the API application must have already been authorized on the targeted user account.
  Sentry SaaS customers do not need to take any action. Self-hosted installations
  should upgrade to version 23.7.2 or higher. There are no direct workarounds, but
  users should review applications authorized on their account and remove any that
  are no longer needed.\n\n"
