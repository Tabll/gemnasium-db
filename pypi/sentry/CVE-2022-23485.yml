package_slug: "pypi/sentry"
title: "Improper Privilege Management"
description: "Sentry is an error tracking and performance monitoring platform. In
  versions of the sentry python library prior to 22.11.0 an attacker with a known
  valid invite link could manipulate a cookie to allow the same invite link to be
  reused on multiple accounts when joining an organization. As a result an attacker
  with a valid invite link can create multiple users and join an organization they
  may not have been originally invited to. This issue was patched in version 22.11.0.
  Sentry SaaS customers do not need to take action. Self-hosted Sentry installs on
  systems which can not upgrade can disable the invite functionality until they are
  ready to deploy the patched version by editing their `sentry.conf.py` file (usually
  located at `~/.sentry/`)."
