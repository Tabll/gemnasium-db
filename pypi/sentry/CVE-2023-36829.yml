package_slug: "pypi/sentry"
title: "Incorrect Comparison"
description: "Sentry is an error tracking and performance monitoring platform. Starting
  in version 23.6.0 and prior to version 23.6.2, the Sentry API incorrectly returns
  the `access-control-allow-credentials: true` HTTP header if the `Origin` request
  header ends with the `system.base-hostname` option of Sentry installation. This
  only affects installations that have `system.base-hostname` option explicitly set,
  as it is empty by default. Impact is limited since recent versions of major browsers
  have cross-site cookie blocking enabled by default. However, this flaw could allow
  other multi-step attacks. The patch has been released in Sentry 23.6.2."
