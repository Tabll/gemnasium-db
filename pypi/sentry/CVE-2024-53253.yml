title: "Sentry improper error handling leaks Application Integration Client Secret"
description: "During routine testing, we identified a scenario where a specific error
  message generated by our platform could include a plaintext Client ID and Client
  Secret for an application integration. The Client ID and Client Secret would not
  be displayed in the UI, but would be returned in the underlying HTTP response to
  the end user. This could occur under the following conditions:\n- An app installation
  made use of a [Search UI component](https://docs.sentry.io/organization/integrations/integration-platform/ui-components/formfield/#select)
  with the `async` flag set to true (default: true),\n- A user types types into the
  Search Component which creates a request to the third-party for search or query
  results, and\n- That third-party response may then fail validation and Sentry would
  return the `select-requester.invalid-response` error code along with a serialized
  version of a Sentry application containing the integration Client Secret.\n\nShould
  this error be found, it's reasonable to assume the potential exposure of an integration
  Client Secret. However, an ID and Secret pair alone does not provide direct access
  to any data. For that secret to be abused an attacker would also need to obtain
  a valid API token for a Sentry application."
