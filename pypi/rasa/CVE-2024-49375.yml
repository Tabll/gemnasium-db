title: "Rasa Allows Remote Code Execution via Remote Model Loading"
description: "## Vulnerability\nA vulnerability has been identified in Rasa Pro and
  Rasa Open Source that enables an attacker who has the ability to load a maliciously
  crafted model remotely into a Rasa instance to achieve Remote Code Execution.\n\nThe
  prerequisites for this are:\n- The HTTP API must be enabled on the Rasa instance
  eg with `--enable-api`. This is not the default configuration.\n- For unauthenticated
  RCE to be exploitable, the user must not have configured any authentication or other
  security controls recommended in our documentation.\n- For authenticated RCE, the
  attacker must posses a valid authentication token or JWT to interact with the Rasa
  API.\n\n## Fix\nWe encourage you to upgrade to a version of Rasa that includes a
  fix. These are:\n\n- Rasa Pro 3.8.18, 3.9.16, 3.10.12\n- Rasa Open Source 3.6.21\n\nOnce
  you have upgraded your Rasa Pro or Open Source installation, you will need to retrain
  your model using the fixed version of Rasa Pro or Open Source. If you have a custom
  component that inherits from one of the components listed below and modified the
  persist or load method, make sure to update your code. Please contact us in case
  you encounter any problems.\n\nAffected components:\n\n- `CountVectorFeaturizer`\n-
  `LexicalSyntacticFeaturizer`\n- `LogisticRegressionClassifier`\n- `SklearnIntentClassifier`\n-
  `DIETClassifier`\n- `CRFEntityExtractor`\n- `TrackerFeaturizer`\n- `TEDPolicy`\n-
  `UnexpectedIntentTEDPolicy`\n\nIf you are unable to upgrade immediately, please
  follow our mitigation advice below.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\n- The unauthenticated
  RCE can be mitigated by ensuring that you enable authentication for the Rasa HTTP
  API if this is enabled. This means that in addition to passing `--enable-api` to
  Rasa, you should also pass an authentication configuration as described in our documentation
  [here](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-pro/production/rest-api/#enabling-the-rest-api).
  \n\n- The authenticated RCE can be mitigated by:\n    - Ensuring that you only load
  models from trusted sources such as your own CI pipelines. You can check file hashes
  for model archives to confirm that a model has not been tampered with between training
  and use.\n    - Confirming that you have sufficient access controls and utilize
  the principle of least privilege to control who in your organization has the ability
  to interact with the Rasa API even with authentication enabled.\n\n## Future Releases\nAs
  an additional security step, a future release of Rasa Pro will remove the ability
  to enable the API without any authentication method enabled.\n\n## Credit\nRasa
