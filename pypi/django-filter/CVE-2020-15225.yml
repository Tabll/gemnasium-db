package_slug: "pypi/django-filter"
title: "Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types"
description: "django-filter is a generic system for filtering Django QuerySets based
  on user selections. In django-filter, automatically generated `NumberFilter` instances,
  whose value was later converted to an integer, were subject to potential DoS from
  maliciously input using exponential format with sufficiently large exponents. +
  applies a `MaxValueValidator` with a a default `limit_value` of 1e50 to the form
  field used by `NumberFilter` instances. In addition, `NumberFilter` implements the
  new `get_max_validator()` which should return a configured validator instance to
  customise the limit, or else `None` to disable the additional validation. Users
  may manually apply an equivalent validator if they are not able to upgrade."
