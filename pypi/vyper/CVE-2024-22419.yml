title: "concat built-in can corrupt memory in vyper"
description: "`concat` built-in can write over the bounds of the memory buffer that
  was allocated for it and thus overwrite existing valid data. The root cause is that
  the `build_IR` for `concat` doesn't properly adhere to the API of copy functions
  (for `>=0.3.2` the `copy_bytes` function).\n\nA contract search was performed and
  no vulnerable contracts were found in production.\n\nTracked in issue https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/issues/3737"
