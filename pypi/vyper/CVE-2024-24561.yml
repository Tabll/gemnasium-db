title: "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer"
description: "Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the ethereum virtual
  machine. In versions 0.3.10 and earlier, the bounds check for slices does not account
  for the ability for start + length to overflow when the values aren't literals.
  If a slice() function uses a non-literal argument for the start or length variable,
  this creates the ability for an attacker to overflow the bounds check. This issue
  can be used to do OOB access to storage, memory or calldata addresses. It can also
  be used to corrupt the length slot of the respective array.\n\n"
