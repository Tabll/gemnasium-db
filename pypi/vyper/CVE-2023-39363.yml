package_slug: "pypi/vyper"
title: "Vyper has incorrectly allocated named re-entrancy locks"
description: "In versions 0.2.15, 0.2.16 and 0.3.0, named re-entrancy locks are allocated
  incorrectly. Each function using a named re-entrancy lock gets a unique lock regardless
  of the key, allowing cross-function re-entrancy in contracts compiled with the susceptible
  versions. A specific set of conditions is required to result in misbehavior of affected
  contracts, specifically:\n\n- A `.vy` contract compiled with either of the following
  `vyper` versions: `0.2.15`, `0.2.16`, `0.3.0`\n- A primary function that utilizes
  the `@nonreentrant` decorator with a specific `key` and does not strictly follow
  the check-effects-interaction pattern (i.e. contains an external call to an untrusted
  party before storage updates)\n- A secondary function that utilizes the same `key`
  and would be affected by the improper state caused by the primary function"
