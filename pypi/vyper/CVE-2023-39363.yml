title: "Incorrect Authorization"
description: "Vyer is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the Ethereum Virtual
  Machine (EVM). In versions 0.2.15, 0.2.16 and 0.3.0, named re-entrancy locks are
  allocated incorrectly. Each function using a named re-entrancy lock gets a unique
  lock regardless of the key, allowing cross-function re-entrancy in contracts compiled
  with the susceptible versions. A specific set of conditions is required to result
  in misbehavior of affected contracts, specifically: a `.vy` contract compiled with
  `vyper` versions `0.2.15`, `0.2.16`, or `0.3.0`; a primary function that utilizes
  the `@nonreentrant` decorator with a specific `key` and does not strictly follow
  the check-effects-interaction pattern (i.e. contains an external call to an untrusted
  party before storage updates); and a secondary function that utilizes the same `key`
  and would be affected by the improper state caused by the primary function. Version
  0.3.1 contains a fix for this issue."
