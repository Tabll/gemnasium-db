title: "Vyper has a double eval in For List Iter"
description: "Multiple evaluation of a single expression is possible in the iterator
  target of a for loop. While the iterator expression cannot produce multiple writes,
  it can consume side effects produced in the loop body (e.g. read a storage variable
  updated in the loop body) and thus lead to unexpected program behavior. Specifically,
  reads in iterators which contain an ifexp (e.g. `for s: uint256 in ([read(), read()]
  if True else [])`) may interleave reads with writes in the loop body.\n\nThe fix
  is tracked in https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/pull/4488."
