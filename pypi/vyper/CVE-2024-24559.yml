package_slug: "pypi/vyper"
title: "Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm"
description: "Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the EVM. There is an
  error in the stack management when compiling the `IR` for `sha3_64`. Concretely,
  the `height` variable is miscalculated. The vulnerability can't be triggered without
  writing the `IR` by hand (that is, it cannot be triggered from regular vyper code).
  `sha3_64` is used for retrieval in mappings. No flow that would cache the `key`
  was found so the issue shouldn't be possible to trigger when compiling the compiler-generated
  `IR`. This issue isn't triggered during normal compilation of vyper code so the
  impact is low. At the time of publication there is no patch available."
