title: "Vyper's `slice()` may elide side-effects when output length is 0"
description: "the `slice()` builtin can elide side effects when the output length
  is 0, and the source bytestring is a builtin (`msg.data` or `<address>.code`). the
  reason is that for these source locations, the check that `length >= 1` is skipped:\nhttps://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/blob/68b68c4b30c5ef2f312b4674676170b8a6eaa316/vyper/builtins/functions.py#L315-L319\n\nthe
  result is that a 0-length bytestring constructed with slice can be passed to `make_byte_array_copier`,
  which elides evaluation of its source argument when the max length is 0:\nhttps://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/blob/68b68c4b30c5ef2f312b4674676170b8a6eaa316/vyper/codegen/core.py#L189-L191\n\nthe
  impact is that side effects in the `start` argument may be elided when the `length`
  argument is 0, e.g. `slice(msg.data, self.do_side_effect(), 0)`.\n\nthe following
  example illustrates how the issue would look in user code\n```vyper\ncounter: public(uint256)\n\n@external\ndef
  test() -> Bytes[10]:\nb: Bytes[10] = slice(msg.data, self.side_effect(), 0)\nreturn
  b\n\ndef side_effect() -> uint256:\nself.counter += 1\nreturn 0\n```\n\nthe severity
  assigned is low, since this is not a very useful pattern and unlikely to be found
  in user code."
