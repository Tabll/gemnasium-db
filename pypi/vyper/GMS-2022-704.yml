title: "Incorrect Comparison"
description: "### Impact\nbytestrings can have dirty bytes in them, resulting in the
  word-for-word comparison to give incorrect results, e.g.\n```vyper\nb1: Bytes[32]
  = b\"abcdef\"\nb1 = slice(b1, 0, 1)\nb2: Bytes[32] = b\"abcdef\"\nt: bool = b1 ==
  b2 # incorrectly evaluates to True\n```\neven without dirty nonzero bytes, because
  there is no comparison of the length, two bytestrings can compare to equal if one
  ends with `\"\\x00\"`.\n```vyper\nb1: Bytes[32] = b\"abc\\0\"\nb2: Bytes[32] = b\"abc\"\nt:
  bool = b1 == b2 # incorrectly evaluates to True\n```\n\n### Patches\nfixed in
