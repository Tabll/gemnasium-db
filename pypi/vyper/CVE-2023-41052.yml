package_slug: "pypi/vyper"
title: "Always-Incorrect Control Flow Implementation"
description: "Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language. In affected versions the
  order of evaluation of the arguments of the builtin functions `uint256_addmod`,
  `uint256_mulmod`, `ecadd` and `ecmul` does not follow source order. This behaviour
  is problematic when the evaluation of one of the arguments produces side effects
  that other arguments depend on. A patch is currently being developed on pull request
  #3583. When using builtins from the list above, users should make sure that the
  arguments of the expression do not produce side effects or, if one does, that no
  other argument is dependent on those side effects."
