title: "Vyper vulnerable to incorrect ordering of arguments for kwargs passed to internal
  calls"
description: "Internal calls to internal functions with more than 1 default argument
  are compiled incorrectly. Depending on the number of arguments\nprovided in the
  call, the defaults are added not right-to-left, but left-to-right. If the types
  are incompatible,\ntypechecking is bypassed. In the `bar()` function in the following
  code, `self.foo(13)` is compiled to\n`self.foo(13,12)` instead of `self.foo(13,1337)`.\n\n```vyper\n@internal\ndef
  foo(a:uint256 = 12, b:uint256 = 1337):\npass\n\n@internal\ndef bar():\nself.foo(13)\n```\n\nnote
  that at the time of publication, the ability to pass kwargs to internal functions
  is an undocumented feature that does not seem to be widely used."
