package_slug: "pypi/vyper"
title: "Function Call With Incorrect Order of Arguments"
description: "Vyper is a Pythonic smart contract language for the Ethereum virtual
  machine. Prior to version 0.3.8, internal calls with default arguments are compiled
  incorrectly. Depending on the number of arguments provided in the call, the defaults
  are added not right-to-left, but left-to-right. If the types are incompatible, typechecking
  is bypassed. The ability to pass kwargs to internal functions is an undocumented
  feature that is not well known about. The issue is patched in version 0.3.8."
