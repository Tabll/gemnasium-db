package_slug: "pypi/vyper"
title: "Integer Overflow or Wraparound"
description: "Vyper is a Pythonic smart contract language for the Ethereum virtual
  machine. Prior to version 0.3.8, due to missing overflow check for loop variables,
  by assigning the iterator of a loop to a variable, it is possible to overflow the
  type of the latter. The issue seems to happen only in loops of type `for i in range(a,
  a + N)` as in loops of type `for i in range(start, stop)` and `for i in range(stop)`,
  the compiler is able to raise a `TypeMismatch` when trying to overflow the variable.
  The problem has been patched in version 0.3.8."
