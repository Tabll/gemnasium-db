package_slug: "pypi/vyper"
title: "Out-of-bounds Write"
description: "Vyper is a Pythonic smart contract language for the Ethereum virtual
  machine. Prior to version 0.3.8, during codegen, the length word of a dynarray is
  written before the data, which can result in out-of-bounds array access in the case
  where the dynarray is on both the lhs and rhs of an assignment. The issue can cause
  data corruption across call frames. The expected behavior is to revert due to out-of-bounds
  array access. Version 0.3.8 contains a patch for this issue."
