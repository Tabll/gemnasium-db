title: "Vyper negative array index bounds checks"
description: "Arrays can be keyed by a signed integer, while they are defined for
  unsigned integers only. The typechecker doesn't throw when spotting the usage of
  an `int` as an index for an array. Typically, negative integers are filtered out
  at runtime by the bounds checker, but small enough (i.e. large in magnitude, ex.
  `-2**255 + 5`) quantities combined with large enough arrays (at least `2**255` in
  length) can pass the bounds checker, resulting in unexpected behavior.\n\nA contract
  search was performed, and no production contracts were found to be impacted."
