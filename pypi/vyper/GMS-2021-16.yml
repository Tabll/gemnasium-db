title: "Storage corruption due to variables overwritten by re-entrancy locks"
description: "### Background\nWhen attempting to use the v0.2.14 release, @pandadefi
  discovered an issue using the `@nonreentrant` decorator.\n\n### Impact\nReentrancy
  protection storage slots get allocated to the same slots as storage variables, leading
  to the corruption of storage variables when using the `@nonreentrant` decorator.\n\n###
  Patches\nThis issue was fixed in v0.2.15 in #2391, #2379\n\n### Workarounds\nDon't
  use the `@nonreentrant` decorator in these versions."
