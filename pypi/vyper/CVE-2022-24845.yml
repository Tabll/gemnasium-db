package_slug: "pypi/vyper"
title: "Integer Overflow or Wraparound"
description: "Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the ethereum virtual
  machine. In affected versions, the return of `<iface>.returns_int128()` is not validated
  to fall within the bounds of `int128`. This issue can result in a misinterpretation
  of the integer value and lead to incorrect behavior. As of v0.3.0, `<iface>.returns_int128()`
  is validated in simple expressions, but not complex expressions. Users are advised
  to upgrade. There is no known workaround for this issue."
