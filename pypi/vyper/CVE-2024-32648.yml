title: "vyper default functions don't respect nonreentrancy keys"
description: "Prior to v0.3.0, `__default__()` functions did not respect the `@nonreentrancy`
  decorator and the lock was not emitted. This is a known bug and was already visible
  in the issue tracker (https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/issues/2455), but it is
  being re-issued as an advisory so that tools relying on the advisory publication
  list can incorporate it into their searches.\n\nA contract search was additionally
  performed and no vulnerable contracts were found in production."
