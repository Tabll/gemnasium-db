title: "vyper performs double eval of the slice args when buffer from adhoc locations"
description: "Using the `slice` builtin can result in a double eval vulnerability
  when the buffer argument is either `msg.data`, `self.code` or `<address>.code` and
  either the `start` or `length` arguments have side-effects.\n\nA contract search
  was performed and no vulnerable contracts were found in production. Having side-effects
  in the start and length patterns is also an unusual pattern which is not that likely
  to show up in user code. It is also much harder (but not impossible!) to trigger
  the bug since `0.3.4` since the unique symbol fence was introduced (https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/pull/2914)."
