package_slug: "pypi/vyper"
title: "Always-Incorrect Control Flow Implementation"
description: "Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the ethereum virtual
  machine. In versions 0.3.1 through 0.3.7, the Vyper compiler generates the wrong
  bytecode. Any contract that uses the `raw_call` with `revert_on_failure=False` and
  `max_outsize=0` receives the wrong response from `raw_call`. Depending on the memory
  garbage, the result can be either `True` or `False`. A patch is available and, as
  of time of publication, anticipated to be part of Vyper 0.3.8. As a workaround,
  one may always put `max_outsize>0`."
