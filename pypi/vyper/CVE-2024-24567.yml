package_slug: "pypi/vyper"
title: "Vyper's raw_call `value=` kwargs not disabled for static and delegate calls"
description: "Vyper compiler allows passing a value in builtin `raw_call` even if
  the call is a `delegatecall` or a `staticcall`. But in the context of `delegatecall`
  and `staticcall` the handling of value is not possible due to the semantics of the
  respective opcodes, and vyper will silently ignore the `value=` argument.\n\nA contract
  search was performed and no vulnerable contracts were found in production."
