package_slug: "pypi/vyper"
title: "Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions"
description: "Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the ethereum virtual
  machine. Vyper compiler allows passing a value in builtin raw_call even if the call
  is a delegatecall or a staticcall. But in the context of delegatecall and staticcall
  the handling of value is not possible due to the semantics of the respective opcodes,
  and vyper will silently ignore the value= argument. If the semantics of the EVM
  are unknown to the developer, he could suspect that by specifying the `value` kwarg,
  exactly the given amount will be sent along to the target. This vulnerability affects
  0.3.10 and earlier versions."
