package_slug: "pypi/vyper"
title: "Vyper's `_abi_decode` vulnerable to Memory Overflow"
description: "If an excessively large value is specified as the starting index for
  an array in `_abi_decode`, it can cause the read position to overflow. This results
  in the decoding of values outside the intended array bounds, potentially leading
  to bugs in contracts that use arrays within `_abi_decode`. The advisory has been
  assigned low severity, because it is only observable if there is a memory write
  between two invocations of `abi_decode` on the same input."
