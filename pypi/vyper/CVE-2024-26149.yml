title: "Vyper's `_abi_decode` vulnerable to Memory Overflow"
description: "## Summary\n\nIf an excessively large value is specified as the starting
  index for an array in `_abi_decode`, it can cause the read position to overflow.
  This results in the decoding of values outside the intended array bounds, potentially
  leading to bugs in contracts that use arrays within `_abi_decode`. The advisory
  has been assigned low severity, because it is only observable if there is a memory
  write between two invocations of `abi_decode` on the same input."
