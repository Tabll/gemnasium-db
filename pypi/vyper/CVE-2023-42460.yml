title: "Vyper's `_abi_decode` input not validated in complex expressions"
description: "### Impact\n`_abi_decode()` does not validate input when it is nested
  in an expression. the following example gets correctly validated (bounds checked):\n```vyper\nx:
  int128 = _abi_decode(slice(msg.data, 4, 32), int128)\n```\n\nhowever, the following
  example is not bounds checked\n```vyper\n@external\ndef abi_decode(x: uint256) ->
  uint256:\n a: uint256 = convert(_abi_decode(slice(msg.data, 4, 32), (uint8)), uint256)
  + 1\n return a # abi_decode(256) returns: 257\n```\n\nthe issue can be triggered
  by constructing an example where the output of `_abi_decode` is not internally passed
  to `make_setter` (an internal codegen routine) or other input validating routine.\n\n###
