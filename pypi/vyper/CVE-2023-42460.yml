title: "Vyper's `_abi_decode` input not validated in complex expressions"
description: "`_abi_decode()` does not validate input when it is nested in an expression.
  the following example gets correctly validated (bounds checked):\n```vyper\nx: int128
  = _abi_decode(slice(msg.data, 4, 32), int128)\n```\n\nhowever, the following example
  is not bounds checked\n```vyper\n@external\ndef abi_decode(x: uint256) -> uint256:\na:
  uint256 = convert(_abi_decode(slice(msg.data, 4, 32), (uint8)), uint256) + 1\nreturn
  a  # abi_decode(256) returns: 257\n```\n\nthe issue can be triggered by constructing
  an example where the output of `_abi_decode` is not internally passed to `make_setter`
  (an internal codegen routine) or other input validating routine."
