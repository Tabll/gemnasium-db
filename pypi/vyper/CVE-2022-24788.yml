title: "Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')"
description: "Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the ethereum virtual
  machine. Versions of vyper prior to 0.3.2 suffer from a potential buffer overrun.
  Importing a function from a JSON interface which returns `bytes` generates bytecode
  which does not clamp bytes length, potentially resulting in a buffer overrun. Users
  are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue."
