title: "Vyper's `extract32` can ready dirty memory"
description: "When using the built-in `extract32(b, start)`, if the `start` index
  provided has for side effect to update `b`, the byte array to extract `32` bytes
  from, it could be that some dirty memory is read and returned by `extract32`.\n\nAs
  of v0.4.0 (specifically, commit https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/commit/3d9c537142fb99b2672f21e2057f5f202cde194f),
  the compiler will panic instead of generating bytecode."
