title: "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer"
description: "A parsing vulnerability for the MessageSet type in the ProtocolBuffers
  versions prior to and including 3.16.1, 3.17.3, 3.18.2, 3.19.4, 3.20.1 and 3.21.5
  for protobuf-cpp, and versions prior to and including 3.16.1, 3.17.3, 3.18.2, 3.19.4,
  3.20.1 and 4.21.5 for protobuf-python can lead to out of memory failures. A specially
  crafted message with multiple key-value per elements creates parsing issues, and
  can lead to a Denial of Service against services receiving unsanitized input. We
  recommend upgrading to versions 3.18.3, 3.19.5, 3.20.2, 3.21.6 for protobuf-cpp
  and 3.18.3, 3.19.5, 3.20.2, 4.21.6 for protobuf-python. Versions for 3.16 and 3.17
  are no longer updated."
