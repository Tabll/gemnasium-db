title: "protobuf affected by a JSON recursion depth bypass"
description: "A denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability exists in google.protobuf.json_format.ParseDict()
  in Python, where the max_recursion_depth limit can be bypassed when parsing nested
  google.protobuf.Any messages.\n\nDue to missing recursion depth accounting inside
  the internal Any-handling logic, an attacker can supply deeply nested Any structures
  that bypass the intended recursion limit, eventually exhausting Python’s recursion
  stack and causing a RecursionError."
