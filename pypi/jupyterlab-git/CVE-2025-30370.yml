title: "jupyterlab-git has a command injection vulnerability in \"Open Git Repository
  in Terminal\""
description: "## Overview\n\nOn many platforms, a third party can create a Git repository
  under a name that includes a shell command substitution [^1] string in the syntax
  `$(<command>)`. These directory names are allowed in macOS and a majority of Linux
  distributions [^2]. If a user starts `jupyter-lab` in a parent directory of this
  inappropriately-named Git repository, opens it, and clicks \"Git > Open Git Repository
  in Terminal\" from the menu bar, then the injected command `<command>` is run in
  the user's shell without the user's permission.\n\nThis issue is occurring because
  when that menu entry is clicked, `jupyterlab-git` opens the terminal and runs `cd
  <git-repo-path>` through the shell to set the current directory [^3]. Doing so runs
  any command substitution strings present in the directory name, which leads to the
  command injection issue described here. A previous patch provided an incomplete
  fix [^4]."
