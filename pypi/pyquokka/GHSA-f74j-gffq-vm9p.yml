title: "pyquokka is Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution by Pickle Deserialization
  via FlightServer "
description: "In the FlightServer class of the pyquokka framework, the do_action() method directly
  uses pickle.loads() to deserialize action bodies received from Flight clients without
  any sanitization or validation, which results in a remote code execution vulnerability.
  The vulnerable code is located in pyquokka/flight.py at line 283, where arbitrary
  data from Flight clients is directly passed to pickle.loads().\n\nEven more concerning,
  when FlightServer is configured to listen on 0.0.0.0 (as shown in the provided server
  example at line 339), this allows attackers across the entire network to perform
  arbitrary remote code execution by sending malicious pickled payloads through the set_configs action.\n\nIn
  addition, the functions cache_garbage_collect, do_put, and do_get also contain vulnerability
  points where pickle.loads is used to deserialize untrusted remote data. Please review
  and fix these issues accordingly. This report uses the set_configs action as an
  example."
