title: "Reverb use after free vulnerability"
description: "There exists a use after free vulnerability in Reverb. Reverb supports
  the VARIANT datatype, which is supposed to represent an arbitrary object in C++.
  When a tensor proto of type VARIANT is unpacked, memory is first allocated to store
  the entire tensor, and a ctor is called on each instance. Afterwards, Reverb copies
  the content in tensor_content to the previously mentioned pre-allocated memory,
  which results in the bytes in tensor_content overwriting the vtable pointers of
  all the objects which were previously allocated. Reverb exposes 2 relevant gRPC
  endpoints: InsertStream and SampleStream. The attacker can insert this stream into
  the server’s database, then when the client next calls SampleStream they will unpack
  the tensor into RAM, and when any method on that object is called (including its
  destructor) the attacker gains control of the Program Counter. We recommend upgrading
  past git commit  https://github.com/google-deepmind/reverb/commit/6a0dcf4c9e842b7f999912f792aaa6f6bd261a25"
