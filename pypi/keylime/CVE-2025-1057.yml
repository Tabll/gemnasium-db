title: "Keylime registrar is vulnerable to Denial-of-Service attack when updated to
  version 7.12.0"
description: "The Keylime `registrar` implemented more strict type checking on version
  7.12.0. As a result, when updated to version 7.12.0, the `registrar` will not accept
  the format of the data previously stored in the database by versions  >= 7.8.0,
  raising an exception.\n\nThis makes the Keylime `registrar` vulnerable to a Denial-of-Service
  attack in an update scenario, as an attacker could populate the `registrar` database
  by creating multiple valid agent registrations with different UUIDs while the version
  is still < 7.12.0. Then, when the Keylime `registrar` is updated to the 7.12.0 version,
  any query to the database matching any of the entries populated by the attacker
  will result in failure."
