title: "Keylime registrar and (untrusted) Agent can be bypassed by an attacker"
description: "A security issue was found in the Keylime `registrar` code which allows
  an attacker to effectively bypass the challenge-response protocol used to verify
  that an `agent` has indeed access to an AIK which in indeed related to the EK.\n\nWhen
  an `agent` starts up, it will contact a `registrar` and provide a public EK and
  public AIK, in addition to the EK Certificate. This `registrar` will then challenge
  the `agent` to decrypt a challenge encrypted with the EK.\n\nWhen receiving the
  wrong \"auth_tag\" back from the `agent` during activation, the `registrar` answers
  with an error message that contains the expected correct \"auth_tag\" (an HMAC which
  is calculated within the `registrar` for checking). An attacker could simply record
  the correct expected \"auth_tag\" from the HTTP error message and perform the activate
  call again with the correct expected \"auth_tag\" for the `agent`.\n\nThe security
  issue allows an attacker to pass the challenge-response protocol during registration
  with (almost) arbitrary registration data. In particular, the attacker can provide
  a valid EK Certificate and EK, which passes verification by the `tenant` (or `registrar`),
  while using a compromised AIK, which is stored unprotected outside the TPM and is
  unrelated to former two. The attacker then deliberately fails the initial activation
  call to get to know the correct \"auth_tag\" and then provides it in a subsequent
  activation call. This results in an `agent` which is (incorrectly) registered with
  a valid EK Certificate, but with a compromised/unrelated AIK."
