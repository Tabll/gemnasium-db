package_slug: "pypi/keylime"
title: "Keylime: unhandled exceptions could lead to invalid attestation states"
description: "### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability creates a false sense of security for
  keylime users -- i.e. a user could query keylime and conclude that a parcitular
  node/agent is correctly attested, while attestations are not in fact taking place.\n\n**Short
  explanation**: the keylime verifier creates periodic reports on the state of each
  attested agent. The keylime verifier runs a set of python asynchronous processes
  to challenge attested nodes and create reports on the outcome. \n\nThe vulnerability
  consists of the above named python asynchronous processes failing silently, i.e.
  quitting without leaving behind a database entry, raising an error or producing
  even a mention of an error in a log. The silent failure can be triggered by a small
  set of transient network failure conditions; recoverable device driver crashes being
  one such condition we saw in the wild.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem is fixed in
  keylime starting with tag 6.5.1\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThis [patch](https://github.com/keylime/keylime/pull/1128/files)
  can be retroactively applied to any running keylime deployment.\nOnly running verifiers
  need to be patched.\nAfter the patch is applied, the keylime verifier needs to be
  restarted.\n\n### References\n\nThe problem, as well as the proposed fix, are described
  in detail [here](https://github.com/keylime/keylime/pull/1128).\nFurther details
  about the system where the bug was found, and the conditions in which the bug was
  found, are available from @galmasi on demand.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf
