title: "Keylime Missing Authentication for Critical Function and Improper Authentication"
description: "The Keylime registrar does not enforce mutual TLS (mTLS) client certificate
  authentication since version 7.12.0. The registrar's TLS context is configured with
  `ssl.CERT_OPTIONAL` instead of `ssl.CERT_REQUIRED`, allowing any client to connect
  to protected API endpoints without presenting a valid client certificate.\n\n**Who
  is impacted:**\n- All Keylime deployments running versions 7.12.0 through 7.13.0\n-
  Environments where the registrar HTTPS port (default 8891) is network-accessible
  to untrusted clients\n\n**What an attacker can do:**\n- **List all registered agents**
  (`GET /v2/agents/`) - enumerate the entire agent inventory\n- **Retrieve agent details**
  (`GET /v2/agents/{uuid}`) - obtain public TPM keys, certificates, and network locations
  (IP/port) of any agent\n- **Delete any agent** (`DELETE /v2/agents/{uuid}`) - remove
  agents from the registry, disrupting attestation services\n\nNote: The exposed TPM
  data (EK, AK, certificates) consists of public keys and certificates. Private keys
  remain protected within TPM hardware. The HMAC secret used for challenge-response
  validation is stored in the database but is not exposed via the API.\n\n**Affected
  versions:** >= 7.12.0, <= 7.13.0\n\n**Fixed versions:** 7.12.2, >= 7.13.1"
