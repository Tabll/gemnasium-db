title: "Duplicate Advisory: Keylime Missing Authentication for Critical Function and
  Improper Authentication"
description: "### Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it
  is a duplicate of GHSA-4jqp-9qjv-57m2. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n### Original Description\nA flaw was found in Keylime. The Keylime
  registrar, since version 7.12.0, does not enforce client-side Transport Layer Security
  (TLS) authentication. This authentication bypass vulnerability allows unauthenticated
  clients with network access to perform administrative operations, including listing
  agents, retrieving public Trusted Platform Module (TPM) data, and deleting agents,
  by connecting without presenting a client certificate."
