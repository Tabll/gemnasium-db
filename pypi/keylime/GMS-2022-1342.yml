package_slug: "pypi/keylime"
title: "Tenant and Verifier might not use the same registrar data"
description: "Keylime does not enforce that the agent registrar data is the same when
  the tenant uses it for validation of the EK and identity quote and the verifier
  for validating the integrity quote. This allows an attacker to use one AK, EK pair
  from a real TPM to pass EK validation and give the verifier an AK of a software
  TPM. A successful attack breaks the entire chain of trust because a not validated
  AK is used by the verifier. This issue is worse if the validation happens first
  and then the agent gets added to the verifier because the timing is easier and the
  verifier does not validate the regcount entry being equal to 1. At this time, there
  are no known workaround."
