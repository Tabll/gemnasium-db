title: "Hugging Face Transformers Regular Expression Denial of Service"
description: "A vulnerability in the `preprocess_string()` function of the `transformers.testing_utils`
  module in huggingface/transformers version v4.48.3 allows for a Regular Expression
  Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack. The regular expression used to process code blocks
  in docstrings contains nested quantifiers, leading to exponential backtracking when
  processing input with a large number of newline characters. An attacker can exploit
  this by providing a specially crafted payload, causing high CPU usage and potential
  application downtime, effectively resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) scenario."
