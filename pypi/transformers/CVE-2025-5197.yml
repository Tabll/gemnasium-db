title: "Hugging Face Transformers Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability"
description: "A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists
  in the Hugging Face Transformers library, specifically in the `convert_tf_weight_name_to_pt_weight_name()`
  function. This function, responsible for converting TensorFlow weight names to PyTorch
  format, uses a regex pattern `/[^/]*___([^/]*)/` that can be exploited to cause
  excessive CPU consumption through crafted input strings due to catastrophic backtracking.
  The vulnerability affects versions up to 4.51.3 and is fixed in version 4.53.0.
  This issue can lead to service disruption, resource exhaustion, and potential API
  service vulnerabilities, impacting model conversion processes between TensorFlow
  and PyTorch formats."
