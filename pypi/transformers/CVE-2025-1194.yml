title: "Transformers Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability"
description: "A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability was identified
  in the huggingface/transformers library, specifically in the file `tokenization_gpt_neox_japanese.py`
  of the GPT-NeoX-Japanese model. The vulnerability occurs in the SubWordJapaneseTokenizer
  class, where regular expressions process specially crafted inputs. The issue stems
  from a regex exhibiting exponential complexity under certain conditions, leading
  to excessive backtracking. This can result in high CPU usage and potential application
  downtime, effectively creating a Denial of Service (DoS) scenario. The affected
  version is v4.48.1 (latest)."
