title: "Transformers's Improper Input Validation vulnerability can be exploited through
  username injection"
description: "Hugging Face Transformers versions up to 4.49.0 are affected by an improper
  input validation vulnerability in the `image_utils.py` file. The vulnerability arises
  from insecure URL validation using the `startswith()` method, which can be bypassed
  through URL username injection. This allows attackers to craft URLs that appear
  to be from YouTube but resolve to malicious domains, potentially leading to phishing
  attacks, malware distribution, or data exfiltration. The issue is fixed in version
  4.52.1."
