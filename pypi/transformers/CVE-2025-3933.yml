title: "Transformers is vulnerable to ReDoS attack through its DonutProcessor class"
description: "A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability was discovered
  in the Hugging Face Transformers library, specifically within the DonutProcessor
  class's `token2json()` method. This vulnerability affects versions 4.51.3 and earlier,
  and is fixed in version 4.52.1. The issue arises from the regex pattern `<s_(.*?)>`
  which can be exploited to cause excessive CPU consumption through crafted input
  strings due to catastrophic backtracking. This vulnerability can lead to service
  disruption, resource exhaustion, and potential API service vulnerabilities, impacting
  document processing tasks using the Donut model."
