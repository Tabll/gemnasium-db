title: "Transformers vulnerable to ReDoS attack through its get_imports() function"
description: "A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability was discovered
  in the Hugging Face Transformers library, specifically in the `get_imports()` function
  within `dynamic_module_utils.py`. This vulnerability affects versions 4.49.0 and
  is fixed in version 4.51.0. The issue arises from a regular expression pattern `\\s*try\\s*:.*?except.*?:`
  used to filter out try/except blocks from Python code, which can be exploited to
  cause excessive CPU consumption through crafted input strings due to catastrophic
  backtracking. This vulnerability can lead to remote code loading disruption, resource
  exhaustion in model serving, supply chain attack vectors, and development pipeline
  disruption."
