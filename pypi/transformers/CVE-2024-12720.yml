title: "Transformers Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability"
description: "A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability was identified
  in the huggingface/transformers library, specifically in the file tokenization_nougat_fast.py.
  The vulnerability occurs in the post_process_single() function, where a regular
  expression processes specially crafted input. The issue stems from the regex exhibiting
  exponential time complexity under certain conditions, leading to excessive backtracking.
  This can result in significantly high CPU usage and potential application downtime,
  effectively creating a Denial of Service (DoS) scenario. The affected version is
  v4.46.3."
