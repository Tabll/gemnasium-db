title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data in Hugging Face Transformers"
description: "Hugging Face Transformers MobileViTV2 Deserialization of Untrusted Data
  Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers
  to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Hugging Face Transformers.
  User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must
  visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within
  the handling of configuration files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation
  of user-supplied data, which can result in deserialization of untrusted data. An
  attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current
  user. Was ZDI-CAN-24322."
