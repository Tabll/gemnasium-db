title: "Hugging Face Transformers vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service
  (ReDoS) in the AdamWeightDecay optimizer"
description: "The huggingface/transformers library, versions prior to 4.53.0, is vulnerable
  to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in the AdamWeightDecay optimizer.
  The vulnerability arises from the _do_use_weight_decay method, which processes user-controlled
  regular expressions in the include_in_weight_decay and exclude_from_weight_decay
  lists. Malicious regular expressions can cause catastrophic backtracking during
  the re.search call, leading to 100% CPU utilization and a denial of service. This
  issue can be exploited by attackers who can control the patterns in these lists,
  potentially causing the machine learning task to hang and rendering services unresponsive."
