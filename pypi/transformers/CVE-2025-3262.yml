title: "Transformers vulnerable to ReDoS attack through its SETTING_RE variable"
description: "A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability was discovered
  in the huggingface/transformers repository, specifically in version 4.49.0. The
  vulnerability is due to inefficient regular expression complexity in the `SETTING_RE`
  variable within the `transformers/commands/chat.py` file. The regex contains repetition
  groups and non-optimized quantifiers, leading to exponential backtracking when processing
  'almost matching' payloads. This can degrade application performance and potentially
  result in a denial-of-service (DoS) when handling specially crafted input strings.
  The issue is fixed in version 4.51.0."
