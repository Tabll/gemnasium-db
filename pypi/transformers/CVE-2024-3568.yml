title: "Transformers Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability"
description: "The huggingface/transformers library is vulnerable to arbitrary code
  execution through deserialization of untrusted data within the `load_repo_checkpoint()`
  function of the `TFPreTrainedModel()` class. Attackers can execute arbitrary code
  and commands by crafting a malicious serialized payload, exploiting the use of `pickle.load()`
  on data from potentially untrusted sources. This vulnerability allows for remote
  code execution (RCE) by deceiving victims into loading a seemingly harmless checkpoint
  during a normal training process, thereby enabling attackers to execute arbitrary
  code on the targeted machine."
