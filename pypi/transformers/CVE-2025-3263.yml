title: "Transformers's ReDoS vulnerability in get_configuration_file can lead to catastrophic
  backtracking"
description: "A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability was discovered
  in the Hugging Face Transformers library, specifically in the `get_configuration_file()`
  function within the `transformers.configuration_utils` module. The affected version
  is 4.49.0, and the issue is resolved in version 4.51.0. The vulnerability arises
  from the use of a regular expression pattern `config\\.(.*)\\.json` that can be
  exploited to cause excessive CPU consumption through crafted input strings, leading
  to catastrophic backtracking. This can result in model serving disruption, resource
  exhaustion, and increased latency in applications using the library."
