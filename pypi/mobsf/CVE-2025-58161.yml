title: "MobSF Path Traversal in GET /download/<filename> using absolute filenames"
description: "The GET /download/<filename> route uses string path verification via
  os.path.commonprefix, which allows an authenticated user to download files outside
  the DWD_DIR download directory from \"neighboring\" directories whose absolute paths
  begin with the same prefix as DWD_DIR (e.g., .../downloads_bak, .../downloads.old).
  This is a Directory Traversal (escape) leading to a data leak."
