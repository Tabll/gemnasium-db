title: "Mobile Security Framework (MobSF) has a Zip Slip Vulnerability in .a Static
  Library Files"
description: "Upon reviewing the MobSF source code, I identified a flaw in the Static
  Libraries analysis section. Specifically, during the extraction of .a extension
  files, the measure intended to prevent Zip Slip attacks is improperly implemented.\n\nSince
  the implemented measure can be bypassed, the vulnerability allows an attacker to
  extract files to any desired location within the server running MobSF."
