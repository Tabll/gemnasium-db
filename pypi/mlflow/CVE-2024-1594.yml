title: "mlflow vulnerable to Path Traversal"
description: "A path traversal vulnerability exists in the mlflow/mlflow repository,
  specifically within the handling of the `artifact_location` parameter when creating
  an experiment. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by using a fragment component
  `#` in the artifact location URI to read arbitrary files on the server in the context
  of the server's process. This issue is similar to CVE-2023-6909 but utilizes a different
  component of the URI to achieve the same effect."
