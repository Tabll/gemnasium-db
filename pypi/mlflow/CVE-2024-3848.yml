title: "MLflow has a Local File Read/Path Traversal bypass"
description: "A path traversal vulnerability exists in mlflow/mlflow version 2.11.0,
  identified as a bypass for the previously addressed CVE-2023-6909. The vulnerability
  arises from the application's handling of artifact URLs, where a '#' character can
  be used to insert a path into the fragment, effectively skipping validation. This
  allows an attacker to construct a URL that, when processed, ignores the protocol
  scheme and uses the provided path for filesystem access. As a result, an attacker
  can read arbitrary files, including sensitive information such as SSH and cloud
  keys, by exploiting the way the application converts the URL into a filesystem path.
  The issue stems from insufficient validation of the fragment portion of the URL,
  leading to arbitrary file read through path traversal."
