package_slug: "pypi/mlflow"
title: "mlflow is vulnerable to remote file access in `mlflow server` and `mlflow
  ui` CLIs"
description: "Users of the MLflow Open Source Project who are hosting the MLflow Model
  Registry using the `mlflow server` or `mlflow ui` commands using an MLflow version
  older than MLflow 2.2.1 may be vulnerable to a remote file access exploit if they
  are not limiting who can query their server (for example, by using a cloud VPC,
  an IP allowlist for inbound requests, or authentication / authorization middleware).\n\nThis
  issue only affects users and integrations that run the `mlflow server` and `mlflow
  ui` commands. Integrations that do not make use of `mlflow server` or `mlflow ui`
  are unaffected; for example, the Databricks Managed MLflow product and MLflow on
  Azure Machine Learning do not make use of these commands and are not impacted by
  these vulnerabilities in any way.\n\nThe vulnerability detailed in https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-1177
  enables an actor to download arbitrary files unrelated to MLflow from the host server,
  including any files stored in remote locations to which the host server has access."
