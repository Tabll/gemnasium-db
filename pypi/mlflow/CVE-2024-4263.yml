package_slug: "pypi/mlflow"
title: "MLflow allows low privilege users to delete any artifact"
description: "A broken access control vulnerability exists in mlflow/mlflow versions
  before 2.10.1, where low privilege users with only EDIT permissions on an experiment
  can delete any artifacts. This issue arises due to the lack of proper validation
  for DELETE requests by users with EDIT permissions, allowing them to perform unauthorized
  deletions of artifacts. The vulnerability specifically affects the handling of artifact
  deletions within the application, as demonstrated by the ability of a low privilege
  user to delete a directory inside an artifact using a DELETE request, despite the
  official documentation stating that users with EDIT permission can only read and
  update artifacts, not delete them."
