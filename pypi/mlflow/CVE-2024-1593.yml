package_slug: "pypi/mlflow"
title: "mlflow vulnerable to Path Traversal"
description: "A path traversal vulnerability exists in the mlflow/mlflow repository
  due to improper handling of URL parameters. By smuggling path traversal sequences
  using the ';' character in URLs, attackers can manipulate the 'params' portion of
  the URL to gain unauthorized access to files or directories. This vulnerability
  allows for arbitrary data smuggling into the 'params' part of the URL, enabling
  attacks similar to those described in previous reports but utilizing the ';' character
  for parameter smuggling. Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized information
  disclosure or server compromise."
