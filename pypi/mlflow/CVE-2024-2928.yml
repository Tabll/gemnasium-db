title: "Local File Inclusion in mlflow"
description: "A Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability was identified in mlflow/mlflow,
  specifically in version 2.9.2, which was fixed in version 2.11.3. This vulnerability
  arises from the application's failure to properly validate URI fragments for directory
  traversal sequences such as '../'. An attacker can exploit this flaw by manipulating
  the fragment part of the URI to read arbitrary files on the local file system, including
  sensitive files like '/etc/passwd'. The vulnerability is a bypass to a previous
  patch that only addressed similar manipulation within the URI's query string, highlighting
  the need for comprehensive validation of all parts of a URI to prevent LFI attacks."
