package_slug: "pypi/mlflow"
title: "MLflow has a Local File Read/Path Traversal in dbfs"
description: "A path traversal vulnerability exists in mlflow/mlflow version 2.15.1.
  When users configure and use the dbfs service, concatenating the URL directly into
  the file protocol results in an arbitrary file read vulnerability. This issue occurs
  because only the path part of the URL is checked, while parts such as query and
  parameters are not handled. The vulnerability is triggered if the user has configured
  the dbfs service, and during usage, the service is mounted to a local directory."
