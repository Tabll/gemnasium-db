title: "mlflow Path Traversal vulnerability"
description: "A path traversal vulnerability exists in mlflow/mlflow version 2.9.2,
  allowing attackers to access arbitrary files on the server. By crafting a series
  of HTTP POST requests with specially crafted 'artifact_location' and 'source' parameters,
  using a local URI with '#' instead of '?', an attacker can traverse the server's
  directory structure. The issue occurs due to insufficient validation of user-supplied
  input in the server's handlers."
