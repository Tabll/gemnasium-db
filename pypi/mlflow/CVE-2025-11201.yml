title: "MLflow Tracking Server Model Creation Directory Traversal Remote Code Execution
  Vulnerability"
description: "MLflow Tracking Server Model Creation Directory Traversal Remote Code
  Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
  code on affected installations of MLflow Tracking Server. Authentication is not
  required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling
  of model file paths. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied
