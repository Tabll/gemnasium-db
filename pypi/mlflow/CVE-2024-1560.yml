title: "mlflow vulnerable to Path Traversal"
description: "A path traversal vulnerability exists in the mlflow/mlflow repository,
  specifically within the artifact deletion functionality. Attackers can bypass path
  validation by exploiting the double decoding process in the `_delete_artifact_mlflow_artifacts`
  handler and `local_file_uri_to_path` function, allowing for the deletion of arbitrary
  directories on the server's filesystem. This vulnerability is due to an extra unquote
  operation in the `delete_artifacts` function of `local_artifact_repo.py`, which
  fails to properly sanitize user-supplied paths. The issue is present up to version
  2.9.2, despite attempts to fix a similar issue in CVE-2023-6831."
