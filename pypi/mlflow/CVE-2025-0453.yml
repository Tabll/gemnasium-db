title: "MLflow Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability"
description: "In mlflow/mlflow version 2.17.2, the `/graphql` endpoint is vulnerable
  to a denial of service attack. An attacker can create large batches of queries that
  repeatedly request all runs from a given experiment. This can tie up all the workers
  allocated by MLFlow, rendering the application unable to respond to other requests.
  This vulnerability is due to uncontrolled resource consumption."
