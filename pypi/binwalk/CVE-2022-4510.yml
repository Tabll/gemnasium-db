package_slug: "pypi/binwalk"
title: "Path traversal in binwalk"
description: "A path traversal vulnerability was identified in ReFirm Labs binwalk
  from version 2.1.2b through 2.3.3 inclusive. By crafting a malicious PFS filesystem
  file, an attacker can get binwalk's PFS extractor to extract files at arbitrary
  locations when binwalk is run in extraction mode (-e option). Remote code execution
  can be achieved by building a PFS filesystem that, upon extraction, would extract
  a malicious binwalk module into the folder .config/binwalk/plugins. This vulnerability
  is associated with program files src/binwalk/plugins/unpfs.py. This issue affects
  binwalk from 2.1.2b through and including 2.3.3."
