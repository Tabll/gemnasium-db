title: "Duplicate Advisory: Qiskit allows arbitrary code execution decoding QPY format
  versions < 13"
description: "# Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-6m2c-76ff-6vrf. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n# Original Description\nA maliciously crafted QPY file can potential
  execute arbitrary-code embedded in the payload without privilege escalation when
  deserialising QPY formats < 13. A python process calling Qiskit 0.18.0 through 1.4.1's
  `qiskit.qpy.load()` function could potentially execute any arbitrary Python code
  embedded in the correct place in the binary file as part of specially constructed
  payload."
