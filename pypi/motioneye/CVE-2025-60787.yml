package_slug: "pypi/motioneye"
title: "motionEye vulnerable to RCE via unsanitized motion config parameter"
description: "A command injection vulnerability in MotionEye allows attackers to achieve
  Remote Code Execution (RCE) by supplying malicious values in configuration fields
  exposed via the Web UI. Because MotionEye writes user-supplied values directly into
  Motion configuration files without sanitization, attackers can inject shell syntax
  that is executed when the Motion process restarts. This issue enables full takeover
  of the MotionEye container and potentially the host environment (depending on container
  privileges)."
