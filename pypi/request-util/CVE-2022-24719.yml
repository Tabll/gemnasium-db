title: "Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer"
description: "Fluture-Node is a FP-style HTTP and streaming utils for Node based on
  Fluture. Using `followRedirects` or `followRedirectsWith` with any of the redirection
  strategies built into fluture-node 4.0.0 or 4.0.1, paired with a request that includes
  confidential headers such as Authorization or Cookie, exposes you to a vulnerability
  where, if the destination server were to redirect the request to a server on a third-party
  domain, or the same domain over unencrypted HTTP, the headers would be included
  in the follow-up request and be exposed to the third party, or potential http traffic
  sniffing. The redirection strategies made available in version 4.0.2 automatically
  redact confidential headers when a redirect is followed across to another origin.
  A workaround has been identified by using a custom redirection strategy via the
  `followRedirectsWith` function. The custom strategy can be based on the new strategies
  available in fluture-node@4.0.2."
