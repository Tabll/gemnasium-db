title: "dbt-core's secret env vars written to package-lock.json in plaintext"
description: "### Impact\n\nWhen used to pull source code from a private repository
  using a Personal Access Token (PAT), some versions of dbt-core write a URL with
  the PAT in plaintext to the `package-lock.yml` file.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe bug has
  been fixed in [dbt-core v1.7.3](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/releases/tag/v1.7.3).\n\n###
  Mitigations\n\nRemove any git URLs with plaintext secrets from `package-lock.yml`
  file(s) on servers, workstations, or in source control. Rotate any tokens that have
  been written to version-controlled files."
