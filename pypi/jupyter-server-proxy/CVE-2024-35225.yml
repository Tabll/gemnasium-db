title: "Jupyter Server Proxy has a reflected XSS issue in host parameter"
description: "There is a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in `jupyter-server-proxy`[1].
  The `/proxy` endpoint accepts a `host` path segment in the format `/proxy/<host>`.
  When this endpoint is called with an invalid `host` value, `jupyter-server-proxy`
  replies with a response that includes the value of `host`, without sanitization
  [2]. A third-party actor can leverage this by sending a phishing link with an invalid
  `host` value containing custom JavaScript to a user. When the user clicks this phishing
  link, the browser renders the response of `GET /proxy/<host>`, which runs the custom
  JavaScript contained in `host` set by the actor.\nAs any arbitrary JavaScript can
  be run after the user clicks on a phishing link, this issue permits extensive access
  to the user's JupyterLab instance for an actor. This issue exists in the latest
  release of `jupyter-server-proxy`, currently `v4.1.2`.\n**Impacted versions:** `>=3.0.0,<=4.1.2`"
