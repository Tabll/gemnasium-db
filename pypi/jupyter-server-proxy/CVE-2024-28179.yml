package_slug: "pypi/jupyter-server-proxy"
title: "Jupyter Server Proxy's Websocket Proxying does not require authentication"
description: "`jupyter-server-proxy` is used to expose ports local to a Jupyter server
  listening to web traffic to the Jupyter server's _authenticated users_ by proxying
  web requests and websockets. Dependent packages ([partial list](https://www.wheelodex.org/projects/jupyter-server-proxy/rdepends/))
  also use `jupyter-server-proxy` to expose other popular interactive applications
  (such as [RStudio](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyter-rsession-proxy), [Linux
  Desktop via VNC](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyter-remote-desktop-proxy), [Code
  Server](https://github.com/betatim/vscode-binder), [Panel](https://github.com/holoviz/jupyter-panel-proxy),
  etc) along with the Jupyter server. This feature is commonly used in hosted environments
  (such as a JupyterHub) to expose non-Jupyter interactive frontends or APIs to the
  user.\n\n`jupyter-server-proxy` did not check user authentication appropriately
  when proxying websockets, allowing unauthenticated access to anyone who had network
  access to the Jupyter server endpoint."
