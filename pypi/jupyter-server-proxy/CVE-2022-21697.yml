package_slug: "pypi/jupyter-server-proxy"
title: "SSRF vulnerability in jupyter-server-proxy"
description: "Jupyter Server Proxy is a Jupyter notebook server extension to proxy
  web services. Versions of Jupyter Server Proxy is vulnerable to Server-Side Request
  Forgery (SSRF). Any user deploying Jupyter Server or Notebook with jupyter-proxy-server
  extension enabled is affected. A lack of input validation allows authenticated clients
  to proxy requests to other hosts, bypassing the `allowed_hosts` check. Because authentication
  is required, which already grants permissions to make the same requests via kernel
  or terminal execution, this is considered low to moderate severity. Users may upgrade
  to to receive a patch or, as a workaround, install the patch manually."
