package_slug: "pypi/jupyter-server-proxy"
title: "SSRF vulnerability in jupyter-server-proxy"
description: "**What kind of vulnerability is it?**  Server-Side Request Forgery (
  SSRF )\n\n**Who is impacted?** Any user deploying Jupyter Server or Notebook with
  jupyter-proxy-server extension enabled.\n\nA lack of input validation allowed authenticated
  clients to proxy requests to other hosts, bypassing the `allowed_hosts` check. Because
  authentication is required, which already grants permissions to make the same requests
  via kernel or terminal execution, this is considered low to moderate severity."
