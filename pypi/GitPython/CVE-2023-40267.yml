package_slug: "pypi/GitPython"
title: "GitPython vulnerable to remote code execution due to insufficient sanitization
  of input arguments"
description: "GitPython before 3.1.32 does not block insecure non-multi options in
  `clone` and `clone_from`, making it vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) due
  to improper user input validation, which makes it possible to inject a maliciously
  crafted remote URL into the clone command. Exploiting this vulnerability is possible
  because the library makes external calls to git without sufficient sanitization
  of input arguments. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2022-24439."
