package_slug: "pypi/GitPython"
title: "GitPython untrusted search path on Windows systems leading to arbitrary code
  execution"
description: "When resolving a program, Python/Windows look for the current working
  directory, and after that the PATH environment (see big warning in https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#popen-constructor).
  GitPython defaults to use the `git` command, if a user runs GitPython from a repo
  has a `git.exe` or `git` executable, that program will be run instead of the one
  in the user's `PATH`."
