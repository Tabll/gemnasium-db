package_slug: "pypi/GitPython"
title: "Untrusted Search Path"
description: "GitPython is a python library used to interact with Git repositories.
  There is an incomplete fix for CVE-2023-40590. On Windows, GitPython uses an untrusted
  search path if it uses a shell to run `git`, as well as when it runs `bash.exe`
  to interpret hooks. If either of those features are used on Windows, a malicious
  `git.exe` or `bash.exe` may be run from an untrusted repository. This issue has
  been patched in version 3.1.41."
