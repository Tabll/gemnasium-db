package_slug: "pypi/GitPython"
title: "Untrusted search path under some conditions on Windows allows arbitrary code
  execution"
description: "This issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2023-40590. On
  Windows, GitPython uses an untrusted search path if it uses a shell to run `git`,
  as well as when it runs `bash.exe` to interpret hooks. If either of those features
  are used on Windows, a malicious `git.exe` or `bash.exe` may be run from an untrusted
  repository."
