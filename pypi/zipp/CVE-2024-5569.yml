package_slug: "pypi/zipp"
title: "zipp Denial of Service vulnerability"
description: "A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the jaraco/zipp library,
  affecting all versions prior to 3.19.1. The vulnerability is triggered when processing
  a specially crafted zip file that leads to an infinite loop. This issue also impacts
  the zipfile module of CPython, as features from the third-party zipp library are
  later merged into CPython, and the affected code is identical in both projects.
  The infinite loop can be initiated through the use of functions affecting the `Path`
  module in both zipp and zipfile, such as `joinpath`, the overloaded division operator,
  and `iterdir`. Although the infinite loop is not resource exhaustive, it prevents
  the application from responding. The vulnerability was addressed in version 3.19.1
  of jaraco/zipp."
