title: "Duplicate Advisory: Path Traversal in Zope"
description: "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-5pr9-v234-jw36. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n## Original Description\nZope is an open-source web application server.
  In Zope versions prior to 4.6 and 5.2, users can access untrusted modules indirectly
  through Python modules that are available for direct use. By default, only users
  with the Manager role can add or edit Zope Page Templates through the web, but sites
  that allow untrusted users to add/edit Zope Page Templates through the web are at
  risk from this vulnerability. The problem has been fixed in Zope 5.2 and 4.6. As
  a workaround, a site administrator can restrict adding/editing Zope Page Templates
  through the web using the standard Zope user/role permission mechanisms. Untrusted
  users should not be assigned the Zope Manager role and adding/editing Zope Page
  Templates through the web should be restricted to trusted users only."
