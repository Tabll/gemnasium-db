package_slug: "pypi/zope"
title: "Remote Code Execution via traversal in TAL expressions"
description: "Most Python modules are not available for using in TAL expressions that
  you can add through-the-web, for example in Zope Page Templates. This restriction
  avoids file system access, for example via the 'os' module. But some of the untrusted
  modules are available indirectly through Python modules that are available for direct
  use.\n\nBy default, you need to have the Manager role to add or edit Zope Page Templates
  through the web. Only sites that allow untrusted users to add/edit Zope Page Templates
  through the web are at risk."
