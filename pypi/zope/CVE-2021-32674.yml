description: "Zope is an open-source web application server. This advisory extends
  the previous advisory at https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/security/advisories/GHSA-5pr9-v234-jw36.
  Most Python modules are not available for using in TAL expressions that you can
  add through-the-web, for example in `Zope Page Templates`. This restriction avoids
  file system access, for example via the `os` module. But some of the untrusted modules
  are available indirectly through Python modules that are available for direct use.
  By default, you need to have the `Manager` role to add or edit `Zope Page Templates`
  through the web. Only sites that allow untrusted users to add/edit `Zope Page Templates`
  through the web are at risk."
