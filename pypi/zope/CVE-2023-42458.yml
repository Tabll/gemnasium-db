title: "Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)"
description: "Zope is an open-source web application server. Prior to versions 4.8.10
  and 5.8.5, there is a stored cross site scripting vulnerability for SVG images.
  Note that an image tag with an SVG image as source is never vulnerable, even when
  the SVG image contains malicious code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker
  would first need to upload an image, and then trick a user into following a specially
  crafted link. Patches are available in Zope 4.8.10 and 5.8.5. As a workaround, make
  sure the \"Add Documents, Images, and Files\" permission is only assigned to trusted
  roles. By default, only the Manager has this permission."
