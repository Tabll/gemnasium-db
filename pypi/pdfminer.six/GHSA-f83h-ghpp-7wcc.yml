title: "Insecure Deserialization (pickle) in pdfminer.six CMap Loader — Local Privesc"
description: "### 🚀 Overview\n\nThis report **demonstrates a real-world privilege
  escalation** vulnerability in [pdfminer.six](https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six)
  due to unsafe usage of Python's `pickle` module for CMap file loading.\nIt shows
  how a low-privileged user can gain root access (or escalate to any service account)
