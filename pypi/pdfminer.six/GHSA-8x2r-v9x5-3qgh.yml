title: "Duplicate Advisory: Insecure Deserialization (pickle) in pdfminer.six CMap
  Loader — Local Privesc"
description: "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-f83h-ghpp-7wcc. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n## Original Description\npdfminer.six before 20251230 contains an
  insecure deserialization vulnerability in the CMap loading mechanism. The library
  uses Python pickle to deserialize CMap cache files without validation. An attacker
  with the ability to place a malicious pickle file in a location accessible to the
  application can trigger arbitrary code execution or privilege escalation when the
  file is loaded by a trusted process. This is caused by an incomplete patch to CVE-2025-64512."
