title: "Apache HDFS Provider error message suggested"
description: "In the Apache Airflow HDFS Provider, versions prior to 4.1.1, a documentationÂ info
  pointed users to an install incorrect pip package. As this package name was unclaimed,
  in theory, an attacker could claim this package and provide code that would be executed
  when this package was installed. The Airflow team has since taken ownership of the
  package (neutralizing the risk), and fixed the doc strings in version 4.1.1"
