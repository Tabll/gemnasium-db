title: "PyTorch deserialization vulnerability"
description: "A deserialization vulnerability exists in the Pytorch RPC framework
  (torch.distributed.rpc) in pytorch/pytorch versions <=2.3.1. The vulnerability arises
  from the lack of security verification during the deserialization process of PythonUDF
  objects in pytorch/torch/distributed/rpc/internal.py. This flaw allows an attacker
  to execute arbitrary code remotely by sending a malicious serialized PythonUDF object,
  leading to remote code execution (RCE) on the master node."
