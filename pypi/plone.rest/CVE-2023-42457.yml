package_slug: "pypi/plone.rest"
title: "Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling"
description: "plone.rest allows users to use HTTP verbs such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE,
  etc. in Plone. Starting in the 2.x branch and prior to versions 2.0.1 and 3.0.1,
  when the `++api++` traverser is accidentally used multiple times in a url, handling
  it takes increasingly longer, making the server less responsive. Patches are available
  in `plone.rest` 2.0.1 and 3.0.1. Series 1.x is not affected. As a workaround, one
  may redirect `/++api++/++api++` to `/++api++` in one's frontend web server (nginx,
  Apache).\n"
