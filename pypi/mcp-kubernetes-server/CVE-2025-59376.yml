package_slug: "pypi/mcp-kubernetes-server"
title: "mcp-kubernetes-server has a Command Injection vulnerability"
description: "`mcp-kubernetes-server` does not correctly enforce the `--disable-write`
  / `--disable-delete` protections when commands are chained. The server only inspects
  the first token to decide whether an operation is write/delete, which allows a read-like
  command to be followed by a write action using shell metacharacters (e.g., `kubectl
  version; kubectl delete pod <name>`). A remote attacker who can invoke the server
  may therefore bypass the intended write/delete restrictions and perform state-changing
  operations against the Kubernetes cluster.\n\n**Affected versions:** through `0.1.11`
  (no patched release available as of now).\n\n**Mitigations:**\n- Run with `--disable-kubectl`
  and/or `--disable-helm` to fully block those execution paths.\n- Put the server
  behind an allow-list proxy restricting allowed subcommands."
