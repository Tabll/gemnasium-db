identifier: "CVE-2020-26214"
package_slug: "pypi/alerta-server"
title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "In Alerta, users may be able to bypass LDAP authentication if they provide
  an empty password when Alerta server is configure to use LDAP as the authorization
  provider. Only deployments where LDAP servers are configured to allow unauthenticated
  authentication mechanism for anonymous authorization are affected. A fix has been
  implemented that returns HTTP Unauthorized response for any authentication attempts
  where the password field is empty. As a workaround LDAP administrators can disallow
  unauthenticated bind requests by clients."
