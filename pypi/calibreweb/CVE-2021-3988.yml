description: "A Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in janeczku/calibre-web,
  specifically in the file `edit_books.js`. The vulnerability occurs when editing
  book properties, such as uploading a cover or a format. The affected code directly
  inserts user input into the DOM without proper sanitization, allowing attackers

  stealing cookies. The issue is present in the code handling the `#btn-upload-cover`
  change event."
