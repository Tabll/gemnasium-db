title: "Langflow CORS misconfiguration enables Account Takeover and RCE"
description: "Langflow versions up to and including 1.6.9 contain a chained vulnerability
  that enables account takeover and remote code execution. An overly permissive CORS
  configuration (allow_origins='*' with allow_credentials=True) combined with a refresh
  token cookie configured as SameSite=None allows a malicious webpage to perform cross-origin
  requests that include credentials and successfully call the refresh endpoint. An
  attacker-controlled origin can therefore obtain fresh access_token / refresh_token
  pairs for a victim session. Obtained tokens permit access to authenticated endpoints
  — including built-in code-execution functionality — allowing the attacker to execute
  arbitrary code and achieve full system compromise."
