- "GHSA-33c7-2mpw-hg34"
package_slug: "pypi/uvicorn"
title: "Log injection in uvicorn"
description: "This affects all versions of package uvicorn. The request logger provided
  by the package is vulnerable to ASNI escape sequence injection. Whenever any HTTP
  request is received, the default behaviour of uvicorn is to log its details to either
  the console or a log file. When attackers request crafted URLs with percent-encoded
  escape sequences, the logging component will log the URL after it's been processed
  with urllib.parse.unquote, therefore converting any percent-encoded characters into
  their single-character equivalent, which can have special meaning in terminal emulators.
  By requesting URLs with crafted paths, attackers can: * Pollute uvicorn's access
  logs, therefore jeopardising the integrity of such files. * Use ANSI sequence codes
  to attempt to interact with the terminal emulator that's displaying the logs (either
  in real time or from a file)."
