title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "Apache Airflow Sqoop Provider, versions before 4.0.0, is affected by
  a vulnerability that allows an attacker pass parameters with the connections, which
  makes it possible to implement RCE attacks via ‘sqoop import --connect’, obtain
  airflow server permissions, etc. The attacker needs to be logged in and have authorization
  (permissions) to create/edit connections.\n\n It is recommended to upgrade to a
  version that is not affected.\nThis issue was reported independently by happyhacking-k,
  And Xie Jianming and LiuHui of Caiji Sec Team also reported it."
