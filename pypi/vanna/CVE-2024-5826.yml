title: "vanna vulnerable to remote code execution caused by prompt injection"
description: "In the latest version of vanna-ai/vanna, the `vanna.ask` function is
  vulnerable to remote code execution due to prompt injection. The root cause is the
  lack of a sandbox when executing LLM-generated code, allowing an attacker to manipulate
  the code executed by the `exec` function in `src/vanna/base/base.py`. This vulnerability
  can be exploited by an attacker to achieve remote code execution on the app backend
  server, potentially gaining full control of the server."
