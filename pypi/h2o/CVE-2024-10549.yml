title: "H2O Vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) via `/3/Parse` Endpoint"
description: "A vulnerability in the `/3/Parse` endpoint of h2oai/h2o-3 version 3.46.0.1
  allows for a denial of service (DoS) attack. The endpoint uses a user-specified
  string to construct a regular expression, which is then applied to another user-specified
  string. By sending multiple simultaneous requests, an attacker can exhaust all available
  threads, leading to a complete denial of service."
