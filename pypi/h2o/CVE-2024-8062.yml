title: "H2O Vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) via `HEAD` Request"
description: "A vulnerability in the typeahead endpoint of h2oai/h2o-3 version 3.46.0
  allows for a denial of service. The endpoint performs a `HEAD` request to verify
  the existence of a specified resource without setting a timeout. An attacker can
  exploit this by sending multiple requests to an attacker-controlled server that
  hangs, causing the application to block and become unresponsive to other requests."
