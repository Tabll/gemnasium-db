title: "H2O has an External Control of File Name or Path vulnerability"
description: "A vulnerability in h2oai/h2o-3 version 3.46.0.1 allows remote attackers
  to write arbitrary data to any file on the server. This is achieved by exploiting
  the `/3/Parse` endpoint to inject attacker-controlled data as the header of an empty
  file, which is then exported using the `/3/Frames/framename/export` endpoint. The
  impact of this vulnerability includes the potential for remote code execution and
  complete access to the system running h2o-3, as attackers can overwrite critical
  files such as private SSH keys or script files."
