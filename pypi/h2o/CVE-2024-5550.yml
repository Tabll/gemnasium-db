package_slug: "pypi/h2o"
title: "Arbitrary system path lookup in h20"
description: "In h2oai/h2o-3 version 3.40.0.4, an exposure of sensitive information
  vulnerability exists due to an arbitrary system path lookup feature. This vulnerability
  allows any remote user to view full paths in the entire file system where h2o-3
  is hosted. Specifically, the issue resides in the Typeahead API call, which when
  requested with a typeahead lookup of '/', exposes the root filesystem including
  directories such as /home, /usr, /bin, among others. This vulnerability could allow
  attackers to explore the entire filesystem, and when combined with a Local File
  Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability, could make exploitation of the server trivial."
