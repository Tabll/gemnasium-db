title: "H2O.ai H2O vulnerable to deserialization attacks via a JDBC Connection URL"
description: "H2O.ai H2O through 3.46.0.4 allows attackers to arbitrarily set the
  JDBC URL, leading to deserialization attacks, file reads, and command execution.
  Exploitation can occur when an attacker has access to post to the ImportSQLTable
  URI with a JSON document containing a connection_url property with any typical JDBC
  Connection URL attack payload such as one that uses queryInterceptors."
