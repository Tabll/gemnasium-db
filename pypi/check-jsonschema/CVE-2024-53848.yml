package_slug: "pypi/check-jsonschema"
title: "check-jsonschema default caching for remote schemas allows for cache confusion"
description: "The default cache strategy uses the basename of a remote schema as the
  name of the file in the cache, e.g. `https://example.org/schema.json` will be stored
  as `schema.json`. This naming allows for conflicts. If an attacker can get a user
  to run `check-jsonschema` against a malicious schema URL, e.g., `https://example.evil.org/schema.json`,
  they can insert their own schema into the cache and it will be picked up and used
  instead of the appropriate schema.\n\nSuch a cache confusion attack could be used
  to allow data to pass validation which should have been rejected."
