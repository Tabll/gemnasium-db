title: "Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in Apache Airflow FTP Provider"
description: "Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in Apache Airflow FTP
  Provider.\n\nThe FTP hook lacks complete certificate validation in FTP_TLS connections,
  which can potentially be leveraged. Implementing proper certificate validation by
  passing context=ssl.create_default_context() during FTP_TLS instantiation is used
  as mitigation to validate the certificates properly.\n\nThis issue affects Apache
  Airflow FTP Provider: before 3.7.0.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version
  3.7.0, which fixes the issue."
