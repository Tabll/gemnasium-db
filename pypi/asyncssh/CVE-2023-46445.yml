title: "AsyncSSH Rogue Extension Negotiation"
description: "An issue in AsyncSSH v2.14.0 and earlier allows attackers to control
  the extension info message (RFC 8308) via a man-in-the-middle attack.\n\n The rogue
  extension negotiation attack targets an AsyncSSH client connecting to any SSH server
  sending an extension info message. The attack exploits an implementation flaw in
  the AsyncSSH implementation to inject an extension info message chosen by the attacker
  and delete the original extension info message, effectively replacing it.\n\n A
  correct SSH implementation should not process an unauthenticated extension info
  message. However, the injected message is accepted due to flaws in AsyncSSH. AsyncSSH
  supports the server-sig-algs and global-requests-ok extensions. Hence, the attacker
  can downgrade the algorithm used for client authentication by meddling with the
  value of server-sig-algs (e.g. use of SHA-1 instead of SHA-2)."
