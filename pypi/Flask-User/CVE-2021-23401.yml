title: "Open Redirect in Flask-User"
description: "This affects all versions of package Flask-User. When using the `make_safe_url`
  function, it is possible to bypass URL validation and redirect a user to an arbitrary
  URL by providing multiple backslashes such as `/////evil.com/path` or `\\\\\\evil.com/path`.
  This vulnerability is only exploitable if an alternative WSGI server other than
  Werkzeug is used, or the default behaviour of Werkzeug is modified using `autocorrect_location_header=False`."
