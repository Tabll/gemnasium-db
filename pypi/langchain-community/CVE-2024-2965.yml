- "GHSA-3hjh-jh2h-vrg6"
package_slug: "pypi/langchain-community"
title: "Denial of service in langchain-community"
description: "Denial of service in `SitemapLoader` Document Loader in the `langchain-community`
  package, affecting versions below 0.2.5. The `parse_sitemap` method, responsible
  for parsing sitemaps and extracting URLs, lacks a mechanism to prevent infinite
  recursion when a sitemap URL refers to the current sitemap itself. This oversight
  allows for the possibility of an infinite loop, leading to a crash by exceeding
  the maximum recursion depth in Python. This vulnerability can be exploited to occupy
  server socket/port resources and crash the Python process, impacting the availability
  of services relying on this functionality."
