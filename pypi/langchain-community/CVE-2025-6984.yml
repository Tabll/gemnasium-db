title: "Langchain Community Vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) Attacks"
description: "The langchain-ai/langchain project, specifically the EverNoteLoader
  component, is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks due to insecure XML
  parsing. The vulnerability arises from the use of etree.iterparse() without disabling
  external entity references, which can lead to sensitive information disclosure.
  An attacker could exploit this by crafting a malicious XML payload that references
  local files, potentially exposing sensitive data such as /etc/passwd. This issue
  has been fixed in 0.3.27 of langchain-community."
