title: "LangChain Community SSRF vulnerability exists in RequestsToolkit component "
description: "A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the RequestsToolkit
  component of the langchain-community package (specifically, langchain_community.agent_toolkits.openapi.toolkit.RequestsToolkit)
  in langchain-ai/langchain version 0.0.27. This vulnerability occurs because the
  toolkit does not enforce restrictions on requests to remote internet addresses,
  allowing it to also access local addresses. As a result, an attacker could exploit
  this flaw to perform port scans, access local services, retrieve instance metadata
  from cloud environments (e.g., Azure, AWS), and interact with servers on the local
  network. This issue has been fixed in version 0.0.28."
