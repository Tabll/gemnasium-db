package_slug: "pypi/django-mfa3"
title: "Improper Authentication in django-mfa3"
description: "django-mfa3 is a library that implements multi factor authentication
  for the django web framework. It achieves this by modifying the regular login view.
  Django however has a second login view for its admin area. This second login view
  was not modified, so the multi factor authentication can be bypassed.\n\nYou are
  affected if you have activated both django-mfa3 (< 0.5.0) and django.contrib.admin
  and have not taken any other measures to prevent users from accessing the admin
  login view."
