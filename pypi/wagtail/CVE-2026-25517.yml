package_slug: "pypi/wagtail"
title: "Wagtail has improper permission handling on admin preview endpoints"
description: "Due to a missing permission check on the preview endpoints, a user with
  access to the Wagtail admin and knowledge of a model's fields can craft a form submission
  to obtain a preview rendering of any page, snippet or site setting object for which
  previews are enabled, consisting of any data of the user's choosing. The existing
  data of the object itself is not exposed, but depending on the nature of the template
  being rendered, this may expose other database contents that would otherwise only
  be accessible to users with edit access over the model. The vulnerability is not
  exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin."
