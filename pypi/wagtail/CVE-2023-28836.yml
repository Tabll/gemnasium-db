title: "Wagtail vulnerable to stored Cross-site Scripting attack via ModelAdmin views"
description: "A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists on ModelAdmin
  views within the Wagtail admin interface. A user with a limited-permission editor
  account for the Wagtail admin could potentially craft pages and documents that,
  when viewed by a user with higher privileges, could perform actions with that user's
  credentials. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without
  access to the Wagtail admin, and only affects sites with ModelAdmin enabled."
