identifier: "CVE-2020-15118"
package_slug: "pypi/wagtail"
title: "Cross-site Scripting"
description: "When a form page type is made available to Wagtail editors through the
  `wagtail.contrib.forms` app, and the page template is built using Django's standard
  form rendering helpers such as `form.as_p`, any HTML tags used within a form field's
  help text will be rendered unescaped in the page. Allowing HTML within help text
  is an intentional design decision by Django; however, as a matter of policy Wagtail
  does not allow editors to insert arbitrary HTML by default, as this could potentially
  be used to carry out cross-site scripting attacks, including privilege escalation."
