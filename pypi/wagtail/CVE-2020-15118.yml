package_slug: "pypi/wagtail"
title: "Cross-Site Scripting in Wagtail"
description: "When a form page type is made available to Wagtail editors through the
  `wagtail.contrib.forms` app, and the page template is built using Django's standard
  form rendering helpers such as `form.as_p` ([as directed in the documentation](https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/reference/contrib/forms/index.html#usage)),
  any HTML tags used within a form field's help text will be rendered unescaped in
  the page. Allowing HTML within help text is [an intentional design decision](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.Field.help_text)
  by Django; however, as a matter of policy Wagtail does not allow editors to insert
  arbitrary HTML by default, as this could potentially be used to carry out cross-site
  scripting attacks, including privilege escalation. This functionality should therefore
  not have been made available to editor-level users.\n\nThe vulnerability is not
  exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin."
