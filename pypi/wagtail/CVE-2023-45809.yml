title: "Wagtail vulnerable to disclosure of user names via admin bulk action views"
description: "Wagtail is an open source content management system built on Django.
  A user with a limited-permission editor account for the Wagtail admin can make a
  direct URL request to the admin view that handles bulk actions on user accounts.
  While authentication rules prevent the user from making any changes, the error message
  discloses the display names of user accounts, and by modifying URL parameters, the
  user can retrieve the display name for any user. The vulnerability is not exploitable
  by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin. Patched versions
  have been released as Wagtail 4.1.8 (LTS), 5.0.5 and 5.1.3. The fix is also included
  in Release Candidate 1 of the forthcoming Wagtail 5.2 release. Users are advised
  to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
