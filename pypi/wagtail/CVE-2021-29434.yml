package_slug: "pypi/wagtail"
title: "Improper validation of URLs ('Cross-site Scripting') in Wagtail rich text
  fields"
description: "When saving the contents of a rich text field in the admin interface,
  Wagtail does not apply server-side checks to ensure that link URLs use a valid protocol.
  A malicious user with access to the admin interface could thus craft a POST request
  to publish content with `javascript:` URLs containing arbitrary code. The vulnerability
  is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin."
