identifier: "CVE-2021-29434"
package_slug: "pypi/wagtail"
title: "Cross-site Scripting"
description: "When saving the contents of a rich text field in the admin interface,
  Wagtail does not apply server-side checks to ensure that link URLs use a valid protocol.
  A malicious user with access to the admin interface could thus craft a POST request
  to publish content with `javascript:` URLs containing arbitrary code. The vulnerability
  is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin.
  See referenced GitHub advisory for additional details, including a workaround. Patched
  versions have been released as Wagtail (for the branch) and Wagtail (for the current
  branch)."
