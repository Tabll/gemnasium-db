package_slug: "pypi/wagtail"
title: "Wagtail vulnerable to denial-of-service via memory exhaustion when uploading
  large files"
description: "A memory exhaustion bug exists in Wagtail's handling of uploaded images
  and documents. For both images and documents, files are loaded into memory during
  upload for additional processing. A user with access to upload images or documents
  through the Wagtail admin interface could upload a file so large that it results
  in a crash or denial of service.\n\nThe vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary
  site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin. It can only be exploited by admin
  users with permission to upload images or documents.\n\nImage uploads are [restricted
  to 10MB by default](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/reference/settings.html#wagtailimages-max-upload-size),
  however this validation only happens on the frontend and on the backend after the
  vulnerable code."
