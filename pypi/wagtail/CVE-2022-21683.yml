title: "Comment reply notifications sent to incorrect users"
description: "When notifications for new replies in comment threads are sent, they
  are sent to all users who have replied or commented anywhere on the site, rather
  than only in the relevant threads. This means that a user could listen in to new
  comment replies on pages they have not had editing access to, as long as they have
  left a comment or reply somewhere on the site."
