- "GHSA-xfrw-hxr5-ghqf"
package_slug: "pypi/wagtail"
title: "Cross-site Scripting in wagtail"
description: "When the `{% include_block %}` template tag is used to output the value
  of a plain-text StreamField block (`CharBlock`, `TextBlock` or a similar user-defined
  block derived from `FieldBlock`), and that block does not specify a template for
  rendering, the tag output is not properly escaped as HTML. This could allow users
  to insert arbitrary HTML or scripting. This vulnerability is only exploitable by
  users with the ability to author StreamField content (i.e. users with 'editor' access
  to the Wagtail admin)."
