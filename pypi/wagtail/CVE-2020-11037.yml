identifier: "CVE-2020-11037"
package_slug: "pypi/wagtail"
title: "Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization (Race
  Condition)"
description: "In Wagtail, a potential timing attack exists on pages or documents that
  have been protected with a shared password through Wagtail's \"Privacy\" controls.
  This password check is performed through a character-by-character string comparison,
  and so an attacker who is able to measure the time taken by this check to a high
  degree of accuracy could potentially use timing differences to gain knowledge of
  the password."
