title: "Authlib is vulnerable to Denial of Service via Oversized JOSE Segments"
description: "**Summary**\nAuthlib’s JOSE implementation accepts unbounded JWS/JWT
  header and signature segments. A remote attacker can craft a token whose base64url‑encoded
  header or signature spans hundreds of megabytes. During verification, Authlib decodes
  and parses the full input before it is rejected, driving CPU and memory consumption
  to hostile levels and enabling denial of service.\n\n**Impact**\n\n- Attack vector:
  unauthenticated network attacker submits a malicious JWS/JWT.\n\n- Effect: base64
  decode + JSON/crypto processing of huge buffers pegs CPU and allocates large amounts
  of RAM; a single request can exhaust service capacity.\n\n- Observed behaviour:
  on a test host, the legacy code verified a 500 MB header, consuming ~4 GB RSS and
  ~9 s CPU before failing.\n\n- Severity: High. CVSS v3.1: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
  (7.5).\n\nAffected Versions\nAuthlib ≤ 1.6.3 (and earlier) when verifying JWS/JWT
  tokens. Later snapshots with 256 KB header/signature limits are not affected.\n\n**Proof
  of concept**"
