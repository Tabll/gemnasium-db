title: "DoS with algorithms that use PBKDF2 due to unbounded PBES2 Count value"
description: "### Impact\nDenial of Service,\nApplications that allow the use of the
  PBKDF2 algorithm.\n\n### Patches\nA [patch](https://github.com/latchset/jwcrypto/commit/d2655d370586cb830e49acfb450f87598da60be8)
  is available that sets the maximum number of default rounds.\n\n### Workarounds\nApplications
  that do not need to use PBKDF2 should simply specify the algorithms use and exclude
  it from the list.\nApplications that need to use the algorithm should upgrade to
  the new version that allows to set a maximum rounds number.\n\n### Acknowledgement\nThe
  issues was reported by Jingcheng Yang and Jianjun Chen from Sichuan University\nand
