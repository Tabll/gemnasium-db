package_slug: "pypi/bugsink"
title: "Bugsink path traversal via event_id in ingestion"
description: "In affected versions, ingestion paths construct file locations directly
  from untrusted `event_id` input without validation. A specially crafted `event_id`
  can result in paths outside the intended directory, potentially allowing file overwrite
  or creation in arbitrary locations.\n\nSubmitting such input requires access to
  a valid DSN. While that limits exposure, DSNs are sometimes discoverable—for example,
  when included in frontend code—and should not be treated as a strong security boundary."
