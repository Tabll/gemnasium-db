title: "Session key exposure through session list in Django User Sessions"
description: "The views provided by django-user-sessions allow users to terminate
  specific sessions. The session key is used to identify sessions, and thus included
  in the rendered HTML. In itself this is not a problem. However if the website has
  an XSS vulnerability, the session key could be extracted by the attacker and a session
  takeover could happen."
