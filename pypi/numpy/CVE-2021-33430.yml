title: "NumPy Buffer Overflow (Disputed)"
description: "A Buffer Overflow vulnerability exists in NumPy 1.9.x in the PyArray_NewFromDescr_int
  function of ctors.c when specifying arrays of large dimensions (over 32) from Python
  code, which could let a malicious user cause a Denial of Service.\n\nNOTE: The vendor
  does not agree this is a vulnerability; In (very limited) circumstances a user may
  be able provoke the buffer overflow, the user is most likely already privileged
  to at least provoke denial of service by exhausting memory. Triggering this further
  requires the use of uncommon API (complicated structured dtypes), which is very
  unlikely to be available to an unprivileged user."
