identifier: "CVE-2021-21419"
package_slug: "pypi/eventlet"
title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "Eventlet is a concurrent networking library for Python. A websocket
  peer may exhaust memory on Eventlet side by sending very large websocket frames.
  Malicious peer may exhaust memory on Eventlet side by sending highly compressed
  data frame. A patch restricts websocket frame to reasonable limits. As a workaround,
  restricting memory usage via OS limits would help against overall machine exhaustion,
  but there is no workaround to protect Eventlet process."
