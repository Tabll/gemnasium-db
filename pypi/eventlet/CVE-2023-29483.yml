package_slug: "pypi/eventlet"
title: "Potential DoS via the Tudoor mechanism in eventlet and dnspython"
description: "eventlet before 0.35.2, as used in dnspython before 2.6.0, allows remote
  attackers to interfere with DNS name resolution by quickly sending an invalid packet
  from the expected IP address and source port, aka a \"TuDoor\" attack. In other
  words, dnspython does not have the preferred behavior in which the DNS name resolution
  algorithm would proceed, within the full time window, in order to wait for a valid
  packet. NOTE: dnspython 2.6.0 is unusable for a different reason that was addressed
  in 2.6.1."
