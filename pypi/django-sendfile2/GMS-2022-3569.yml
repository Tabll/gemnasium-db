title: "django-sendfile2 before 0.7.0 contains reflected file download vulnerability"
description: "Similar to CVE-2022-36359 for Django, django-sendfile2 does not protect
  against a reflected file download attack in version 0.6.1 and earlier. If the file
  name used by django-sendfile2 was derived from user input, then it would be possible
  to perform a such an attack. A new version of django-sendfile2 will be released.
  Either download django-sendfile2 0.7.0 as a workaround or sanitize user input yourself,
  using Django's patch as a template: https://github.com/django/django/commit/bd062445cffd3f6cc6dcd20d13e2abed818fa173"
