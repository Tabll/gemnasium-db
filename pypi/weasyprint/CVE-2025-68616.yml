title: "WeasyPrint has a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Protection Bypass via
  HTTP Redirect"
description: "A **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Protection Bypass** exists in
  WeasyPrint's `default_url_fetcher`. The vulnerability allows attackers to access
  internal network resources (such as `localhost` services or cloud metadata endpoints)
  even when a developer has implemented a custom `url_fetcher` to block such access.
  This occurs because the underlying `urllib` library follows HTTP redirects automatically
  without re-validating the new destination against the developer's security policy."
