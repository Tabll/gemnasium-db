title: "reflex-dev/reflex has an Open Redirect vulnerability"
description: "---\n\n**Phishing/Social Engineering Attacks**\n\n\nUsers can be exploited
  by immediately redirecting from a trusted domain to external malicious sites, taking
  advantage of user trust. This enables login page spoofing, credential harvesting,
  and redirection to malware distribution pages.\n\n**Authentication/Session Flow
  Disruption**\n\n\nWhen users with valid sessions/cookies from the same origin click
  the link, they are redirected to unintended external domains, which can bypass or
  disrupt authentication/authorization flows. When combined with redirect-based flows
  like OAuth/OIDC, this can escalate into security incidents."
