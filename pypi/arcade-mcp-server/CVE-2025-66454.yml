package_slug: "pypi/arcade-mcp-server"
title: "arcade-mcp-server Has Default Hardcoded Worker Secret That Allows Full Unauthorized
  Access to All HTTP MCP Worker Endpoints"
description: "The arcade-mcp HTTP server uses a hardcoded default worker secret (\"dev\")
  that is never validated or overridden during normal server startup. As a result,
  any unauthenticated attacker who knows this default key can forge valid JWTs and
  fully bypass the FastAPI authentication layer. This grants remote access to all
  worker endpoints—including tool enumeration and tool invocation—without credentials.\n\nAnyone
  following the official quick-start guide is vulnerable unless they manually override
  ARCADE_WORKER_SECRET."
