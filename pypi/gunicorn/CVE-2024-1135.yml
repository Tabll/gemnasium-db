title: "Request smuggling leading to endpoint restriction bypass in Gunicorn"
description: "Gunicorn fails to properly validate Transfer-Encoding headers, leading
  to HTTP Request Smuggling (HRS) vulnerabilities. By crafting requests with conflicting
  Transfer-Encoding headers, attackers can bypass security restrictions and access
  restricted endpoints. This issue is due to Gunicorn's handling of Transfer-Encoding
  headers, where it incorrectly processes requests with multiple, conflicting Transfer-Encoding
  headers, treating them as chunked regardless of the final encoding specified. This
  vulnerability has been shown to allow access to endpoints restricted by gunicorn.\n\nTo
  be affected users must have a network path which does not filter out invalid requests.
  These users are advised to block access to restricted endpoints via a firewall or
  other mechanism until a fix can be developed."
