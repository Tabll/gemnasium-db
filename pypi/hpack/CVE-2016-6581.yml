title: "HPACK Denial of Service vulnerability (HPACK Bomb)"
description: "A HTTP/2 implementation built using any version of the Python HPACK
  library between v1.0.0 and v2.2.0 could be targeted for a denial of service attack,
  specifically a so-called \"HPACK Bomb\" attack. This attack occurs when an attacker
  inserts a header field that is exactly the size of the HPACK dynamic header table
  into the dynamic header table. The attacker can then send a header block that is
  simply repeated requests to expand that field in the dynamic table. This can lead
  to a gigantic compression ratio of 4,096 or better, meaning that 16kB of data can
  decompress to 64MB of data on the target machine."
