title: "WebOb's location header normalization during redirect leads to open redirect"
description: "When WebOb normalizes the HTTP Location header to include the request
  hostname, it does so by parsing the URL that the user is to be redirected to with
  Python's urlparse, and joining it to the base URL. `urlparse` however treats a `//`
  at the start of a string as a URI without a scheme, and then treats the next part
  as the hostname. `urljoin` will then use that hostname from the second part as the
  hostname replacing the original one from the request.\n\n```\n>>> parse.urlparse(\"//example.com/test/path\")\nParseResult(scheme='',
  netloc='example.com', path='/test/path', params='', query='', fragment='')\n```\n\nWebOb
  uses `urljoin` to take the request URI and joining the redirect location, so assuming
  the request URI is: `https://example.org//example.com/some/path`, and the URL to
  redirect to (for example by adding a slash automatically) is `//example.com/some/path/`
  that gets turned by `urljoin` into:\n\n```\n>>> parse.urljoin(\"https://example.org//attacker.com/some/path\",
  \"//attacker.com/some/path/\")\n'https://attacker.com/some/path/'\n```\n\nWhich
  redirects from `example.org` where we want the user to stay to `attacker.com`"
