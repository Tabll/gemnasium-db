title: "JWT Verification bypass"
description: "It is possible for an attacker to bypass verification when \"a token
  digitally signed with an asymetric key (RS/ES family) of algorithms but instead
  the attacker send a token digitally signed with a symmetric algorithm (HS* family)\".
  It is also possible for an attacker to create his own signed token with any payload
  he wants and have it considered valid using the \"none\" algorithm."
