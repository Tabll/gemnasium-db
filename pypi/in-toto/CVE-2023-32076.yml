title: "External Control of System or Configuration Setting"
description: "in-toto is a framework to protect supply chain integrity. The in-toto
  configuration is read from various directories and allows users to configure the
  behavior of the framework. The files are from directories following the XDG base
  directory specification. In versions 1.4.0 and prior, among the files read is `.in_totorc`
  which is a hidden file in the directory in which in-toto is run. If an attacker
  controls the inputs to a supply chain step, they can mask their activities by also
  passing in an `.in_totorc` file that includes the necessary exclude patterns and
  settings. RC files are widely used in other systems and security issues have been
  discovered in their implementations as well. Maintainers found in their conversations
  with in-toto adopters that `in_totorc` is not their preferred way to configure in-toto.
  As none of the options supported in `in_totorc` is unique, and can be set elsewhere
  using API parameters or CLI arguments, the maintainers decided to drop support for
  `in_totorc`. in-toto's `user_settings` module has been dropped altogether in commit
  3a21d84f40811b7d191fa7bd17265c1f99599afd. Users may also sandbox functionary code
  as a security measure."
