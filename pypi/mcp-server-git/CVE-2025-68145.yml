package_slug: "pypi/mcp-server-git"
title: "mcp-server-git has missing path validation when using --repository flag"
description: "In mcp-server-git versions prior to 2025.12.17, when the server is started
  with the --repository flag to restrict operations to a specific repository path,
  it did not validate that repo_path arguments in subsequent tool calls were actually
  within that configured path. This could allow tool calls to operate on other repositories
  accessible to the server process. The fix adds path validation that resolves both
  the configured repository and the requested path (following symlinks) and verifies
  the requested path is within the allowed repository before executing any git operations.
  Users are advised to upgrade to 2025.12.17 upon release to remediate this issue.\n\nThank
  you to https://hackerone.com/yardenporat for reporting."
