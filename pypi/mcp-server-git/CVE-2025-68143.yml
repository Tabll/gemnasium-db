package_slug: "pypi/mcp-server-git"
title: "mcp-server-git's unrestricted git_init tool allows repository creation at
  arbitrary filesystem locations"
description: "In mcp-server-git versions prior to 2025.9.25, the git_init tool accepted
  arbitrary filesystem paths and created Git repositories without validating the target
  location. Unlike other tools which required an existing repository, git_init could
  operate on any directory accessible to the server process, making those directories
  eligible for subsequent git operations. The tool was removed entirely, as the server
  is intended to operate on existing repositories only. Users are advised to upgrade
  to 2025.9.25 or newer to remediate this issue.\n\nThank you to https://hackerone.com/yardenporat
  for disclosure, @0dd for contributing the fix."
