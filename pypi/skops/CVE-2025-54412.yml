title: "Skops has Inconsistent Trusted Type Validation that Enables Hidden `operator`
  Methods Execution"
description: "An inconsistency in `OperatorFuncNode` can be exploited to hide the
  execution of untrusted `operator.xxx` methods. This can then be used in a code reuse
  attack to invoke seemingly safe functions and escalate to arbitrary code execution
  with minimal and misleading trusted types.\n\n**Note:** This report focuses on `operator.call`
  as it appears to be the most interesting target, but the same technique applies
  to other `operator` methods. Moreover, focusing on a specific example is not necessary,
  the `operator.call` invocation was a zero-effort choice meant solely to demonstrate
  the issue. The key point is the **inconsistency** that allows a user to approve
  a type as trusted, while in reality enabling the execution of `operator.xxx`."
