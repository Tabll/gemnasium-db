title: "SKOPS Card.get_model happily allows arbitrary code execution"
description: "When using `Card.get_model`, `skops` allows for arbitrary code execution.
  This is due to the fact that `Card.get_model` allows both `joblib` and `skops` to
  be used for loading models, and as is well known, `joblib` allows for arbitrary
  code execution when loading objects. I do not know if this is intended or not, but
  I found this really concerning for a library that is founded on security. Even if
  intended, I kindly ask you to consider the security implications of this, disclose
  the potential implications through an advisory, and change the behavior of the function
  in future library versions (see below for possible fixes)."
