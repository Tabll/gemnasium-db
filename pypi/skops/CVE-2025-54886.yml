package_slug: "pypi/skops"
title: "SKOPS Card.get_model happily allows arbitrary code execution"
description: "The `Card` class of `skops`, used for model documentation and sharing,
  allows arbitrary code execution. When a file other than `.zip` is provided to the
  `Card` class during instantiation, the internally invoked `Card.get_model` method
  silently falls back to `joblib` without warning. Unlike the `.skops` zip-based format,
  `joblib` permits unrestricted code execution, hence bypassing the security measures
  of `skops` and enabling the execution of malicious code."
