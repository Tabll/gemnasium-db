title: "Skops may allow MethodNode to access unexpected object fields through dot
  notation, leading to arbitrary code execution at load time"
description: "An inconsistency in `MethodNode` can be exploited to access unexpected
  object fields through dot notation. This can be used to achieve **arbitrary code
  execution at load time**.\n\nWhile this issue may seem similar to https://github.com/skops-dev/skops/security/advisories/GHSA-m7f4-hrc6-fwg3,
  it is actually more severe, as it relies on fewer assumptions about trusted types."
