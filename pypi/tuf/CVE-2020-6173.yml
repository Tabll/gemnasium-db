package_slug: "pypi/tuf"
title: "Client Denial of Service on TUF"
description: "An attacker who can gain file access to the repository and modify metadata
  files may cause a denial of service to clients by creating many invalid signatures
  on a metadata file. Having a large number of signatures to verify will delay the
  moment when the client will determine the signature is not valid. This delay may
  be for at least a few minutes, but possibly could be longer especially if multiple
  files are impacted.\n\nThe tuf maintainers would like to thank Erik MacLean of Analog
  Devices, Inc. for reporting this issue."
