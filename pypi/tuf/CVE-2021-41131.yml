title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "python-tuf is a Python reference implementation of The Update Framework
  (TUF). In both clients (`tuf/client` and `tuf/ngclient`), there is a path traversal
  vulnerability that in the worst case can overwrite files ending in `.json` anywhere
  on the client system on a call to `get_one_valid_targetinfo()`. It occurs because
  the rolename is used to form the filename, and may contain path traversal characters
  (ie `../../name.json`). The impact is mitigated by a few facts: It only affects
  implementations that allow arbitrary rolename selection for delegated targets metadata,
  The attack requires the ability to A) insert new metadata for the path-traversing
  role and B) get the role delegated by an existing targets metadata, The written
  file content is heavily restricted since it needs to be a valid, signed targets
  file. The file extension is always .json. A fix is available or newer. There are
  no workarounds that do not require code changes. Clients can restrict the allowed
  character set for rolenames, or they can store metadata in files named in a way
  that is not vulnerable: neither of these approaches is possible without modifying
  python-tuf."
