title: "Client metadata path-traversal"
description: "In both clients (`tuf/client` and `tuf/ngclient`), there is a path traversal
  vulnerability that in the worst case can overwrite files ending in `.json` anywhere
  on the client system on a call to `get_one_valid_targetinfo()`. It occurs because
  the rolename is used to form the filename, and may contain path traversal characters
  (ie `../../name.json`).\n\nThe impact is mitigated by a few facts:\n* It only affects
  implementations that allow arbitrary rolename selection for delegated targets metadata\n*
  The attack requires the ability to A) insert new metadata for the path-traversing
  role and B) get the role delegated by an existing targets metadata\n* The written
  file content is heavily restricted since it needs to be a valid, signed targets
  file. The file extension is always .json."
