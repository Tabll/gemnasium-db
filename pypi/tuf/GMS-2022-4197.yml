title: "Python-TUF vulnerable to incorrect threshold signature computation for new
  root metadata"
description: "The function _verify_root_self_signed(), introduced in v0.14.0, and 
  which verifies self-signatures in a new root metadata file, counted multiple 
  signatures by any new root key towards the new threshold. That is, any single 
  new root key could theoretically provide enough signatures to meet the threshold 
  for new key self-signatures required during root metadata update. 
  
  A scenario where this attack could be relevant is amazingly unlikely in practice 
  to the point where labeling this issue as a security advisory is potentially 
  overstating the impact of the issue. Given that new root keys only become trusted 
  by the client after a successful root metadata update, which also requires the quorum 
  of signatures from old trusted root keys, this issue has been evaluated as low in 
  severity."
