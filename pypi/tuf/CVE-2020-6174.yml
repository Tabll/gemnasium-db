package_slug: "pypi/tuf"
title: "Incorrect threshold signature computation in TUF"
description: "Metadadata signature verification, as used in `tuf.client.updater`,
  counted each of multiple signatures with identical authorized keyids  separately
  towards the threshold. Therefore, an attacker with access to a valid signing key
  could create multiple valid signatures in order to meet the minimum threshold of
  keys before the metadata was considered valid.\n\nThe tuf maintainers would like
  to thank Erik MacLean of Analog Devices, Inc. for reporting this issue."
