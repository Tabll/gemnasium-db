title: "Invalid root may become trusted root in The Update Framework (TUF)"
description: "The Python TUF reference implementation `tuf<0.12` will incorrectly
  trust a previously downloaded root metadata file which failed verification at download
  time. This allows an attacker who is able to serve multiple new versions of root
  metadata (i.e. by a man-in-the-middle attack) culminating in a version which has
  not been correctly signed to control the trust chain for future updates.\n\nWhile
  investigating the reported vulnerability, we discovered that the detailed client
  workflow was not fully implemented. Specifically, for step 1.3 the newly downloaded
  root metadata was not being verified with a threshold of keys specified in the new
  root metadata file.\nThis missing step of the client workflow has been implemented
  in [PR #1101](https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/pull/1101), which is included
  in [v0.14.0](https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/releases/tag/v0.14.0) of
  tuf."
