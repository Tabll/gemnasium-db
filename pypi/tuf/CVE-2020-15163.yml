title: "Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity"
description: "Python TUF (The Update Framework) reference implementation it will incorrectly
  trust a previously downloaded root metadata file which failed verification at download
  time. This allows an attacker who is able to serve multiple new versions of root
  metadata (i.e. by a person-in-the-middle attack) culminating in a version which
  has not been correctly signed to control the trust chain for future updates. This
  is fixed and newer."
