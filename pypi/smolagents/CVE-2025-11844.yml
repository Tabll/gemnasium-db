title: "Hugging Face Smolagents XPath injection vulnerability in the search_item_ctrl_f
  function"
description: "Hugging Face Smolagents version 1.20.0 contains an XPath injection vulnerability
  in the search_item_ctrl_f function located in src/smolagents/vision_web_browser.py.
  The function constructs an XPath query by directly concatenating user-supplied input
  into the XPath expression without proper sanitization or escaping. This allows an
  attacker to inject malicious XPath syntax that can alter the intended query logic.
  The vulnerability enables attackers to bypass search filters, access unintended
  DOM elements, and disrupt web automation workflows. This can lead to information
  disclosure, manipulation of AI agent interactions, and compromise the reliability
  of automated web tasks. The issue is fixed in version 1.22.0."
