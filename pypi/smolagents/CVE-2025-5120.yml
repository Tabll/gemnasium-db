title: "smolagents has Sandbox Escape Vulnerability in the local_python_executor.py
  Module"
description: "A sandbox escape vulnerability was identified in huggingface/smolagents
  version 1.14.0, allowing attackers to bypass the restricted execution environment
  and achieve remote code execution (RCE). The vulnerability stems from the local_python_executor.py
  module, which inadequately restricts Python code execution despite employing static
  and dynamic checks. Attackers can exploit approved modules and functions to execute
  arbitrary code, compromising the host system. This flaw undermines the core security
  boundary intended to isolate untrusted code, posing risks such as unauthorized code
  execution, data leakage, and potential integration-level compromise. The issue is
  resolved in version 1.17.0."
