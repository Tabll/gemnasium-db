package_slug: "pypi/Flask"
title: "Flask vulnerable to possible disclosure of permanent session cookie due to
  missing Vary: Cookie header"
description: "When all of the following conditions are met, a response containing
  data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by a proxy to other
  clients. If the proxy also caches `Set-Cookie` headers, it may send one client's
  `session` cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use
  of the session, and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on
  _all_ these conditions being met."
