title: "Flask vulnerable to possible disclosure of permanent session cookie due to
  missing Vary: Cookie header"
description: "When all of the following conditions are met, a response containing
  data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by a proxy to other
  clients. If the proxy also caches `Set-Cookie` headers, it may send one client's
  `session` cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use
  of the session, and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on
  _all_ these conditions being met.\n\n1. The application must be hosted behind a
  caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies.\n2.
  The application sets [`session.permanent = True`](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/api/#flask.session.permanent).\n2.
  The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request.\n4.
  [`SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/config/#SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST)
  is enabled (the default).\n5. The application does not set a `Cache-Control` header
  to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.\n\nThis happens because
  vulnerable versions of Flask only set the `Vary: Cookie` header when the session
  is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration)
  without being accessed or modified."
