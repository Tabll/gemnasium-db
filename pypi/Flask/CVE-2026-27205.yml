title: "Flask session does not add `Vary: Cookie` header when accessed in some ways"
description: "When the `session` object is accessed, Flask should set the `Vary: Cookie`
  header. This instructs caches not to cache the response, as it may contain information
  specific to a logged in user. This is handled in most cases, but some forms of access
  such as the Python `in` operator were overlooked.\n\nThe severity depends on the
  application's use of the session, and the cache's behavior regarding cookies. The
  risk depends on all these conditions being met.\n\n1. The application must be hosted
  behind a caching proxy that does not ignore responses with cookies.\n2. The application
  does not set a `Cache-Control` header to indicate that a page is private or should
  not be cached.\n3. The application accesses the session in a way that does not access
  the values, only the keys, and does not mutate the session."
