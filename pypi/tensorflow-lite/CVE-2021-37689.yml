title: "NULL Pointer Dereference"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  which would result in a crash and denial of service. This is caused by the MLIR
  optimization of `L2NormalizeReduceAxis` operator. The implementation
  unconditionally dereferences a pointer to an iterator to a vector without checking
  that the vector has elements. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit d6b57f461b39fd1aa8c1b870f1b974aac3554955.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow,
  TensorFlow, and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still in supported range."
