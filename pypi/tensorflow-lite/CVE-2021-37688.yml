title: "NULL Pointer Dereference"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  which would result in a crash and denial of service. The implementation
  unconditionally dereferences a pointer. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
  e456c7dc9bd6be203b09765b063bf4a380c. The fix will be included in TensorFlow We will
  also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow, TensorFlow, and TensorFlow, as these
  are also affected and still in supported range."
