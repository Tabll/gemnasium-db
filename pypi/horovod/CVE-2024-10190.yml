package_slug: "pypi/horovod"
title: "Horovod Vulnerable to Command Injection"
description: "Horovod versions up to and including v0.28.1 are vulnerable to unauthenticated
  remote code execution. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of base64-encoded
  data in the `ElasticRendezvousHandler`, a subclass of `KVStoreHandler`. Specifically,
  the `_put_value` method in `ElasticRendezvousHandler` calls `codec.loads_base64(value)`,
  which eventually invokes `cloudpickle.loads(decoded)`. This allows an attacker to
  send a malicious pickle object via a PUT request, leading to arbitrary code execution
  on the server."
