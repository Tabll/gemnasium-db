package_slug: "pypi/binderhub"
title: "remote code execution via git repo provider"
description: "A remote code execution vulnerability has been identified in BinderHub,
  where providing BinderHub with maliciously crafted input could execute code in the
  BinderHub context, with the potential to egress credentials of the BinderHub deployment,
  including JupyterHub API tokens, kubernetes service accounts, and docker registry
  credentials. This may provide the ability to manipulate images and other user created
  pods in the deployment, with the potential to escalate to the host depending on
  the underlying kubernetes configuration."
