identifier: "CVE-2021-39159"
package_slug: "pypi/binderhub"
title: "Code Injection"
description: "BinderHub is a kubernetes-based cloud service that allows users to share
  reproducible interactive computing environments from code repositories. where providing
  BinderHub with maliciously crafted input could execute code in the BinderHub context,
  with the potential to egress credentials of the BinderHub deployment, including
  JupyterHub API tokens, kubernetes service accounts, and docker registry credentials.
  This may provide the ability to manipulate images and other user created pods in
  the deployment, with the potential to escalate to the host depending on the underlying
  kubernetes configuration. If users are unable to update they may disable the git
  repo provider by specifying the `BinderHub.repo_providers` as a workaround."
