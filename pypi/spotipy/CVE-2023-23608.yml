package_slug: "pypi/spotipy"
title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "Spotipy is a light weight Python library for the Spotify Web API. In
  versions prior to 2.22.1, if a malicious URI is passed to the library, the library
  can be tricked into performing an operation on a different API endpoint than intended.
  The code Spotipy uses to parse URIs and URLs allows an attacker to insert arbitrary
  characters into the path that is used for API requests. Because it is possible to
  include \"..\", an attacker can redirect for example a track lookup via spotifyApi.track()
  to an arbitrary API endpoint like playlists, but this is possible for other endpoints
  as well. The impact of this vulnerability depends heavily on what operations a client
  application performs when it handles a URI from a user and how it uses the responses
  it receives from the API. This issue is patched in version 2.22.1."
