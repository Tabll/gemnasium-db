package_slug: "pypi/PyInstaller"
title: "PyInstaller has local privilege escalation vulnerability"
description: "Due to a special entry being appended to `sys.path` during the bootstrap
  process of a PyInstaller-frozen application, and due to the bootstrap script attempting
  to load an optional module for bytecode decryption while this entry is still present
  in `sys.path`, an application built with PyInstaller < 6.0.0 may be tricked by an
  unprivileged attacker into executing arbitrary python code when **all** of the following
  conditions are met:\n\n1. Application is built with PyInstaller < 6.0.0; both onedir
  and onefile mode are affected.\n2. Optional bytecode encryption code feature was
  **not** enabled during the application build.\n3. The attacker can create files/directories
  in the same directory where the executable is located.\n4. The filesystem supports
  creation of files/directories that contain `?` in their name (i.e., non-Windows
  systems).\n5. The attacker is able to determine the offset at which the PYZ archive
  is embedded in the executable.\n\nThe attacker can create a directory (or a zip
  archive) next to the executable, with the name that matches the format used by PyInstaller's
  bootloader to transmit information about the location of PYZ archive to the bootstrap
  script. If this directory (or zip archive) contains a python module whose name matches
  the name used by the optional bytecode encryption feature, this module will be loaded
  and executed by the bootstrap script (in the absence of the real, built-in module
  that is available when the bytecode-encryption feature is enabled). This results
  in arbitrary code execution that requires no modification of the executable itself.\n\nIf
  the executable is running with elevated privileges (for example, due to having the
  `setuid` bit set), the code in the injected module is also executed with the said
  elevated privileges, resulting in a local privilege escalation."
