identifier: "CVE-2019-16784"
package_slug: "pypi/PyInstaller"
title: "Improper Privilege Management"
description: "In PyInstaller before version, only on Windows, a local privilege escalation
  vulnerability is present in this particular case. A software using PyInstaller in
  `onefile` mode can be launched by a privileged user (at least more than the current
  one) so that `TempPath` may become a world writable directory. This is the case
  for example if the software is launched as a service or as a scheduled task using
  a system account. In order to be exploitable the software has to be (re)started
  after the attacker launch the exploit program, so for a service launched at startup,
  a service restart is needed (e.g. after a crash or an upgrade)."
