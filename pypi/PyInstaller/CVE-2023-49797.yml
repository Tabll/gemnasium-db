package_slug: "pypi/PyInstaller"
title: "Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource"
description: "PyInstaller bundles a Python application and all its dependencies into
  a single package. A PyInstaller built application, elevated as a privileged process,
  may be tricked by an unprivileged attacker into deleting files the unprivileged
  user does not otherwise have access to. A user is affected if **all** the following
  are satisfied: 1. The user runs an application containing either `matplotlib` or
  `win32com`. 2. The application is ran as administrator (or at least a user with
  higher privileges than the attacker). 3. The user's temporary directory is not locked
  to that specific user (most likely due to `TMP`/`TEMP` environment variables pointing
  to an unprotected, arbitrary, non default location). Either: A. The attacker is
  able to very carefully time the replacement of a temporary file with a symlink.
  This switch must occur exactly between `shutil.rmtree()`'s builtin symlink check
  and the deletion itself B: The application was built with Python 3.7.x or earlier
  which has no protection against Directory Junctions links. The vulnerability has
  been addressed in PR #7827 which corresponds to `pyinstaller >= 5.13.1`. Users are
  advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
