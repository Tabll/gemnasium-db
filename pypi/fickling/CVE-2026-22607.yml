title: "Fickling Blocklist Bypass: cProfile.run()"
description: "Fickling versions up to and including 0.1.6 do not treat Python's `cProfile`
  module as unsafe. Because of this, a malicious pickle that uses `cProfile.run()`
  is classified as SUSPICIOUS instead of OVERTLY_MALICIOUS.\n\nIf a user relies on
  Fickling's output to decide whether a pickle is safe to deserialize, this misclassification
  can lead them to execute attacker-controlled code on their system.\n\nThis affects
  any workflow or product that uses Fickling as a security gate for pickle deserialization."
