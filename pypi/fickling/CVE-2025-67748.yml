title: "Fickling has Code Injection vulnerability via pty.spawn()"
description: "An unsafe deserialization vulnerability in Fickling allows a crafted
  pickle file to bypass the \"unused variable\" heuristic, enabling arbitrary code
  execution. This bypass is achieved by adding a trivial operation to the pickle file
  that \"uses\" the otherwise unused variable left on the stack after a malicious
  operation, tricking the detection mechanism into classifying the file as safe."
