package_slug: "pypi/fickling"
title: "Fickling has a bypass via runpy.run_path() and runpy.run_module()"
description: "Fickling versions up to and including 0.1.6 do not treat Python’s runpy
  module as unsafe. Because of this, a malicious pickle that uses runpy.run_path()
  or runpy.run_module() is classified as SUSPICIOUS instead of OVERTLY_MALICIOUS.\n\nIf
  a user relies on Fickling’s output to decide whether a pickle is safe to deserialize,
  this misclassification can lead them to execute attacker-controlled code on their
  system.\n\nThis affects any workflow or product that uses Fickling as a security
  gate for pickle deserialization."
