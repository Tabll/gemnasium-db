package_slug: "pypi/torchserve"
title: "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
description: "TorchServe is a tool for serving and scaling PyTorch models in production.
  TorchServe default configuration lacks proper input validation, enabling third parties
  to invoke remote HTTP download requests and write files to the disk. This issue
  could be taken advantage of to compromise the integrity of the system and sensitive
  data. This issue is present in versions 0.1.0 to 0.8.1. A user is able to load the
  model of their choice from any URL that they would like to use. The user of TorchServe
  is responsible for configuring both the allowed_urls and specifying the model URL
  to be used. A pull request to warn the user when the default value for allowed_urls
  is used has been merged in PR #2534. TorchServe release 0.8.2 includes this change.
  Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue."
