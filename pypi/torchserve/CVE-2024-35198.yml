package_slug: "pypi/torchserve"
title: "TorchServe vulnerable to bypass of allowed_urls configuration"
description: "TorchServe's check on allowed_urls configuration can be by-passed if
  the URL contains characters such as \"..\" but it does not prevent the model from
  being downloaded into the model store. Once a file is downloaded, it can be referenced
  without providing a URL the second time, which effectively bypasses the allowed_urls
  security check. Customers using PyTorch inference Deep Learning Containers (DLC)
  through Amazon SageMaker and EKS are not affected."
