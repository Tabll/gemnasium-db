title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "Apache Superset would allow for SQLite database connections to be incorrectly
  registered when an attacker uses alternative driver names like sqlite+pysqlite or
  by using database imports. This could allow for unexpected file creation on Superset
  webservers. Additionally, if Apache Superset is using a SQLite database for its
  metadata (not advised for production use) it could result in more severe vulnerabilities
  related to confidentiality and integrity. This vulnerability exists in Apache Superset
  versions up to and including 2.1.0."
