title: "DB-GPT Absolute Path Traversal vulnerability"
description: "In eosphoros-ai/db-gpt version 0.6.0, the endpoint for uploading files
  is vulnerable to absolute path traversal. This vulnerability allows an attacker
  to upload arbitrary files to arbitrary locations on the target server. The issue
  arises because the `file_key` and `doc_file.filename` parameters are user-controllable,
  enabling the construction of paths outside the intended directory. This can lead
  to overwriting essential system files, such as SSH keys, for further exploitation."
