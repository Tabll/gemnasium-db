title: "DB-GPT vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery"
description: "In version 0.6.0 of eosphoros-ai/db-gpt, the `uvicorn` app created by
  `dbgpt_server` uses an overly permissive instance of `CORSMiddleware` which sets
  the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to `*` for all requests. This configuration makes
  all endpoints exposed by the server vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
  An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to interact with any endpoints of the
  instance, even if the instance is not publicly exposed to the network."
