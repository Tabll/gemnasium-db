title: "DB-GPT Path Traversal vulnerability"
description: "A Path Traversal vulnerability exists in the eosphoros-ai/db-gpt version
  0.6.0 at the API endpoint `/v1/resource/file/delete`. This vulnerability allows
  an attacker to delete any file on the server by manipulating the `file_key` parameter.
  The `file_key` parameter is not properly sanitized, enabling an attacker to specify
  arbitrary file paths. If the specified file exists, the application will delete
  it."
