title: "DB-GPT Absolute Path Traversal in knowledge/{space_name}/document/upload"
description: "eosphoros-ai/db-gpt version 0.6.0 is vulnerable to an arbitrary file
  write through the knowledge API. The endpoint for uploading files as 'knowledge'
  is susceptible to absolute path traversal, allowing attackers to write files to
  arbitrary locations on the target server. This vulnerability arises because the
  'doc_file.filename' parameter is user-controllable, enabling the construction of
  absolute paths."
