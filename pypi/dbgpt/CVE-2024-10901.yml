title: "DB-GPT Arbitrary File Write vulnerability"
description: "In eosphoros-ai/db-gpt version v0.6.3 and earlier, the web API `POST
  /api/v1/editor/chart/run` allows execution of arbitrary SQL queries without any
  access control. This vulnerability can be exploited by attackers to perform Arbitrary
  File Write, enabling them to write arbitrary files to the victim's file system.
  This can potentially lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) by writing malicious files
  such as `__init__.py` in the Python's `/site-packages/` directory."
