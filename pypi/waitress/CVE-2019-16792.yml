identifier: "CVE-2019-16792"
package_slug: "pypi/waitress"
title: "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests (HTTP Request Smuggling)"
description: "Waitress allows request smuggling by sending the Content-Length header
  twice. Waitress would header fold a double Content-Length header and due to being
  unable to cast the now comma separated value to an integer would set the Content-Length
  to 0 internally. If two `Content-Length` headers are sent in a single request, Waitress
  treats the body of the request as a new request in HTTP pipelining."
