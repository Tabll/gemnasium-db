identifier: "CVE-2020-5236"
package_slug: "pypi/waitress"
title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "Waitress version allows a DoS attack when waitress receives a header
  that contains invalid characters. When a header similar to `Bad-header: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\\x10`
  is received, it will cause the regular expression engine to catastrophically backtrack
  causing the process to use % CPU time and blocking any other interactions. This
  allows an attacker to send a single request with an invalid header and take the
  service offline."
