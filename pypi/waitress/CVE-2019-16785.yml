identifier: "CVE-2019-16785"
package_slug: "pypi/waitress"
title: "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests (HTTP Request Smuggling)"
description: "Waitress implemented an optional part of the RFC7230 which states: \"Although
  the line terminator for the start-line and header fields is the sequence CRLF, a
  recipient may recognize a single LF as a line terminator and ignore any preceding
  CR.\" Unfortunately if a front-end server does not parse header fields with an LF
  the same way as it does those with a CRLF it can lead to the front-end and the back-end
  server parsing the same HTTP message in two different ways. This can lead to a potential
  for HTTP request smuggling/splitting whereby Waitress may see two requests while
  the front-end server only sees a single HTTP message."
