identifier: "CVE-2019-16786"
package_slug: "pypi/waitress"
title: "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests (HTTP Request Smuggling)"
description: "Waitress would parse the Transfer-Encoding header and only look for
  a single string value, if that value was not chunked it would fall through and use
  the Content-Length header instead. According to the HTTP standard Transfer-Encoding
  should be a comma separated list, with the inner-most encoding first, followed by
  any further transfer codings, ending with chunked. Requests sent with: \"Transfer-Encoding:
  gzip, chunked\" would incorrectly get ignored, and the request would use a Content-Length
  header instead to determine the body size of the HTTP message. This could allow
  for Waitress to treat a single request as multiple requests in the case of HTTP
  pipelining."
