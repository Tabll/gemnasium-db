package_slug: "pypi/waitress"
title: "HTTP Request Smuggling: Invalid Transfer-Encoding in Waitress"
description: "Waitress would parse the `Transfer-Encoding` header and only look for
  a single string value, if that value was not `chunked` it would fall through and
  use the `Content-Length` header instead.\n\nAccording to the HTTP standard `Transfer-Encoding`
  should be a comma separated list, with the inner-most encoding first, followed by
  any further transfer codings, ending with `chunked`.\n\nRequests sent with:\n\n```\nTransfer-Encoding:
  gzip, chunked\n```\n\nWould incorrectly get ignored, and the request would use a
  `Content-Length` header instead to determine the body size of the HTTP message.\n\nThis
  could allow for Waitress to treat a single request as multiple requests in the case
  of HTTP pipelining."
