package_slug: "pypi/waitress"
title: "Waitress vulnerable to DoS leading to high CPU usage/resource exhaustion"
description: "When a remote client closes the connection before waitress has had the
  opportunity to call `getpeername()` waitress won't correctly clean up the connection
  leading to the main thread attempting to write to a socket that no longer exists,
  but not removing it from the list of sockets to attempt to process. This leads to
  a busy-loop calling the write function.\n\nA remote attacker could run waitress
  out of available sockets with very little resources required."
