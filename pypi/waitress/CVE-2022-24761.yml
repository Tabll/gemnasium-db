title: "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request Smuggling')"
description: "Waitress is a Web Server Gateway Interface server for Python 2 and 3.
  When using Waitress versions 2.1.0 and prior behind a proxy that does not properly
  validate the incoming HTTP request matches the RFC7230 standard, Waitress and the
  frontend proxy may disagree on where one request starts and where it ends. This
  would allow requests to be smuggled via the front-end proxy to waitress and later
  behavior. There are two classes of vulnerability that may lead to request smuggling
  that are addressed by this advisory: The use of Python's `int()` to parse strings
  into integers, leading to `+10` to be parsed as `10`, or `0x01` to be parsed as
  `1`, where as the standard specifies that the string should contain only digits
  or hex digits; and Waitress does not support chunk extensions, however it was discarding
  them without validating that they does not contain illegal characters. This vulnerability
  has been patched in Waitress 2.1.1. A workaround is available. When deploying a
  proxy in front of waitress, turning on any and all functionality to make sure that
  the request matches the RFC7230 standard. Certain proxy servers may not have this
  functionality though and users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version of
  waitress instead."
