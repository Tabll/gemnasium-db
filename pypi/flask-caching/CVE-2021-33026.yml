identifier: "CVE-2021-33026"
package_slug: "pypi/flask-caching"
title: "Improper Privilege Management"
description: "The Flask-Caching extension for Flask relies on Pickle for serialization,
  which may lead to remote code execution or local privilege escalation. If an attacker
  gains access to cache storage (e.g., filesystem, Memcached, Redis, etc.), they can
  construct a crafted payload, poison the cache, and execute Python code."
