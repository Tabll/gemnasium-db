title: "Withdrawn Advisory: Microsoft Knack ReDoS Vulnerability in the Introspection
  Module"
description: "### Withdrawn Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because the
  attack surface of this vulnerability is outside of Knack's intended functionality.
  The maintainer states the following:\n\n> These CVEs are invalid. Knack is a CLI
  framework used by [Azure CLI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli). It's a local
  library, not a web service. In addition, the regex is used to extract function and
  parameter docstrings from the source code. It is not used to match user input. Therefore,
  it does not expose any attack surface. There is no way to use it for ReDoS attack.\n\nThis
  link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n### Original Description\nMicrosoft
  Knack 0.12.0 allows Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in the knack.introspection
  module (issue 1 of 2)."
