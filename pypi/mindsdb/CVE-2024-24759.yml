title: "MindsDB Vulnerable to Bypass of SSRF Protection with DNS Rebinding"
description: "DNS rebinding is a method of manipulating resolution of domain names
  to let the initial DNS query hits an address and the second hits another one. For
  instance the host `make-190.119.176.200-rebind-127.0.0.1-rr.1u.ms`  would be initially
  resolved to `190.119.176.200` and the next DNS issue to `127.0.0.1`. Please notice
  the following in the latest codebase:\n\n```python\ndef is_private_url(url: str):\n\"\"\"\nRaises
  exception if url is private\n\n:param url: url to check\n\"\"\"\n\nhostname = urlparse(url).hostname\nif
