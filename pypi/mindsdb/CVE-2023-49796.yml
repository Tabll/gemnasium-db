package_slug: "pypi/mindsdb"
title: "Improper Input Validation in mindsdb"
description: "The put method in `mindsdb/mindsdb/api/http/namespaces/file.py` does
  not validate the user-controlled `name` value, which is used in a temporary file
  name, which is afterwards opened for writing on lines 122-125, which leads to path
  injection. This issue may lead to arbitrary file write. This vulnerability allows
  for writing files anywhere on the server that the filesystem permissions that the
  running server has access to."
