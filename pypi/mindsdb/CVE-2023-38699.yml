title: "Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data"
description: "MindsDB's AI Virtual Database allows developers to connect any AI/ML
  model to any datasource. Prior to version 23.7.4.0, a call to requests with `verify=False`
  disables SSL certificate checks. This rule enforces always verifying SSL certificates
  for methods in the Requests library. In version 23.7.4.0, certificates are validated
  by default, which is the desired behavior."
