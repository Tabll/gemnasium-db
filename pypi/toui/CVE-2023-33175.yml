package_slug: "pypi/toui"
title: "toui allows user-specific variables to be shared between users"
description: "### Impact\nWebsites that use `Website.user_vars` property in versions.\n\n###
  Patches\nIt affects versions v2.0.1 to v2.4.0. Please upgrade to v2.4.1\n\n### Workarounds\nDo
  not use `Website.user_vars` in websites when using versions v2.0.1 to v2.4.0. Also,
  do not use `Website.signin_user()` in version v2.4.0 only.\n\n### Explanation\nToUI
  is using Flask-Caching (SimpleCache) to store user variables. My misunderstanding
  was that these caches are stored in the client's browser, but it seems that these
  are stored in the server side.\n"
