title: "Relative Path Traversal"
description: "JupyterLab is an extensible environment for interactive and reproducible
  computing, based on the Jupyter Notebook and Architecture. Users of JupyterLab who
  click on a malicious link may get their `Authorization` and `XSRFToken` tokens exposed
  to a third party when running an older `jupyter-server` version. JupyterLab versions
  4.1.0b2, 4.0.11, and 3.6.7 are patched. No workaround has been identified, however
  users should ensure to upgrade `jupyter-server` to version 2.7.2 or newer which
  includes a redirect vulnerability fix."
