title: "JupyterLab LaTeX typesetter links did not enforce `noopener` attribute"
description: "Links generated with LaTeX typesetters in Markdown files and Markdown
  cells in JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebook did not include the `noopener` attribute.\n\nThis
  is deemed to have no impact on the default installations. Theoretically users of
  third-party LaTeX-rendering extensions could find themselves vulnerable to reverse
  tabnabbing attacks if:\n- links generated by those extensions included `target=_blank`
  (no such extensions are known at time of writing) and\n- they were to click on a
  link generated in LaTeX (typically visibly different from other links).\n\nFor consistency
  with handling on other links, new versions of JupyterLab will enforce `noopener`
  and `target=_blank` on all links generated by typesetters. The former will harden
  the resilience of JupyterLab to extensions with lack of secure defaults in link
  rendering, and the latter will improve user experience by preventing accidental
  state loss when clicking on links rendered by LaTeX typesetters."
