identifier: "CVE-2021-32797"
package_slug: "pypi/jupyterlab"
title: "Cross-site Scripting"
description: "JupyterLab is a user interface for Project Jupyter which will eventually
  replace the classic Jupyter Notebook. JupyterLab doesnâ€™t sanitize the action attribute
  of html `<form>`. Using this, it is possible to trigger the form validation outside
  of the form itself. This is a remote code execution, but requires user action to
  open a notebook."
