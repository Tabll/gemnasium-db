package_slug: "pypi/Flask-AppBuilder"
title: "Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort"
description: "Flask-AppBuilder is an application development framework built on top
  of Flask python framework. In versions prior to 4.1.3 an authenticated Admin user
  could query other users by their salted and hashed passwords strings. These filters
  could be made by using partial hashed password strings. The response would not include
  the hashed passwords, but an attacker could infer partial password hashes and their
  respective users. This issue has been fixed in version 4.1.3. Users are advised
  to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue."
