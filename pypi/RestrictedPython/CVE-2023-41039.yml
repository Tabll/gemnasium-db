package_slug: "pypi/RestrictedPython"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream
  Component ('Injection')"
description: "RestrictedPython is a restricted execution environment for Python to
  run untrusted code. Python's \"format\" functionality allows someone controlling
  the format string to \"read\" all objects accessible through recursive attribute
  lookup and subscription from objects he can access. This can lead to critical information
  disclosure. With `RestrictedPython`, the format functionality is available via the
  `format` and `format_map` methods of `str` (and `unicode`) (accessed either via
  the class or its instances) and via `string.Formatter`. All known versions of `RestrictedPython`
  is vulnerable. This issue has been addressed in commit `4134aedcff1` which has been
  included in the 5.4 and 6.2 releases. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no
  known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n\n"
