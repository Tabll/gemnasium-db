title: "Fake package, execution of benign malware"
description: "Copies of several well known Python packages were published under slightly
  modified names in the official Python package repository PyPI (prominent example
  includes urllib vs. urrlib3, bzip vs. bzip2, etc.). These packages contain the exact
  same code as their upstream package thus their functionality is the same, but the
  installation script, setup.py, is modified to include a malicious (but relatively
  benign) code."
