title: "Key Caching behavior in the DynamoDB Encryption Client."
description: "### Impact\nThis advisory concerns users of MostRecentProvider in the
  DynamoDB Encryption Client with a key provider like AWS Key Management Service that
  allows for permissions on keys to be modified.\n\nWhen key usage permissions were
  changed at the key provider, time-based key reauthorization logic in MostRecentProvider
  did not reauthorize the use of the key. This created the potential for keys to be
  used in the DynamoDB Encryption Client after permissions to do so were revoked at
  the key provider.\n\n### Patches\nFixed as of We recommend users to modify their
  code and adopt `CachingMostRecentProvider`.\n\n\n### Workarounds\nUsers who cannot
  upgrade to use the `CachingMostRecentProvider` can call `clear()` on the cache to
  manually flush all of its contents. Next use of the key will force a re-validation
  to occur with the key provider."
