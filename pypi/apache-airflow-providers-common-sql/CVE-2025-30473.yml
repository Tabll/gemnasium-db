title: "Apache Airflow Common SQL Provider Vulnerable to SQL Injection"
description: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL
  Injection') vulnerability in Apache Airflow Common SQL Provider.\n\nWhen using the
  partition clause in SQLTableCheckOperator as parameter (which was a recommended
  pattern), Authenticated UI User could inject arbitrary SQL command when triggering
  DAG exposing partition_clause to the user.\nThis allowed the DAG Triggering user
  to escalate privileges to execute those arbitrary commands which they normally would
  not have.\n\n\nThis issue affects Apache Airflow Common SQL Provider: before 1.24.1.\n\nUsers
  are recommended to upgrade to version 1.24.1, which fixes the issue."
