title: "Cipher.update_into can corrupt memory if passed an immutable python object
  as the outbuf"
description: "Previously, `Cipher.update_into` would accept Python objects which implement
  the buffer protocol, but provide only immutable buffers:\n\n```pycon\n>>> outbuf
  = b\"\\x00\" * 32\n>>> c = ciphers.Cipher(AES(b\"\\x00\" * 32), modes.ECB()).encryptor()\n>>>
  c.update_into(b\"\\x00\" * 16, outbuf)\n16\n>>> outbuf\nb'\\xdc\\x95\\xc0x\\xa2@\\x89\\x89\\xadH\\xa2\\x14\\x92\\x84
  \\x87\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00'\n```\n\nThis
  would allow immutable objects (such as `bytes`) to be mutated, thus violating fundamental
  rules of Python. This is a soundness bug -- it allows programmers to misuse an API,
  it cannot be exploited by attacker controlled data alone.\n\nThis now correctly
  raises an exception.\n\nThis issue has been present since `update_into` was originally
  introduced in cryptography 1.8."
