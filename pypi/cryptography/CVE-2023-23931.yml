package_slug: "pypi/cryptography"
title: "Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions"
description: "cryptography is a package designed to expose cryptographic primitives
  and recipes to Python developers. In affected versions `Cipher.update_into` would
  accept Python objects which implement the buffer protocol, but provide only immutable
  buffers. This would allow immutable objects (such as `bytes`) to be mutated, thus
  violating fundamental rules of Python and resulting in corrupted output. This now
  correctly raises an exception. This issue has been present since `update_into` was
  originally introduced in cryptography 1.8."
