title: "pyca/cryptography's wheels include vulnerable OpenSSL"
description: "pyca/cryptography's wheels include a statically linked copy of OpenSSL.
  The versions of OpenSSL included in cryptography 0.8-41.0.2 is vulnerable to several
  security issues. More details about the vulnerabilities themselves can be found
  in https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230731.txt, https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230719.txt,
  and https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230714.txt.\n\nIf you are building cryptography
  source (\"sdist\") then you are responsible for upgrading your copy of OpenSSL.
  Only users installing from wheels built by the cryptography project (i.e., those
  distributed on PyPI) need to update their cryptography versions."
