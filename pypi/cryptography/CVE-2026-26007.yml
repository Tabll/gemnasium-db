title: "cryptography Vulnerable to a Subgroup Attack Due to Missing Subgroup Validation
  for SECT Curves"
description: "The `public_key_from_numbers` (or `EllipticCurvePublicNumbers.public_key()`),
  `EllipticCurvePublicNumbers.public_key()`, `load_der_public_key()` and `load_pem_public_key()`
  functions do not verify that the point belongs to the expected prime-order subgroup
  of the curve.\n\nThis missing validation allows an attacker to provide a public
  key point `P` from a small-order subgroup.  This can lead to security issues in
  various situations, such as the most commonly used signature verification (ECDSA)
  and shared key negotiation (ECDH). When the victim computes the shared secret as
  `S = [victim_private_key]P` via ECDH,  this leaks information about `victim_private_key
  mod (small_subgroup_order)`. For curves with cofactor > 1, this reveals the least
  significant bits of the private key.  When these weak public keys are used in ECDSA
  , it's easy to forge signatures on the small subgroup.\n\nOnly SECT curves are impacted
  by this."
