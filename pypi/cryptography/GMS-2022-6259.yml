title: "Vulnerable OpenSSL included in cryptography wheels"
description: "pyca/cryptography's wheels include a statically linked copy of OpenSSL.
  The versions of OpenSSL included in cryptography 37.0.0-38.0.3 is vulnerable to
  a number of security issues. More details about the vulnerabilities themselves can
  be found in https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20221101.txt.\n\nIf you are building
  cryptography source (\"sdist\") then you are responsible for upgrading your copy
  of OpenSSL. Only users installing from wheels built by the cryptography project
  (i.e., those distributed on PyPI) need to update their cryptography versions."
