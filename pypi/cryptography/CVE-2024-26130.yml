title: "cryptography NULL pointer dereference with pkcs12.serialize_key_and_certificates
  when called with a non-matching certificate and private key and an hmac_hash override"
description: "If `pkcs12.serialize_key_and_certificates` is called with both:\n\n1.
  A certificate whose public key did not match the provided private key\n2. An `encryption_algorithm`
  with `hmac_hash` set (via `PrivateFormat.PKCS12.encryption_builder().hmac_hash(...)`\n\nThen
  a NULL pointer dereference would occur, crashing the Python process.\n\nThis has
  been resolved, and now a `ValueError` is properly raised.\n\nPatched in https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/pull/10423"
