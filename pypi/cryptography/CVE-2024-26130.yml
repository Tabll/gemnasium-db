title: "NULL Pointer Dereference"
description: "cryptography is a package designed to expose cryptographic primitives
  and recipes to Python developers. Starting in version 38.0.0 and prior to version
  42.0.4, if `pkcs12.serialize_key_and_certificates` is called with both a certificate
  whose public key does not match the provided private key and an `encryption_algorithm`
  with `hmac_hash` set (via `PrivateFormat.PKCS12.encryption_builder().hmac_hash(...)`,
  then a NULL pointer dereference would occur, crashing the Python process. This has
  been resolved in version 42.0.4, the first version in which a `ValueError` is properly
  raised."
