package_slug: "pypi/ipython"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command
  Injection')"
description: "IPython (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing
  in multiple programming languages, originally developed for the Python programming
  language. Versions prior to 8.1.0 are subject to a command injection vulnerability
  with very specific prerequisites. This vulnerability requires that the function
  `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` be called on Windows in a Python environment
  where ctypes is not available. The dependency on `ctypes` in `IPython.utils._process_win32`
  prevents the vulnerable code from ever being reached in the ipython binary. However,
  as a library that could be used by another tool `set_term_title` could be called
  and hence introduce a vulnerability. Should an attacker get untrusted input to an
  instance of this function they would be able to inject shell commands as current
  process and limited to the scope of the current process. Users of ipython as a library
  are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that any calls to
  the `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` function are done with trusted or filtered
  input."
