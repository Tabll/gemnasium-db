package_slug: "pypi/matrix-sydent"
title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "Sydent is a reference Matrix identity server. Sydent does not limit
  the size of requests it receives from HTTP clients. A malicious user could send
  an HTTP request with a very large body, leading to memory exhaustion and denial
  of service. Sydent also does not limit response size for requests it makes to remote
  Matrix homeservers. A malicious homeserver could return a very large response, again
  leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service. This affects any server which
  accepts registration requests from untrusted clients. This issue has been patched
  by releases a1, f56eee3. As a workaround request sizes can be limited in an HTTP
  reverse-proxy. There are no known workarounds for the problem with overlarge responses."
