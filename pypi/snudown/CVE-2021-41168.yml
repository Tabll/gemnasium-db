package_slug: "pypi/snudown"
title: "Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm"
description: "References written in markdown are inserted into a hash table which
  was found to have a weak hash function, meaning that an attacker can reliably generate
  a large number of collisions for it. This makes the hash table vulnerable to a hash-collision
  DoS attack, a type of algorithmic complexity attack. Further the hash table allowed
  for duplicate entries resulting in long retrieval times."
