package_slug: "pypi/OpenEXR"
title: "OpenEXR Out-Of-Memory via Unbounded File Header Values"
description: "The OpenEXR file format defines many information about the final image
  inside of the file header, such as the size of data/display window.\n\nThe application
  trusts the value of `dataWindow` size provided in the header of the input file,
  and performs computations based on this value.\n\nThis may result in unintended
  behaviors, such as excessively large number of iterations and/or huge memory allocations."
