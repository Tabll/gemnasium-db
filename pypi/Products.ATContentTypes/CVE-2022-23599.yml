package_slug: "pypi/Products.ATContentTypes"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "`Products.ATContentTypes` are the core content types for Plone that are dependent 
  on `Products.ATContentTypes` which is vulnerable to reflected cross site scripting and open 
  redirect when an attacker can get a compromised version of the `image_view_fullscreen` page 
  in a cache, for example in Varnish. The technique is known as cache poisoning. Any later 
  visitor can get redirected when clicking on a link on this page. Usually only anonymous users 
  are affected, but this depends on the user's cache settings of `Products.ATContentTypes`. 
  As a workaround, make sure the `image_view_fullscreen` page is not stored in the cache."
