package_slug: "pypi/Products.ATContentTypes"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "`Products.ATContentTypes` are the core content types for Plone that
  are dependent on `Products.ATContentTypes` which is vulnerable to reflected cross
  site scripting and open redirect when an attacker can get a compromised version
  of the `image_view_fullscreen` page in a cache, for example in Varnish. The technique
  is known as cache poisoning. Any later visitor can get redirected when clicking
  on a link on this page. Usually only anonymous users are affected, but this depends
  on the user's cache settings of `Products.ATContentTypes`. As a workaround, make
  sure the `image_view_fullscreen` page is not stored in the cache."
