title: "Remote code execution"
description: "An integer overflow can occur when processing any variant of a \"literal
  run\". When certain payloads are processed, a pointer to an output buffer can be
  set to an address outside the output buffer. Since the attacker can specify exact
  offsets in memory, it is very easy to create a reliable Remote Code Execution exploit."
