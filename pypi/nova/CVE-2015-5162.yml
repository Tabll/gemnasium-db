title: "OpenStack Cinder, Glance, and Nova contain Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "A resource vulnerability in the OpenStack Compute (nova), Block Storage
  (cinder), and Image (glance) services was found in their use of qemu-img. An unprivileged
  user could consume as much as 4 GB of RAM on the compute host by uploading a malicious
  image. This flaw could lead possibly to host out-of-memory errors and negatively
  affect other running tenant instances. oslo.concurrency has been updated to support
  process limits ('prlimit'), which is needed to fix this flaw."
