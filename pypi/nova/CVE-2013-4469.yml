title: "OpenStack Compute (Nova) Denial of service due to improper validation of virtual
  size of QCOW2 image"
description: "OpenStack Compute (Nova) Folsom, Grizzly, and Havana, when use_cow_images
  is set to False, does not verify the virtual size of a QCOW2 image, which allows
  local users to cause a denial of service (host file system disk consumption) by
  transferring an image with a large virtual size that does not contain a large amount
  of data from Glance.  NOTE: this issue is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-2096."
