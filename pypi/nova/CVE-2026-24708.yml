title: "OpenStack Nova calls qemu-img without format restrictions for resize "
description: "An issue was discovered in OpenStack Nova before 30.2.2, 31 before 31.2.1,
  and 32 before 32.1.1. By writing a malicious QCOW header to a root or ephemeral
  disk and then triggering a resize, a user may convince Nova's Flat image backend
  to call qemu-img without a format restriction, resulting in an unsafe image resize
  operation that could destroy data on the host system. Only compute nodes using the
  Flat image backend (usually configured with use_cow_images=False) are affected."
