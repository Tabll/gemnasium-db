title: "OpenStack Cinder, Glance, and Nova vulnerable to arbitrary file access"
description: "An issue was discovered in OpenStack Cinder through 24.0.0, Glance before
  28.0.2, and Nova before 29.0.3. Arbitrary file access can occur via custom QCOW2
  external data. By supplying a crafted QCOW2 image that references a specific data
  file path, an authenticated user may convince systems to return a copy of that file's
  contents from the server, resulting in unauthorized access to potentially sensitive
  data. All Cinder and Nova deployments are affected; only Glance deployments with
  image conversion enabled are affected."
