title: "OpenStack Nova Denial of service attack on the compute host"
description: "An issue was discovered in OpenStack Nova 15.x through 15.1.0 and 16.x
  through 16.1.1. By detaching and reattaching an encrypted volume, an attacker may
  access the underlying raw volume and corrupt the LUKS header, resulting in a denial
  of service attack on the compute host. (The same code error also results in data
  loss, but that is not a vulnerability because the user loses their own data.) All
  Nova setups supporting encrypted volumes are affected."
