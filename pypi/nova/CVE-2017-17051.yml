title: "OpenStack Nova DoS by rebuilding the same instance with a new image multiple
  times"
description: "An issue was discovered in the default FilterScheduler in OpenStack
  Nova 16.0.3. By repeatedly rebuilding an instance with new images, an authenticated
  user may consume untracked resources on a hypervisor host leading to a denial of
  service, aka doubled resource allocations. This regression was introduced with the
  fix for OSSA-2017-005 (CVE-2017-16239); however, only Nova stable/pike or later
  deployments with that fix applied and relying on the default FilterScheduler are
  affected."
