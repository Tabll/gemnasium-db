title: "OpenStack Nova Filter Scheduler Bypass"
description: "In OpenStack Nova through 14.0.9, 15.x through 15.0.7, and 16.x through
  16.0.2, by rebuilding an instance, an authenticated user may be able to circumvent
  the Filter Scheduler bypassing imposed filters (for example, the ImagePropertiesFilter
  or the IsolatedHostsFilter). All setups using Nova Filter Scheduler are affected.
  Because of the regression described in Launchpad Bug #1732947, the preferred fix
  is a 14.x version after 14.0.10, a 15.x version after 15.0.8, or a 16.x version
  after 16.0.3."
