title: "OpenStack Nova vulnerable to unauthorized access to potentially sensitive
  data "
description: "In OpenStack Nova before 27.4.1, 28 before 28.2.1, and 29 before 29.1.1,
  by supplying a raw format image that is actually a crafted QCOW2 image with a backing
  file path or VMDK flat image with a descriptor file path, an authenticated user
  may convince systems to return a copy of the referenced file's contents from the
  server, resulting in unauthorized access to potentially sensitive data. All Nova
  deployments are affected. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for
  CVE-2022-47951 and CVE-2024-32498."
