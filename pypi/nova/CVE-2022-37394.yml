title: "OpenStack Nova Changing vnic_type breaks compute service restart"
description: "An issue was discovered in OpenStack Nova before 23.2.2, 24.x before
  24.1.2, and 25.x before 25.0.2. By creating a neutron port with the direct vnic_type,
  creating an instance bound to that port, and then changing the vnic_type of the
  bound port to macvtap, an authenticated user may cause the compute service to fail
  to restart, resulting in a possible denial of service. Only Nova deployments configured
  with SR-IOV are affected."
