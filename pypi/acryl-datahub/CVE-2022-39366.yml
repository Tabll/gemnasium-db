package_slug: "pypi/acryl-datahub"
title: "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature"
description: "DataHub is an open-source metadata platform. Prior to version 0.8.45,
  the `StatelessTokenService` of the DataHub metadata service (GMS) does not verify
  the signature of JWT tokens. This allows an attacker to connect to DataHub instances
  as any user if Metadata Service authentication is enabled. This vulnerability occurs
  because the `StatelessTokenService` of the Metadata service uses the `parse` method
  of `io.jsonwebtoken.JwtParser`, which does not perform a verification of the cryptographic
  token signature. This means that JWTs are accepted regardless of the used algorithm.
  This issue may lead to an authentication bypass. Version 0.8.45 contains a patch
  for the issue. There are no known workarounds."
