title: "ReDoS in LDAP schema parser"
description: "https://github.com/python-ldap/python-ldap/issues/424\n\n### Impact\nThe
  LDAP schema parser of python-ldap are vulnerable to a regular expression denial-of-service
  attack. The issue affects clients that use ``ldap.schema`` package to parse LDAP
  schema definitions from an untrusted source.\n\n### Patches\nThe upcoming release
  of python-ldap will contain a workaround to prevent ReDoS attacks. The schema parser
  refuses schema definitions with an excessive amount of backslashes.\n\n### Workarounds\nAs
  a workaround, users can check input for excessive amount of backslashes in schemas.
  More than a dozen backslashes per line are atypical.\n\n### References\n[CWE-1333](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html)\n\n###
