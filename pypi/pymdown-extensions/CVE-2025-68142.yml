package_slug: "pypi/pymdown-extensions"
title: "PyMdown Extensions has a ReDOS bug in its Figure Capture extension"
description: "The original issue came through PyMdown Extensions' normal issue tracker
  instead of the typical security flow: https://github.com/facelessuser/pymdown-extensions/issues/2716.
  Because this came through the normal issue flow, it was handled as a normal issue.
  In the future, PyMdown Extensions will ensure such issues, even if prematurely made
  public through the normal issue flow, are redirected through the typical security
  process.\n\nThe regular expression pattern in question is as follows:\n\n```py\nRE_FIG_NUM
  = re.compile(r'^(\\^)?([1-9][0-9]*(?:.[1-9][0-9]*)*)(?= |$)')\n```\n\nThe POC was
  provided by @ShangzhiXu\n\n```py\nimport re\nimport time\n\nregex_pattern = re.compile(r'^(\\^)?([1-9][0-9]*(?:.[1-9][0-9]*)*)(?=
  |$)')\n\nfor i in range(50, 500, 50):\nlong_string = '1' * i + 'a'\nstart_time =
  time.time()\nmatch = re.match(regex_pattern, long_string)\nend_time = time.time()\nprint(f\"long_string
  execution time: {end_time - start_time:.6f} s\")\n```\n\nThe issue with the above
  pattern is that `.` was used, which accepts any character when we meant to use `\\.`.
  The fix was to update the pattern to:\n\n```py\nRE_FIG_NUM = re.compile(r'^(\\^)?([1-9][0-9]*(?:\\.[1-9][0-9]*)*)(?=
  |$)')\n```\n\nRelevant PR with fix: https://github.com/facelessuser/pymdown-extensions/pull/2717"
