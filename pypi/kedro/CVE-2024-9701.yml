title: "Kedro deserialization vulnerability"
description: "A Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability has been identified in the
  Kedro ShelveStore class (version 0.19.8). This vulnerability allows an attacker
  to execute arbitrary Python code via deserialization of malicious payloads, potentially
  leading to a full system compromise. The ShelveStore class uses Python's shelve
  module to manage session data, which relies on pickle for serialization. Crafting
  a malicious payload and storing it in the shelve file can lead to RCE when the payload
  is deserialized."
