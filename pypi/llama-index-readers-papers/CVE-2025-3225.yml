title: "LlamaIndex has an XML Entity Expansion vulnerability in its sitemap parser"
description: "An XML Entity Expansion vulnerability, also known as a 'billion laughs'
  attack, exists in the sitemap parser of the run-llama/llama_index repository, specifically
  affecting the Papers Loaders package before version 0.3.2 (in llama-index v0.10.0
  and above through v0.12.29). This vulnerability allows an attacker to supply a malicious
  Sitemap XML, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) by exhausting system memory and
  potentially causing a system crash. The issue is resolved in version 0.3.2 (in llama-index
  0.12.29)."
