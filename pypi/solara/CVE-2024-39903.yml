title: "Local File Inclusion in Solara"
description: "A Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability was identified in widgetti/solara,
  in version <1.35.1, which was fixed in version 1.35.1. This vulnerability arises
  from the application's failure to properly validate URI fragments for directory
  traversal sequences such as '../' when serving static files. An attacker can exploit
  this flaw by manipulating the fragment part of the URI to read arbitrary files on
  the local file system."
