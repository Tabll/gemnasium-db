title: "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature"
description: "PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard.
  PySAML2 has an improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability. All
  users of pysaml2 that need to validate signed SAML documents are impacted. The vulnerability
  is a variant of XML Signature wrapping because it did not validate the SAML document
  against an XML schema. This allowed invalid XML documents to be processed and such
  a document can trick pysaml2 with a wrapped signature. This is fixed in PySAML2 "
