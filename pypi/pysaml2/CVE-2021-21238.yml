package_slug: "pypi/pysaml2"
title: "SAML XML Signature wrapping in PySAML2"
description: "All users of pysaml2 that use the default `CryptoBackendXmlSec1` backend
  and need to verify signed SAML documents are impacted. `pysaml2 <= 6.4.1` does not
  validate the SAML document against an XML schema. This allows invalid XML documents
  to trick the verification process, by presenting elements with a valid signature
  inside elements whose content has been malformed. The verification is offloaded
  to `xmlsec1` and `xmlsec1` will not validate every signature in the given document,
  but only the first it finds in the given scope."
