package_slug: "pypi/pysaml2"
title: "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature in PySAML2"
description: "PySAML2 before 5.0.0 does not check that the signature in a SAML document
  is enveloped and thus signature wrapping is effective, i.e., it is affected by XML
  Signature Wrapping (XSW). The signature information and the node/object that is
  signed can be in different places and thus the signature verification will succeed,
  but the wrong data will be used. This specifically affects the verification of assertions
  that have been signed."
