package_slug: "pypi/pysaml2"
title: "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature"
description: "PySAML2 does not check that the signature in a SAML document is enveloped
  and thus signature wrapping is effective, i. The signature information and the node/object
  that is signed can be in different places and thus the signature verification will
  succeed, but the wrong data will be used. This specifically affects the verification
  of assertion that have been signed."
