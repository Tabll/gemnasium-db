package_slug: "pypi/pysaml2"
title: "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature"
description: "PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard.
  PySAML2 has an improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability. Users
  of pysaml2 that use the default `CryptoBackendXmlSec1` backend and need to verify
  signed SAML documents are impacted. PySAML2 does not ensure that a signed SAML document
  is correctly signed. The default `CryptoBackendXmlSec1` backend is using the `xmlsec1`
  binary to verify the signature of signed SAML documents, but by default `xmlsec1`
  accepts any type of key found within the given document. `xmlsec1` needs to be configured
  explicitly to only use only _x509 certificates_ for the verification process of
  the SAML document signature. This is fixed in PySAML2 "
