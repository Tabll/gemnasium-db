title: "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature in PySAML2"
description: "All users of pysaml2 that use the default `CryptoBackendXmlSec1` backend
  and need to verify signed SAML documents are impacted. `pysaml2 <= 6.4.1` does not
  ensure that a signed SAML document is correctly signed. The default `CryptoBackendXmlSec1`
  backend is using the `xmlsec1` binary to verify the signature of signed SAML documents,
  but by default, `xmlsec1` accepts any type of key found within the given document.
  `xmlsec1` needs to be configured explicitly to only use only _x509 certificates_
  for the verification process of the SAML document signature."
