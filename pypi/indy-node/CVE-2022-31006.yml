package_slug: "pypi/indy-node"
title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "indy-node is the server portion of Hyperledger Indy, a distributed ledger
  purpose-built for decentralized identity. In vulnerable versions of indy-node, an
  attacker can max out the number of client connections allowed by the ledger, leaving
  the ledger unable to be used for its intended purpose. However, the ledger content
  will not be impacted and the ledger will resume functioning after the attack. This
  attack exploits the trade-off between resilience and availability. Any protection
  against abusive client connections will also prevent the network being accessed
  by certain legitimate users. As a result, validator nodes must tune their firewall
  rules to ensure the right trade-off for their network's expected users. The guidance
  to network operators for the use of firewall rules in the deployment of Indy networks
  has been modified to better protect against denial of service attacks by increasing
  the cost and complexity in mounting such attacks. The mitigation for this vulnerability
  is not in the Hyperledger Indy code per se, but rather in the individual deployments
  of Indy. The mitigations should be applied to all deployments of Indy, and are not
  related to a particular release."
