title: "Duplicate Advisory: Remote code execution in dask"
description: "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-hwqr-f3v9-hwxr. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n## Original Description\nAn issue was discovered in Dask (aka python-dask)
  through 2021.09.1. Single machine Dask clusters started with dask.distributed.LocalCluster
  or dask.distributed.Client (which defaults to using LocalCluster) would mistakenly
  configure their respective Dask workers to listen on external interfaces (typically
  with a randomly selected high port) rather than only on localhost. A Dask cluster
  created using this method (when running on a machine that has an applicable port
  exposed) could be used by a sophisticated attacker to achieve remote code execution."
