package_slug: "pypi/dask"
title: "Remote code execution in dask"
description: "An issue was discovered in Dask (aka python-dask) through 2021.09.1.
  Single machine Dask clusters started with dask.distributed.LocalCluster or dask.distributed.Client
  (which defaults to using LocalCluster) would mistakenly configure their respective
  Dask workers to listen on external interfaces (typically with a randomly selected
  high port) rather than only on localhost. A Dask cluster created using this method
  (when running on a machine that has an applicable port exposed) could be used by
  a sophisticated attacker to achieve remote code execution."
