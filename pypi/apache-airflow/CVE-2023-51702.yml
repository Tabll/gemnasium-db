package_slug: "pypi/apache-airflow"
title: "Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File"
description: "Since version 5.2.0, when using deferrable mode with the path of a Kubernetes
  configuration file for authentication, the Airflow worker serializes this configuration
  file as a dictionary and sends it to the triggerer by storing it in metadata without
  any encryption. Additionally, if used with an Airflow version between 2.3.0 and
  2.6.0, the configuration dictionary will be logged as plain text in the triggerer
  service without masking. This allows anyone with access to the metadata or triggerer
  log to obtain the configuration file and use it to access the Kubernetes cluster.\n\nThis
  behavior was changed in version 7.0.0, which stopped serializing the file contents
  and started providing the file path instead to read the contents into the trigger.
  Users are recommended to upgrade to version 7.0.0, which fixes this issue."
