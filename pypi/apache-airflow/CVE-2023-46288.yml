title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability
  in Apache Airflow.This issue affects Apache Airflow from 2.4.0 to 2.7.0.\n\nSensitive
  configuration information has been exposed to authenticated users with the ability
  to read configuration via Airflow REST API for configuration even when the expose_config option
  is set to non-sensitive-only. The expose_config option is False by default. It is
  recommended to upgrade to a version that is not affected if you set expose_config to
  non-sensitive-only configuration. This is a different error than CVE-2023-45348 which
  allows authenticated user to retrieve individual configuration values in 2.7.* by
  specially crafting their request (solved in 2.7.2).\n\nUsers are recommended to
  upgrade to version 2.7.2, which fixes the issue and additionally fixes CVE-2023-45348.\n\n"
