title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "Apache Airflow, versions 2.6.0 through 2.7.3 has a stored XSS vulnerability
  that allows a DAG author to add an unbounded and not-sanitized javascript in the
  parameter description field of the DAG.Â This Javascript can be executed on the client
  side of any of the user who looks at the tasks in the browser sandbox. While this
  issue does not allow to exit the browser sandbox or manipulation of the server-side
  data - more than the DAG author already has, it allows to modify what the user looking
  at the DAG details sees in the browser - which opens up all kinds of possibilities
  of misleading other users.\n\nUsers of Apache Airflow are recommended to upgrade
  to version 2.8.0 or newer to mitigate the risk associated with this vulnerability\n"
