title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "In Apache Airflow, some potentially sensitive values were being shown
  to the user in certain situations.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact
  configuration is not shown in the UI by default (only if `[webserver] expose_config`
  is set to `non-sensitive-only`), and not all uncensored values are actually sentitive.\n\n\nThis
  issue affects Apache Airflow: from 2.5.0 before 2.6.2. Users are recommended to
  update to version 2.6.2 or later.\n\n\n"
