title: "Improper Certificate Validation"
description: "Apache Airflow SMTP Provider before 1.3.0, Apache Airflow IMAP Provider
  before 3.3.0, and Apache Airflow before 2.7.0 are affected by the Validation of
  OpenSSL Certificate vulnerability.\n\nThe default SSL context with SSL library does
  not check a server's X.509 certificate.  Instead, the code accepted any certificate,
  which could result in the disclosure of mail server credentials or mail contents when
  the client connects to an attacker in a MITM position.\n\nUsers are strongly advised
  to upgrade to Apache Airflow version 2.7.0 or newer, Apache Airflow IMAP Provider
  version 3.3.0 or newer, and Apache Airflow SMTP Provider version 1.3.0 or newer
  to mitigate the risk associated with this vulnerability"
