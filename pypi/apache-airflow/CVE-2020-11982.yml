title: "Insecure default config of Celery worker in Apache Airflow"
description: "An issue was found in Apache Airflow versions 1.10.10 and below. When
  using CeleryExecutor, if an attack can connect to the broker (Redis, RabbitMQ) directly,
  it was possible to insert a malicious payload directly to the broker which could
  lead to a deserialization attack (and thus remote code execution) on the Worker."
