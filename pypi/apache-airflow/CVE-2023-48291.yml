title: "Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere"
description: "Apache Airflow, in versions prior to 2.8.0, contains a security vulnerability
  that allows an authenticated user with limited access to some DAGs, to craft a request
  that could give the user write access to various DAG resources for DAGs that the
  user had no access to, thus, enabling the user to clear DAGs they shouldn't.\n\nThis
  is a missing fix for CVE-2023-42792 in Apache Airflow 2.7.2Â \n\nUsers of Apache
  Airflow are strongly advised to upgrade to version 2.8.0 or newer to mitigate the
