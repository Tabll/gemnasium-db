package_slug: "pypi/apache-airflow"
title: "Apache Airflow secrets in rendered templates could contain parts of sensitive
  values when truncated"
description: "In Apache Airflow versions before 3.1.6, when rendered template fields
  in a Dag exceed [core] max_templated_field_length, sensitive values could be exposed
  in cleartext in the Rendered Templates UI. This occurred because serialization of
  those fields used a secrets masker instance that did not include user-registered
  mask_secret() patterns, so secrets were not reliably masked before truncation and
  display.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to 3.1.6 or later, which fixes this
  issue"
