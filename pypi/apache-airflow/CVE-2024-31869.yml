title: "Apache Airflow: Sensitive configuration for providers displayed when \"non-sensitive-only\"
  config used"
description: "Airflow versions 2.7.0 through 2.8.4 have a vulnerability that allows
  an authenticated user to see sensitive provider configuration via the \"configuration\"
  UI pageÂ when \"non-sensitive-only\" was set as \"webserver.expose_config\" configuration
  (The celery provider is the only community provider currently that has sensitive
  configurations). You should migrate to Airflow 2.9 or change your \"expose_config\"
  configuration to False as a workaround. This is similar, but different to  CVE-2023-46288
  https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9qqg-mh7c-chfq  which concerned API, not UI configuration
  page."
