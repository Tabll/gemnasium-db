title: "Apache Airflow denial of service vulnerability"
description: "Apache Airflow, in versions prior to 2.7.0, contains a security vulnerability
  that can be exploited by an authenticated user possessing Connection edit privileges.
  This vulnerability allows the user to access connection information and exploit
  the test connection feature by sending many requests, leading to a denial of service
  (DoS) condition on the server. Furthermore, malicious actors can leverage this vulnerability
  to establish harmful connections with the server.\n\nUsers of Apache Airflow are
  strongly advised to upgrade to version 2.7.0 or newer to mitigate the risk associated
  with this vulnerability. Additionally, administrators are encouraged to review and
  adjust user permissions to restrict access to sensitive functionalities, reducing
  the attack surface."
