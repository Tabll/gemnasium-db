package_slug: "pypi/apache-airflow"
title: "Apache Airflow vulnerable to Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent
  Data"
description: "Airflow versions before 2.10.3 have a vulnerability that allows authenticated
  users with audit log access to see sensitive values in audit logs which they should
  not see.Â When sensitive variables were set via airflow CLI, values of those variables
  appeared in the audit log and were stored unencrypted in the Airflow database. While
  this risk is limited to users with audit log access, it is recommended to upgrade
  to Airflow 2.10.3 or a later version, which addresses this issue. Users who previously
  used the CLI to set secret variables should manually delete entries with those variables
  from the log table."
