title: "Session Fixation"
description: "The session fixation vulnerability allowed the authenticated user to
  continue accessing Airflow webserver even after the password of the user has been
  reset by the admin - up until the expiry of the session of the user. Other than
  manually cleaning the session database (for database session backend), or changing
  the secure_key and restarting the webserver, there were no mechanisms to force-logout
  the user (and all other users with that).\n\nWith this fix implemented, when using
  the database session backend, the existing sessions of the user are invalidated
  when the password of the user is reset. When using the securecookie session backend,
  the sessions are NOT invalidated and still require changing the secure key and restarting
  the webserver (and logging out all other users), but the user resetting the password
  is informed about it with a flash message warning displayed in the UI. Documentation
  is also updated explaining this behaviour.\n\nUsers of Apache Airflow are advised
  to upgrade to version 2.7.0 or newer to mitigate the risk associated with this vulnerability.\n"
