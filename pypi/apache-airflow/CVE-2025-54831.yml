title: "Apache Airflow: Connection sensitive details exposed to users with READ permissions"
description: "Apache Airflow 3 introduced a change to the handling of sensitive information
  in Connections. The intent was to restrict access to sensitive connection fields
  to Connection Editing Users, effectively applying a \"write-only\" model for sensitive
  values.\n\nIn Airflow 3.0.3, this model was unintentionally violated: sensitive
  connection information could be viewed by users with READ permissions through both
  the API and the UI. This behavior also bypassed the `AIRFLOW__CORE__HIDE_SENSITIVE_VAR_CONN_FIELDS`
  configuration option.\n\nThis issue does not affect Airflow 2.x, where exposing
  sensitive information to connection editors was the intended and documented behavior.\n\nUsers
  of Airflow 3.0.3 are advised to upgrade Airflow to >=3.0.4."
