title: "Apache Airflow proxy credentials for various providers might leak in task
  logs"
description: "In Apache Airflow versions before 3.1.6, the proxies and proxy fields
  within a Connection may include proxy URLs containing embedded authentication information.
  These fields were not treated as sensitive by default and therefore were not automatically
  masked in log output. As a result, when such connections are rendered or printed
  to logs, proxy credentials embedded in these fields could be exposed.\n\nUsers are
  recommended to upgrade to 3.1.6 or later, which fixes this issue"
