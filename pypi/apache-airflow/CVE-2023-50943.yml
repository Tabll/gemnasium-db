title: "Apache Airflow: pickle deserialization vulnerability in XComs"
description: "Apache Airflow, versions before 2.8.1, have a vulnerability that allows
  a potential attacker to poison the XCom data by bypassing the protection of \"enable_xcom_pickling=False\"
  configuration setting resulting in poisoned data after XCom deserialization. This
  vulnerability is considered low since it requires a DAG author to exploit it. Users
  are recommended to upgrade to version 2.8.1 or later, which fixes this issue."
