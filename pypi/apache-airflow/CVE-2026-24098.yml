title: "Apache Airflow UI Exposes DAG Import Errors to Unauthorized Authenticated
  Users"
description: "**Exposure of Sensitive Information:**\n\nAn information disclosure
  vulnerability exists in the Apache Airflow UI that allows authenticated users to
  view `Import Errors` for DAGs they are not authorized to access.\n\nIn affected
  versions, the **Import Errors** view does not correctly filter errors based on granular
  DAG permissions. This means a user with access to only `DAG_A` can view import errors
  generated by `DAG_B`, `DAG_C`, or system-level DAGs. These error logs often contain
  file paths, code snippets, or stack traces that reveal the internal structure and
  logic of restricted DAGs."
