title: "Remote code execution (RCE) in Apache Airflow"
description: "An issue was found in Apache Airflow versions 1.10.10 and below. A remote
  code/command injection vulnerability was discovered in one of the example DAGs shipped
  with Airflow which would allow any authenticated user to run arbitrary commands
  as the user running airflow worker/scheduler (depending on the executor in use).
  If you already have examples disabled by setting `load_examples=False` in the config
  then you are not vulnerable."
