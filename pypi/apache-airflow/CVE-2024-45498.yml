  version 2.10.0 has a vulnerability that allows an authenticated attacker with only
  DAG trigger permission to execute arbitrary commands. If you used that example as
  the base of your DAGs - please review if you have not copied the dangerous example;
  see  https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/41873 Â for more information. We recommend
