description: "Apache Airflow, version 2.7.0 through 2.7.3, has a vulnerability that
  allows an attacker to trigger a DAG in a GET request without CSRF validation.Â As
  a result, it was possible for a malicious website opened in the same browser - by
  the user who also had Airflow UI opened - to trigger the execution of DAGs without
  the user's consent.\nUsers are advised to upgrade to version 2.8.0 or later which
  is not affected"
