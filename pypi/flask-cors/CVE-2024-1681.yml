title: "flask-cors vulnerable to log injection when the log level is set to debug"
description: "corydolphin/flask-cors is vulnerable to log injection when the log level
  is set to debug. An attacker can inject fake log entries into the log file by sending
  a specially crafted GET request containing a CRLF sequence in the request path.
  This vulnerability allows attackers to corrupt log files, potentially covering tracks
  of other attacks, confusing log post-processing tools, and forging log entries.
  The issue is due to improper output neutralization for logs."
