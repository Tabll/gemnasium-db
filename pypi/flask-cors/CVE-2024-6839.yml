package_slug: "pypi/flask-cors"
title: "Flask-CORS improper regex path matching vulnerability"
description: "corydolphin/flask-cors version 4.0.1 contains an improper regex path
  matching vulnerability. The plugin prioritizes longer regex patterns over more specific
  ones when matching paths, which can lead to less restrictive CORS policies being
  applied to sensitive endpoints. This mismatch in regex pattern priority allows unauthorized
  cross-origin access to sensitive data or functionality, potentially exposing confidential
  information and increasing the risk of unauthorized actions by malicious actors."
