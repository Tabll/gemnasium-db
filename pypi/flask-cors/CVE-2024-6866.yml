title: "Flask-CORS vulnerable to Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity"
description: "corydolphin/flask-cors version 4.0.1 contains a vulnerability where
  the request path matching is case-insensitive due to the use of the `try_match`
  function, which is originally intended for matching hosts. This results in a mismatch
  because paths in URLs are case-sensitive, but the regex matching treats them as
  case-insensitive. This misconfiguration can lead to significant security vulnerabilities,
  allowing unauthorized origins to access paths meant to be restricted, resulting
  in data exposure and potential data leaks."
