title: "Flask-CORS allows for inconsistent CORS matching"
description: "A vulnerability in corydolphin/flask-cors version 4.0.1 allows for inconsistent
  CORS matching due to the handling of the '+' character in URL paths. The request.path
  is passed through the unquote_plus function, which converts the '+' character to
  a space ' '. This behavior leads to incorrect path normalization, causing potential
  mismatches in CORS configuration. As a result, endpoints may not be matched correctly
  to their CORS settings, leading to unexpected CORS policy application. This can
  cause unauthorized cross-origin access or block valid requests, creating security
  vulnerabilities and usability issues."
