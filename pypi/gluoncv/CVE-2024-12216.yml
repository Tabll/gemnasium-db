title: "GluonCV Arbitrary File Write via TarSlip"
description: "A vulnerability in the `ImageClassificationDataset.from_csv()` API of
  the `dmlc/gluon-cv` repository, version 0.10.0, allows for arbitrary file write.
  The function downloads and extracts `tar.gz` files from URLs without proper sanitization,
  making it susceptible to a TarSlip vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this by
  crafting malicious tar files that, when extracted, can overwrite files on the victim's
  system via path traversal or faked symlinks."
