title: "Exiv2 has quadratic performance in ICC profile parsing in JpegBase::readMetadata"
description: "A denial-of-service was found in Exiv2 version v0.28.5: a quadratic
  algorithm in the ICC profile parsing code in `jpegBase::readMetadata()` can cause
  Exiv2 to run for a long time. Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for
  reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. The denial-of-service
  is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a crafted jpg image file."
