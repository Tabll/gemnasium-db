package_slug: "pypi/exiv2"
title: "Exiv2 Segmentation Faults in Exiv2::EpsImage::writeMetadata() via crafted
  EPS file"
description: "An out-of-bounds read was found in Exiv2 versions v0.28.5 and earlier.
  Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting,
  and modifying the metadata of image files. The out-of-bounds read is triggered when
  Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially
  exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service by crashing Exiv2, if they
  can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file.\n\nNote that this
  bug is only triggered when writing the metadata, which is a less frequently used
  Exiv2 operation than reading the metadata. For example, to trigger the bug in the
  Exiv2 command-line application, you need to add an extra command-line argument such
  as delete."
