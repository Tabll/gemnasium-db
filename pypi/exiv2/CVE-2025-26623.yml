title: "Exiv2 allows Use After Free"
description: "A heap buffer overflow was found in Exiv2 versions v0.28.0 to v0.28.4.
  Versions prior to v0.28.0, such as v0.27.7, are **not** affected. Exiv2 is a command-line
  utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata
  of image files. The heap overflow is triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata
  into a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability
  to gain code execution, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted
  image file.\n\nNote that this bug is only triggered when writing the metadata, which
  is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than reading the metadata. For example,
  to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you need to add an extra
  command-line argument such as `fixiso`."
