title: "Exiv2  has a denial of service due to unbounded recursion in QuickTimeVideo::multipleEntriesDecoder"
description: "A denial-of-service was found in Exiv2 version v0.28.1: an unbounded
  recursion can cause Exiv2 to crash by exhausting the stack. The vulnerable function,
  `QuickTimeVideo::multipleEntriesDecoder`, was new in v0.28.0 (see https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/pull/2337),
  so Exiv2 versions before v0.28 are _not_ affected.  Exiv2 is a command-line utility
  and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata of image
  files. The denial-of-service is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata
  of a crafted video file."
