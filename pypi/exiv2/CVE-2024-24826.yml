title: "Exiv2 has an out-of-bounds read in QuickTimeVideo::NikonTagsDecoder"
description: "An out-of-bounds read was found in Exiv2 version v0.28.1. The vulnerable
  function, `QuickTimeVideo::NikonTagsDecoder`, was new in v0.28.0 (see https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/pull/2337),
  so Exiv2 versions before v0.28 are _not_ affected. Exiv2 is a command-line utility
  and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata of image
  files. The out-of-bounds read is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata
  of a crafted video file."
