package_slug: "pypi/ckan"
title: "Improper Privilege Management"
description: "CKAN is an open-source data management system for powering data hubs
  and data portals. Prior to versions 2.9.9 and 2.10.1, the `ckan` user (equivalent
  to www-data) owned code and configuration files in the docker container and the
  `ckan` user had the permissions to use sudo. These issues allowed for code execution
  or privilege escalation if an arbitrary file write bug was available. Versions 2.9.9,
  2.9.9-dev, 2.10.1, and 2.10.1-dev contain a patch."
