title: "CKAN vulnerable to fixed session IDs"
description: "Session ids could be fixed by an attacker if the site is configured
  with server-side session storage (CKAN uses cookie-based session storage by default).
  The attacker would need to either set a cookie on the victim's browser or steal
  the victim's currently valid session. Session identifiers are now regenerated after
  each login."
