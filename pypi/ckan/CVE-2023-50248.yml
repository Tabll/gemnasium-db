title: "Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency"
description: "CKAN is an open-source data management system for powering data hubs
  and data portals. Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior to versions 2.9.10 and 2.10.3,
  when submitting a POST request to the `/dataset/new` endpoint (including either
  the auth cookie or the `Authorization` header) with a specially-crafted field, an
  attacker can create an out-of-memory error in the hosting server. To trigger this
  error, the attacker need to have permissions to create or edit datasets. This vulnerability
  has been patched in CKAN 2.10.3 and 2.9.10."
