package_slug: "pypi/lightning"
title: "Remote code execution in pytorch lightning"
description: "A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in the lightning-ai/pytorch-lightning
  library version 2.2.1 due to improper handling of deserialized user input and mismanagement
  of dunder attributes by the `deepdiff` library. The library uses `deepdiff.Delta`
  objects to modify application state based on frontend actions. However, it is possible
  to bypass the intended restrictions on modifying dunder attributes, allowing an
  attacker to construct a serialized delta that passes the deserializer allow list
  and contains dunder attributes. When processed, this can be exploited to access
  other modules, classes, and instances, leading to arbitrary attribute write and
  total RCE on any self-hosted pytorch-lightning application in its default configuration,
  as the delta endpoint is enabled by default."
