package_slug: "pypi/fastecdsa"
title: "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature in fastecdsa"
description: "An issue was discovered in fastecdsa before 2.1.2. When using the NIST
  P-256 curve in the ECDSA implementation, the point at infinity is mishandled. This
  means that for an extreme value in k and s<sup>-1</sup>, the signature verification
  fails even if the signature is correct. This behavior is not solely a usability
  problem. There are some threat models where an attacker can benefit by successfully
  guessing users for whom signature verification will fail."
