package_slug: "pypi/fastecdsa"
title: "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature"
description: "When using the NIST P-256 curve in the ECDSA implementation, the point
  at infinity is mishandled. This means that for an extreme value in `k` and `s^-1`,
  the signature verification fails even if the signature is correct. This behavior
  is not solely a usability problem. There are some threat models where an attacker
  can benefit by successfully guessing users for whom signature verification will
  fail."
