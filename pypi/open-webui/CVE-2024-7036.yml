title: "Open WebUI Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability"
description: "A vulnerability in open-webui/open-webui v0.3.8 allows an unauthenticated
  attacker to sign up with excessively large text in the 'name' field, causing the
  Admin panel to become unresponsive. This prevents administrators from performing
  essential user management actions such as deleting, editing, or adding users. The
