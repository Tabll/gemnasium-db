title: "Open WebUI Unauthenticated Multipart Boundary Denial of Service (DoS) Vulnerability
  in api/chat/file"
description: "A vulnerability in open-webui/open-webui version 79778fa allows an attacker
  to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by uploading a file with a malformed multipart
  boundary. By appending a large number of characters to the end of the multipart
  boundary, the server continuously processes each character, rendering the application
  inaccessible. This issue can prevent all users from accessing the application until
  the server recovers."
