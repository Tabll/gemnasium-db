title: "Open WebUI Has Improper Access Control Leading to Arbitrary Prompt Read"
description: "In version v0.3.8 of open-webui/open-webui, improper access control
  vulnerabilities allow an attacker to view any prompts. The application does not
  verify whether the attacker is an administrator, allowing the attacker to directly
  call the /api/v1/prompts/ interface to retrieve all prompt information created by
  the admin, which includes the ID values. Subsequently, the attacker can exploit
  the /api/v1/prompts/command/{command_id} interface to obtain arbitrary prompt information."
