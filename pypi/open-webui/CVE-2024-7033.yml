title: "Open WebUI Allows Arbitrary File Write via the `download_model` Endpoint"
description: "In version 0.3.8 of open-webui/open-webui, an arbitrary file write vulnerability
  exists in the download_model endpoint. When deployed on Windows, the application
  improperly handles file paths, allowing an attacker to manipulate the file path
  to write files to arbitrary locations on the server's filesystem. This can result
  in overwriting critical system or application files, causing denial of service,
  or potentially achieving remote code execution (RCE). RCE can allow an attacker
  to execute malicious code with the privileges of the user running the application,
  leading to a full system compromise."
