title: "Open WebUI Allows Arbitrary File Write via the `/models/upload` Endpoint"
description: "In open-webui version 0.3.8, the endpoint `/models/upload` is vulnerable
  to arbitrary file write due to improper handling of user-supplied filenames. The
  vulnerability arises from the usage of `file_path = f\"{UPLOAD_DIR}/{file.filename}\"`
  without proper input validation or sanitization. An attacker can exploit this by
  manipulating the `file.filename` parameter to include directory traversal sequences,
  causing the resulting `file_path` to escape the intended `UPLOAD_DIR` and potentially
  overwrite arbitrary files on the system. This can lead to unauthorized modifications
  of system binaries, configuration files, or sensitive data, potentially enabling
  remote command execution."
