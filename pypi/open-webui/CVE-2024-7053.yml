title: "Open WebUI Vulnerable to a Session Fixation Attack"
description: "A vulnerability in open-webui/open-webui version 0.3.8 allows an attacker
  with a user-level account to perform a session fixation attack. The session cookie
  for all users is set with the default `SameSite=Lax` and does not have the `Secure`
  flag enabled, allowing the session cookie to be sent over HTTP to a cross-origin
  domain. An attacker can exploit this by embedding a malicious markdown image in
  a chat, which, when viewed by an administrator, sends the admin's session cookie
  to the attacker's server. This can lead to a stealthy administrator account takeover,
  potentially resulting in remote code execution (RCE) due to the elevated privileges
  of administrator accounts."
