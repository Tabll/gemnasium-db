title: "Open WebUI allows Remote Code Execution via Arbitrary File Upload to /audio/api/v1/transcriptions"
description: "OpenWebUI version 0.3.0 contains a vulnerability in the audio API endpoint
  `/audio/api/v1/transcriptions` that allows for arbitrary file upload. The application
  performs insufficient validation on the `file.content_type` and allows user-controlled
  filenames, leading to a path traversal vulnerability. This can be exploited by an
  authenticated user to overwrite critical files within the Docker container, potentially
  leading to remote code execution as the root user."
