title: "open-webui allows enumeration of file names and traversal of directories by
  observing the error messages"
description: "An information disclosure vulnerability exists in open-webui version
  0.3.8. The vulnerability is related to the embedding model update feature under
  admin settings. When a user updates the model path, the system checks if the file
  exists and provides different error messages based on the existence and configuration
  of the file. This behavior allows an attacker to enumerate file names and traverse
  directories by observing the error messages, leading to potential exposure of sensitive
  information."
