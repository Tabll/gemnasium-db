package_slug: "pypi/open-webui"
title: "Open WebUI Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability"
description: "In version v0.3.32 of open-webui/open-webui, the application allows
  users to submit large payloads in the email and password fields during the sign-in
  process due to the lack of character length validation on these inputs. This vulnerability
  can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition when a user submits excessively
  large strings, exhausting server resources such as CPU, memory, and disk space,
  and rendering the service unavailable for legitimate users. This makes the server
  susceptible to resource exhaustion attacks without requiring authentication."
