package_slug: "pypi/copyparty"
title: "copyparty: Sharing a single file does not fully restrict access to other files
  in source folder"
description: "There was a missing permission-check in the shares feature (the `shr`
  global-option).\n\nWhen a share is created for just one file inside a folder, it
  was possible to access the other files inside that folder by guessing the filenames.\n\nIt
  was not possible to descend into subdirectories in this manner; only the sibling
  files were accessible.\n\nThis issue did not affect filekeys or dirkeys."
