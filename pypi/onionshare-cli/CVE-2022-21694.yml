package_slug: "pypi/onionshare-cli"
title: "Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource"
description: "OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and anonymously
  share files, host websites, and chat with friends using the Tor network. The website
  mode of the onionshare allows to use a hardened CSP, which will block any scripts
  and external resources. It is not possible to configure this CSP for individual
  pages and therefore the security enhancement cannot be used for websites using javascript
  or external resources like fonts or images."
