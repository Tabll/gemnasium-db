package_slug: "pypi/onionshare-cli"
title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and anonymously
  share files, host websites, and chat with friends using the Tor network. In affected
  versions the receive mode limits concurrent uploads to 100 per second and blocks
  other uploads in the same second, which can be triggered by a simple script. An
  adversary with access to the receive mode can block file upload for others. There
  is no way to block this attack in public mode due to the anonymity properties of
  the tor network."
