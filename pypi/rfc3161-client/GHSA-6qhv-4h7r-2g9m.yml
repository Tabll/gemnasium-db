title: "rfc3161-client has insufficient verification for timestamp response signatures"
description: "`rfc3161-client` 1.0.2 and earlier contain a flaw in their timestamp
  response signature verification logic. In particular, it performs chain verification
  against the TSR's embedded certificates up to the trusted root(s), but fails to
  verify the TSR's own signature against the timestamping leaf certificates. Consequently,
  vulnerable versions perform insufficient signature validation to properly consider
  a TSR verified, as the attacker can introduce _any_ TSR signature so long as the
  embedded leaf chains up to some root TSA."
