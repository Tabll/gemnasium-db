description: "### Impact\nAny users whom would not desire a traceback to be included
  in their logs whenever an error is raised in their code will be affected.\n\nIf
  users have inadvertently created a scenario in their code that could cause a traceback
  to include sensitive information _and_ a malicious entity gained access to their
  log stream, this could create an issue.\n\n### Patches\nNone yet... users will need
  to upgrade to `0.4.*`\n\n### Workarounds\nNo particularly reasonable ones at present.\n\n###
