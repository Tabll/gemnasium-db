title: "OpenStack keystonemiddleware and python-keystoneclient vulnerable to man-in-the-middle
  attacks"
description: "The s3_token middleware in OpenStack keystonemiddleware before 1.6.0
  and python-keystoneclient before 1.4.0 disables certification verification when
  the \"insecure\" option is set in a paste configuration (paste.ini) file regardless
  of the value, which allows remote attackers to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks
  via a crafted certificate, a different vulnerability than CVE-2014-7144."
