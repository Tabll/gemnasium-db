package_slug: "pypi/python-keystoneclient"
title: "python-keystoneclient vulnerable to context confusion in Keystone auth_token
  middleware"
description: "A context confusion vulnerability was identified in Keystone auth_token
  middleware (shipped in python-keystoneclient) before 0.7.0. By doing repeated requests,
  with sufficient load on the target system, an authenticated user may in certain
  situations assume another authenticated user's complete identity and multi-tenant
  authorizations, potentially resulting in a privilege escalation. Note that it is
  related to a bad interaction between eventlet and python-memcached that should be
  avoided if the calling process already monkey-patches \"thread\" to use eventlet.
  Only keystone middleware setups using auth_token with memcache are vulnerable."
