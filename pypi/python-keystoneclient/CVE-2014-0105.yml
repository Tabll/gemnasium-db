identifier: "CVE-2014-0105"
package_slug: "pypi/python-keystoneclient"
title: "Privilege escalation in auth_token middleware under sufficient load"
description: "By doing repeated requests, with sufficient load on the target system,
  an authenticated user may in certain situations assume another authenticated user's
  complete identity and multi-tenant authorizations, potentially resulting in a privilege
  escalation. Note that it is related to a bad interaction between eventlet and python-memcached
  that should be avoided if the calling process already monkey-patches \"thread\"
  to use eventlet. Only keystone middleware setups using auth_token with memcache
  are vulnerable."
