  search results from malicious projects"
description: "### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability could have allowed an attacker to include
  arbitrary HTML content in search results by having a user search a malicious project.
  This was due to our search client not correctly escaping all user content from search
  results. You can find more information in the [advisory published in our readthedocs.org

  vulnerability was exploited in the wild.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue has been patched
