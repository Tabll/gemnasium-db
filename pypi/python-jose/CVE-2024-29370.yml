title: "Duplicate Advisory: python-jose denial of service via compressed JWE content"
description: "### Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it
  is a duplicate of GHSA-cjwg-qfpm-7377. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n### Original Description\n\nIn python-jose 3.3.0 (specifically jwe.decrypt),
  a vulnerability allows an attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition
  by crafting a malicious JSON Web Encryption (JWE) token with an exceptionally high
  compression ratio. When this token is processed by the server, it results in significant
  memory allocation and processing time during decompression."
