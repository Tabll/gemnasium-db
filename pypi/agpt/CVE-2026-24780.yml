title: "AutoGPT is Vulnerable to RCE via Disabled Block Execution"
description: "AutoGPT Platform's block execution endpoints (both main web API and
  external API) allow executing blocks by UUID without checking the `disabled` flag.
  Any authenticated user can execute the disabled `BlockInstallationBlock`, which
  writes arbitrary Python code to the server filesystem and executes it via `__import__()`,
  achieving Remote Code Execution. In default self-hosted deployments where Supabase
  signup is enabled, an attacker can self-register; if signup is disabled (e.g., hosted),
  the attacker needs an existing account."
