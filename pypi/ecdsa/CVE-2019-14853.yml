package_slug: "pypi/ecdsa"
title: "ecdsa Denial of Service vulnerability in signature verification and signature
  malleability"
description: "Code using `VerifyingKey.verify()` and `VerifyingKey.verify_digest()`
  may receive exceptions other than the documented `BadSignatureError` when signatures
  are malformed. If those other exceptions are not caught, they may lead to program
  termination and thus Denial of Service\n\nCode using `VerifyingKey.verify()` and
  `VerifyingKey.verify_digest()` with `sigdecode` option using `ecdsa.util.sigdecode_der`
  will accept signatures even if they are not properly formatted DER. This makes the
  signatures malleable. It impacts only applications that later sign the signatures
  or verify signatures of signatures, e.g. Bitcoin.\n\nAll versions between 0.5 and
  0.13.2 (inclusive) are thought to be vulnerable. Code before 0.5 may be vulnerable
  but didn't receive extended analysis to rule this issue out."
