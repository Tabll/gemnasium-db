title: "pgAdmin 4 vulnerable to Unsafe Deserialization and Remote Code Execution by
  an Authenticated user"
description: "pgAdmin prior to version 8.4 is affected by a path-traversal vulnerability
  while deserializing usersâ€™ sessions in the session handling code. If the server
  is running on Windows, an unauthenticated attacker can load and deserialize remote
  pickle objects and gain code execution. If the server is running on POSIX/Linux,
  an authenticated attacker can upload pickle objects, deserialize them and gain code
  execution."
