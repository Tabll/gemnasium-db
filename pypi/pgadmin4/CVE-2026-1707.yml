title: "pgadmin4 affected by a Restore restriction bypass via key disclosure vulnerability"
description: "pgAdmin versions 9.11 are affected by a Restore restriction bypass via
  key disclosure vulnerability that occurs when running in server mode and performing
  restores from PLAIN-format dump files. An attacker with access to the pgAdmin web
  interface can observe an active restore operation, extract the `\\restrict` key
  in real time, and race the restore process by overwriting the restore script with
  a payload that re-enables meta-commands using `\\unrestrict <key>`. This results
  in reliable command execution on the pgAdmin host during the restore operation."
