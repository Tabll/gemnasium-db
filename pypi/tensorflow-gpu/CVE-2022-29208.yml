package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow-gpu"
title: "Out-of-bounds Write"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to
  versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.EditDistance`
  has incomplete validation. Users can pass negative values to cause a segmentation
  fault based denial of service. In multiple places throughout the code, one may compute
  an index for a write operation. However, the existing validation only checks against
  the upper bound of the array. Hence, it is possible to write before the array by
  massaging the input to generate negative values for `loc`. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1,
  2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue."
