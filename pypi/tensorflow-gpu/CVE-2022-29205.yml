title: "Use of Uninitialized Resource"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to
  versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, there is a potential for segfault / denial
  of service in TensorFlow by calling `tf.compat.v1.*` ops which don't yet have support
  for quantized types, which was added after migration to TensorFlow 2.x. In these
  scenarios, since the kernel is missing, a `nullptr` value is passed to `ParseDimensionValue`
  for the `py_value` argument. Then, this is dereferenced, resulting in segfault.
  Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue."
