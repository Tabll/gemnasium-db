title: "Integer Overflow or Wraparound"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  An attacker can trigger a denial of service via a `CHECK`-fail in caused by an integer
  overflow in constructing a new tensor shape. This is because the implementation
  builds a dense shape without checking that the dimensions would not result in overflow.
  The `TensorShape` constructor
  uses a `CHECK` operation which triggers when `InitDims`
  returns a non-OK status. This is a legacy implementation of the constructor and
  operations should use `BuildTensorShapeBase` or `AddDimWithStatus` to prevent `CHECK`-failures
  in the presence of overflows. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will
  also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3
  and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range."
