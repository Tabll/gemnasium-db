title: "Integer Overflow or Wraparound"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected
  versions if `tf.image.resize` is called with a large input argument then the TensorFlow
  process will crash due to a `CHECK`-failure caused by an overflow. The number of
  elements in the output tensor is too much for the `int64_t` type and the overflow
  is detected via a `CHECK` statement. This aborts the process. The fix will be included
  in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow
  2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range."
