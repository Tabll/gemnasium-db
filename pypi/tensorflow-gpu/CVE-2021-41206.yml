title: "Improper Validation of Integrity Check Value"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected
  versions several TensorFlow operations are missing validation for the shapes of
  the tensor arguments involved in the call. Depending on the API, this can result
  in undefined behavior and segfault or `CHECK`-fail related crashes but in some scenarios
  writes and reads from heap populated arrays are also possible. We have discovered
  these issues internally via tooling while working on improving/testing GPU op determinism.
  As such, we don't have reproducers and there will be multiple fixes for these issues.
  These fixes will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick these
  commits on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are
  also affected and still in supported range."
