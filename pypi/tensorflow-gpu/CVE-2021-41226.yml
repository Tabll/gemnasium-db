package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow-gpu"
title: "Out-of-bounds Read"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected
  versions the implementation of `SparseBinCount` is vulnerable to a heap OOB access.
  This is because of missing validation between the elements of the `values` argument
  and the shape of the sparse output. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0.
  We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow
  2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range."
