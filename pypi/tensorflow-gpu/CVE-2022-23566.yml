package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow-gpu"
title: "Out-of-bounds Write"
description: "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. TensorFlow
  is vulnerable to a heap OOB write in `Grappler`. The `set_output` function writes
  to an array at the specified index. Hence, this gives a malicious user a write primitive.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected
  and still in supported range."
