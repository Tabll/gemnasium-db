title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to
  versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.ragged.constant`
  does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a denial of service
  by consuming all available memory. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain
  a patch for this issue."
