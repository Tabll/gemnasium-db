title: "Reachable Assertion"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. If `LRNGrad`
  is given an `output_image` input tensor that is not 4-D, it results in a `CHECK`
  fail that can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. We have patched the
  issue in GitHub commit bd90b3efab4ec958b228cd7cfe9125be1c0cf255. The fix will be
  included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still
  in supported range. There are no known workarounds for this issue."
