title: "Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type "
description: "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation
  of shape inference for `ConcatV2` can be used to trigger a denial of service attack
  via a segfault caused by a type confusion. The `axis` argument is translated into
  `concat_dim` in the `ConcatShapeHelper` helper function. Then, a value for `min_rank`
  is computed based on `concat_dim`. This is then used to validate that the `values`
  tensor has at least the required rank. However, `WithRankAtLeast` receives the lower
  bound as a 64-bits value and then compares it against the maximum 32-bits integer
  value that could be represented. Due to the fact that `min_rank` is a 32-bits value
  and the value of `axis`, the `rank` argument is a negative value, so the error check
  is bypassed. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick
  this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these
  are also affected and still in supported range."
