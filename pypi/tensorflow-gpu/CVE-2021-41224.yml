title: "Out-of-bounds Read"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected
  versions the implementation of `SparseFillEmptyRows` can be made to trigger a heap
  OOB access. This occurs whenever the size of `indices` does not match the size of
  `values`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick
  this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these
  are also affected and still in supported range."
