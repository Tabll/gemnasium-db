package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow-gpu"
title: "Integer Overflow or Wraparound"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to
  versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.SpaceToBatchND`
  (in all backends such as XLA and handwritten kernels) is vulnerable to an integer
  overflow: The result of this integer overflow is used to allocate the output tensor,
  hence we get a denial of service via a `CHECK`-failure (assertion failure), as in
  TFSA-2021-198. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this
  issue."
