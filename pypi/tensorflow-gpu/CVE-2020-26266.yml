title: "Uninitialized memory access in TensorFlow"
description: "Under certain cases, a saved model can trigger use of uninitialized
  values during code execution. This is caused by having tensor buffers be filled
  with the default value of the type but forgetting to [default initialize the quantized
  floating point types in Eigen](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/f70160322a579144950dff1537dcbe3c7c09d6f5/third_party/eigen3/unsupported/Eigen/CXX11/src/FixedPoint/FixedPointTypes.h#L61-L104):\n\n```cc\nstruct
