title: "Divide By Zero"
description: "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The estimator
  for the cost of some convolution operations can be made to execute a division by
  0. The function fails to check that the stride argument is strictly positive. Hence,
  the fix is to add a check for the stride argument to ensure it is valid. The fix
  will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still
  in supported range."
