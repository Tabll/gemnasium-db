title: "NULL Pointer Dereference"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected
  versions the shape inference code for `DeserializeSparse` can trigger a null pointer
  dereference. This is because the shape inference function assumes that the `serialize_sparse`
  tensor is a tensor with positive rank . The
  fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on
  TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected
  and still in supported range."
