title: "NULL Pointer Dereference"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  Sending invalid argument for `row_partition_types` of `tf.raw_ops.RaggedTensorToTensor`
  API results in a null pointer dereference and undefined behavior. The implementation
  accesses the first element of a user supplied list of values without validating
  that the provided list is not empty. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
  301ae88b331d37a2a16159b65b255f4f9eb39314. The fix will be included in TensorFlow
  2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3,
  and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range."
