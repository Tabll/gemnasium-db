title: "Divide By Zero"
description: "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. An attacker
  can craft a TFLite model that would trigger a division by zero in `BiasAndClamp`
  implementation. There is no check that the `bias_size` is non zero. The fix will
  be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still
  in supported range."
