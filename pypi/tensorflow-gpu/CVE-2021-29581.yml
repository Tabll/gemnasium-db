package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow-gpu"
title: "Use of Uninitialized Resource"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  Due to lack of validation in `tf.raw_ops.CTCBeamSearchDecoder`, an attacker can
  trigger denial of service via segmentation faults. The implementation
  fails to detect cases when the input tensor is empty and proceeds to read data from
  a null buffer. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick
  this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
  2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range."
