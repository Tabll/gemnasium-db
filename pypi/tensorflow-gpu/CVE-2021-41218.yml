title: "Divide By Zero"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected
  versions the shape inference code for `AllToAll` can be made to execute a division
  by 0. This occurs whenever the `split_count` argument is 0. The fix will be included
  in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow
  2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range."
