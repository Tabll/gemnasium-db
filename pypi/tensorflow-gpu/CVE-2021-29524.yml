title: "Divide By Zero"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  An attacker can trigger a division by 0 in `tf.raw_ops.Conv2DBackpropFilter`. This
  is because the implementation
  does a modulus operation where the divisor is controlled by the caller. The fix
  will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also
  affected and still in supported range."
