title: "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.MaxPool3DGradGrad` is vulnerable to a heap buffer
  overflow. The implementation
  does not check that the initialization of `Pool3dParameters` completes successfully.
  Since the constructor
  uses `OP_REQUIRES` to validate conditions, the first assertion that fails interrupts
  the initialization of `params`, making it contain invalid data. In turn, this might
  cause a heap buffer overflow, depending on default initialized values. The fix will
  be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also
  affected and still in supported range."
