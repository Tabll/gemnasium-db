title: "Reachable Assertion in Tensorflow"
description: "When decoding a tensor from protobuf, a TensorFlow process can encounter
  cases where a `CHECK` assertion is invalidated based on user controlled arguments,
  if the tensors have an invalid `dtype` and 0 elements or an invalid shape. This
  allows attackers to cause denial of services in TensorFlow processes."
