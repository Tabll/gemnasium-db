title: "Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input "
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  Missing validation between arguments to `tf.raw_ops.Conv3DBackprop*` operations
  can result in heap buffer overflows. This is because the implementation
  assumes that the `input`, `filter_sizes` and `out_backprop` tensors have the same
  shape, as they are accessed in parallel. The fix will be included in TensorFlow
  2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3,
  TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported
  range."
