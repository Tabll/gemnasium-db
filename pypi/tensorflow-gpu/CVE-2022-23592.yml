package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow-gpu"
title: "Out-of-bounds Read"
description: "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. TensorFlow's
  type inference can cause a heap out of bounds read as the bounds checking is done
  in a `DCHECK` . An attacker can control the
  `input_idx` variable such that `ix` would be larger than the number of values in
  `node_t.args`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. This is the only affected
  version."
