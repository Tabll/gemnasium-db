title: "Divide By Zero"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  An attacker can cause a runtime division by zero error and denial of service in
  `tf.raw_ops.QuantizedBatchNormWithGlobalNormalization`. This is because the implementation
  does not validate all constraints specified in the op's contract.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as
  these are also affected and still in supported range."
