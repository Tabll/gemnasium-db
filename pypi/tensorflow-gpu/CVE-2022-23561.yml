title: "Out-of-bounds Write"
description: "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. An attacker
  can craft a TFLite model that would cause a write outside of bounds of an array
  in TFLite. In fact, the attacker can override the linked list used by the memory
  allocator. This can be leveraged for an arbitrary write primitive under certain
  conditions. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick
  this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these
  are also affected and still in supported range."
