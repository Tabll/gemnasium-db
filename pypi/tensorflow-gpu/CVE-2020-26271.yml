title: "Heap out of bounds access in MakeEdge in TensorFlow"
description: "Under certain cases, loading a saved model can result in accessing uninitialized
  memory while building the computation graph. The [`MakeEdge` function](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/3616708cb866365301d8e67b43b32b46d94b08a0/tensorflow/core/common_runtime/graph_constructor.cc#L1426-L1438)
  creates an edge between one output tensor of the `src` node (given by `output_index`)
  and the input slot of the `dst` node (given by `input_index`). This is only possible
  if the types of the tensors on both sides coincide, so the function begins by obtaining
  the corresponding `DataType` values and comparing these for equality:\n\n```cc\nDataType
  src_out = src->output_type(output_index);\nDataType dst_in = dst->input_type(input_index);\n//...\n```\n\nHowever,
  there is no check that the indices point to inside of the arrays they index into.
  Thus, this can result in accessing data out of bounds of the corresponding heap
  allocated arrays.\n\nIn most scenarios, this can manifest as unitialized data access,
  but if the index points far away from the boundaries of the arrays this can be used
  to leak addresses from the library."
