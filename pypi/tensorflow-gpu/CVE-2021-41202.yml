title: "Overflow/crash in `tf.range`"
description: "While calculating the size of the output within the `tf.range` kernel,
  there is a conditional statement of type `int64 = condition ? int64 : double`. Due
  to C++ implicit conversion rules, both branches of the condition will be cast to
  `double` and the result would be truncated before the assignment. This result in
  overflows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ntf.sparse.eye(num_rows=9223372036854775807,
  num_columns=None)\n```\n\nSimilarly, `tf.range` would result in crashes due to overflows
  if the start or end point are too large.\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ntf.range(start=-1e+38,
  limit=1)\n```"
