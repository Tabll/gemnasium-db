title: "Write to immutable memory region in TensorFlow"
description: "The `tf.raw_ops.ImmutableConst` operation returns a constant tensor
  created from a memory mapped file which is assumed immutable. However, if the type
  of the tensor is not an integral type, the operation crashes the Python interpreter
  as it tries to write to the memory area:\n\n```python\n>>> import tensorflow as
  tf\n>>> with open('/tmp/test.txt','w') as f: f.write('a'*128)\n>>> tf.raw_ops.ImmutableConst(dtype=tf.string,shape=2,\nmemory_region_name='/tmp/test.txt')\n```\n\nIf
  the file is too small, TensorFlow properly returns an error as the memory area has
  fewer bytes than what is needed for the tensor it creates. However, as soon as there
  are enough bytes, the above snippet causes a segmentation fault."
