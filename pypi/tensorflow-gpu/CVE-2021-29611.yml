title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  Incomplete validation in `SparseReshape` results in a denial of service based on
  a `CHECK`-failure. The implementation
  has no validation that the input arguments specify a valid sparse tensor. The fix
  will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.4.2 and TensorFlow 2.3.3, as these are the only affected versions."
