title: "Null-dereference in Tensorflow"
description: "When decoding a tensor from protobuf, TensorFlow might do a null-dereference
  if attributes of some mutable arguments to some operations are missing from the
  proto. This is [guarded by a `DCHECK`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a1320ec1eac186da1d03f033109191f715b2b130/tensorflow/core/framework/full_type_util.cc#L104-L106):\n\n```cc\nconst
  auto* attr = attrs.Find(arg->s());\nDCHECK(attr != nullptr);\nif (attr->value_case()
  == AttrValue::kList) {\n// ...\n}\n```\nHowever, `DCHECK` is a no-op in production
  builds and an assertion failure in debug builds. In the first case execution proceeds
  to the dereferencing of the null pointer, whereas in the second case it results
  in a crash due to the assertion failure."
