title: "Reachable Assertion"
description: "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. A malicious
  user can cause a denial of service by altering a `SavedModel` such that `TensorByteSize`
  would trigger `CHECK` failures. `TensorShape` constructor throws a `CHECK`-fail
  if shape is partial or has a number of elements that would overflow the size of
  an `int`. The `PartialTensorShape` constructor instead does not cause a `CHECK`-abort
  if the shape is partial, which is exactly what this function needs to be able to
  return `-1`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick
  this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these
  are also affected and still in supported range."
