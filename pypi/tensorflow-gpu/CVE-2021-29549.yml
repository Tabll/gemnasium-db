title: "Divide By Zero"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  An attacker can cause a runtime division by zero error and denial of service in
  `tf.raw_ops.QuantizedBatchNormWithGlobalNormalization`. This is because the implementation
  computes a modulo operation without validating that the divisor is not zero. Since
  `vector_num_elements` is determined based on input shapes,
  a user can trigger scenarios where this quantity is 0. The fix will be included
  in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow
  2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still
  in supported range."
