identifier: "CVE-2020-15198"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow-gpu"
title: "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer"
description: "In Tensorflow, the `SparseCountSparseOutput` implementation does not
  validate that the input arguments form a valid sparse tensor. In particular, there
  is no validation that the `indices` tensor has the same shape as the `values` one.
  The values in these tensors are always accessed in parallel. Thus, a shape mismatch
  can result in accesses outside the bounds of heap allocated buffers."
