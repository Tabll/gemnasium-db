title: "Divide By Zero"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  In affected versions an attacker can cause denial of service in applications serving
  models using `tf.raw_ops.UnravelIndex` by triggering a division by 0. The implementation
  does not check that the tensor subsumed by `dims` is not empty. Hence, if one element
  of `dims` is 0, the implementation does a division by 0. We have patched the issue
  in GitHub commit a776040a5e7ebf76eeb7eb923bf1ae417dd4d233. The fix will be included
  in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow
  2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range."
