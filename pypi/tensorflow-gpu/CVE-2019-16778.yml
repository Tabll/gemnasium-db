package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow-gpu"
title: "Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types"
description: "In TensorFlow before 1.15, a heap buffer overflow in UnsortedSegmentSum
  can be produced when the Index template argument is int32. In this case data_size
  and num_segments fields are truncated from int64 to int32 and can produce negative
  numbers, resulting in accessing out of bounds heap memory. This is unlikely to be
  exploitable and was detected and fixed internally in TensorFlow 1.15 and 2.0."
