title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. During shape
  inference, TensorFlow can allocate a large vector based on a value from a tensor
  controlled by the user. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also
  cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3,
  as these are also affected and still in supported range."
