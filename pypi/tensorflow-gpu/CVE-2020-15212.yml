identifier: "CVE-2020-15212"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow-gpu"
title: "Out-of-bounds Write"
description: "In TensorFlow Lite, models using segment sum can trigger writes outside
  of bounds of heap allocated buffers by inserting negative elements in the segment
  ids tensor. Users having access to `segment_ids_data` can alter `output_index` and
  then write to outside `output_data` buffer. This might result in a segmentation
  fault but it can also be used to further corrupt the memory and can be chained with
  other vulnerabilities to create more advanced exploits."
