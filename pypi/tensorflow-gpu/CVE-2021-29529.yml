title: "Off-by-one Error"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  An attacker can trigger a heap buffer overflow in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizedResizeBilinear`
  by manipulating input values so that float rounding results in off-by-one error
  in accessing image elements. This is because the implementation
  computes two integers 
  by ceiling and flooring a floating point value. For some values of `in`, `interpolation->upperi
  might be smaller than `interpolation->loweri]`. This is an issue if `interpolation->upper[i
  is capped at `in_size-1` as it means that `interpolation->loweri
  of the image. Then, in the interpolation code,
  this would result in heap buffer overflow. The fix will be included in TensorFlow
  2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3,
  TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported
  range."
