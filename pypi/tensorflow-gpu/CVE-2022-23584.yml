title: "Use After Free"
description: "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. A malicious
  user can cause a use after free behavior when decoding PNG images. After `png::CommonFreeDecode`
  gets called, the values of `decode.width` and `decode.height` are in an unspecified
  state. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this
  commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are
  also affected and still in supported range."
