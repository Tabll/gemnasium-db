title: "Out-of-bounds Write"
description: "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. There is a
  typo in TensorFlow's `SpecializeType` which results in heap OOB read/write. Due
  to a typo, `arg` is initialized to the `i`th mutable argument in a loop where the
  loop index is `j`. Hence it is possible to assign to `arg` from outside the vector
  of arguments. Since this is a mutable proto value, it allows both read and write
  to outside of bounds data. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will
  also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, and TensorFlow 2.6.3, as these
  are also affected and still in supported range."
