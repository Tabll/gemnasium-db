title: "Reachable Assertion"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. The implementation
  of `AvgPoolGrad` does not fully validate the input `orig_input_shape`. This results
  in a `CHECK` failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. We
  have patched the issue in GitHub commit 3a6ac52664c6c095aa2b114e742b0aa17fdce78f.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected
  and still in supported range. There are no known workarounds for this issue."
