package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow-gpu"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "In affected versions of TensorFlow running an LSTM/GRU model where the
  LSTM/GRU layer receives an input with zero-length results in a CHECK failure when
  using the CUDA backend. This can result in a query-of-death vulnerability, via denial
  of service, if users can control the input to the layer. This is fixed in versions
  1.15.5, 2.0.4, 2.1.3, 2.2.2, 2.3.2, and 2.4.0."
