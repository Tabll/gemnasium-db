title: "Divide By Zero"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  In affected versions an attacker can trigger a crash via a floating point exception
  in `tf.raw_ops.ResourceGather`. The implementation
  computes the value of a value, `batch_size`, and then divides by it without checking
  that this value is not 0. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit ac117ee8a8ea57b73d34665cdf00ef3303bc0b11.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected
  and still in supported range."
