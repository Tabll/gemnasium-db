title: "Use After Free"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected
  versions the async implementation of `CollectiveReduceV2` suffers from a memory
  leak and a use after free. This occurs due to the asynchronous computation and the
  fact that objects that have been `std::move`d from are still accessed. The fix
  will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.6.1, as this version is the only one that is also affected."
