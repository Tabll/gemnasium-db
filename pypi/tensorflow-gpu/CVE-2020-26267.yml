identifier: "CVE-2020-26267"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow-gpu"
title: "Out-of-bounds Read"
description: "In affected versions of TensorFlow the `tf.raw_ops.DataFormatVecPermute`
  API does not validate the `src_format` and `dst_format` attributes. The code assumes
  that these two arguments define a permutation of `NHWC`. This can result in uninitialized
  memory accesses, read outside of bounds and even crashes."
