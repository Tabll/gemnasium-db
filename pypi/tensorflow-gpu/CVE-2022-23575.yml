title: "Integer Overflow or Wraparound"
description: "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation
  of `OpLevelCostEstimator::CalculateTensorSize` is vulnerable to an integer overflow
  if an attacker can create an operation which would involve a tensor with large enough
  number of elements. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick
  this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these
  are also affected and still in supported range."
