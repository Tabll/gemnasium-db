title: "Reachable Assertion"
description: "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. A malicious
  user can cause a denial of service by altering a `SavedModel` such that assertions
  in `function.cc` would be falsified and crash the Python interpreter. The fix will
  be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still
  in supported range."
