title: "Out-of-bounds Write"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. The `ScatterNd`
  function takes an input argument that determines the indices of of the output tensor.
  An input index greater than the output tensor or less than zero will either write
  content at the wrong index or trigger a crash. We have patched the issue in GitHub
  commit b4d4b4cb019bd7240a52daa4ba61e3cc814f0384. The fix will be included in TensorFlow
  2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1,
  and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range. There
  are no known workarounds for this issue."
