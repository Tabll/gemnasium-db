title: "Divide By Zero"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  In affected versions the implementations of pooling in TFLite are vulnerable to
  division by 0 errors as there are no checks for divisors not being 0. We have patched
  the issue in GitHub commit dfa22b348b70bb89d6d6ec0ff53973bacb4f4695
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected
  and still in supported range."
