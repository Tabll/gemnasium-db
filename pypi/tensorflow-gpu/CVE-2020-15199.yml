identifier: "CVE-2020-15199"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow-gpu"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "In Tensorflow, the `RaggedCountSparseOutput` does not validate that
  the input arguments form a valid ragged tensor. In particular, there is no validation
  that the `splits` tensor has the minimum required number of elements. Code uses
  this quantity to initialize a different data structure. Since `BatchedMap` is equivalent
  to a vector, it needs to have at least one element to not be `nullptr`. If user
  passes a `splits` tensor that is empty or has exactly one element, we get a `SIGABRT`
  signal raised by the operating system."
