identifier: "CVE-2020-15197"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow-gpu"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "In Tensorflow, the `SparseCountSparseOutput` implementation does not
  validate that the input arguments form a valid sparse tensor. In particular, there
  is no validation that the `indices` tensor has rank This tensor must be a matrix
  because code assumes its elements are accessed as elements of a matrix. However,
  malicious users can pass in tensors of different rank, resulting in a `CHECK` assertion
  failure and a crash. This can be used to cause denial of service in serving installations,
  if users are allowed to control the components of the input sparse tensor."
