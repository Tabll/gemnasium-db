package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow-gpu"
title: "Out of bounds write in grappler in Tensorflow"
description: "### Impact\nThe function 
  [MakeGrapplerFunctionItem](https://https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/grappler/utils/functions.cc#L221)
  takes arguments that determine the sizes of inputs and outputs. If the inputs given
  are greater than or equal to the sizes of the outputs, an out-of-bounds memory read
  or a crash is triggered.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit
  [a65411a1d69edfb16b25907ffb8f73556ce36bb7](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/a65411a1d69edfb16b25907ffb8f73556ce36bb7).\n\nThe
  fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on
  TensorFlow 2.10.1.\n\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult 
  [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md)
