title: "Integer Overflow or Wraparound"
description: "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. An attacker
  can craft a TFLite model that would cause an integer overflow in `TfLiteIntArrayCreate`.
  The `TfLiteIntArrayGetSizeInBytes` returns an `int` instead of a `size_t. An attacker
  can control model inputs such that `computed_size` overflows the size of `int` datatype.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected
  and still in supported range."
