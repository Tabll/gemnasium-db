identifier: "CVE-2020-15191"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow-gpu"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "In Tensorflow, if a user passes an invalid argument to `dlpack.to_dlpack`
  the expected validations will cause variables to bind to `nullptr` while setting
  a `status` variable to the error condition. However, this `status` argument is not
  properly checked. Hence, code following these methods will bind references to null
  pointers. This is undefined behavior and reported as an error if compiling with
  `-fsanitize=null`."
