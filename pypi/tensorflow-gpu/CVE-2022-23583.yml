title: "`CHECK`-failures in binary ops in Tensorflow"
description: "A malicious user can cause a denial of service by altering a `SavedModel`
  such that [any binary op](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a1320ec1eac186da1d03f033109191f715b2b130/tensorflow/core/kernels/cwise_ops_common.h#L88-L137)
  would trigger `CHECK` failures. This occurs when the protobuf part corresponding
  to the tensor arguments is modified such that the `dtype` no longer matches the
  `dtype` expected by the op. In that case, calling the templated binary operator
  for the binary op would receive corrupted data, due to the type confusion involved:\n\n```cc\nfunctor::BinaryFunctor<Device,
  Functor, 1>()(\neigen_device, out->template flat<Tout>(),\ninput_0.template flat<Tin>(),
  input_1.template flat<Tin>(),\nerror_ptr);\n```\nIf `Tin` and `Tout` don't match
  the type of data in `out` and `input_*` tensors then `flat<*>` would interpret it
  wrongly. In most cases, this would be a silent failure, but we have noticed scenarios
  where this results in a `CHECK` crash, hence a denial of service."
