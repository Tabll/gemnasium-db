title: "Divide By Zero"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. If `Conv2D`
  is given empty `input` and the `filter` and `padding` sizes are valid, the output
  is all-zeros. This causes division-by-zero floating point exceptions that can be
  used to trigger a denial of service attack. We have patched the issue in GitHub
  commit 611d80db29dd7b0cfb755772c69d60ae5bca05f9. The fix will be included in TensorFlow
  2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1,
  and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range. There
  are no known workarounds for this issue."
