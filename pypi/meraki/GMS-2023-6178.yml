title: "Improper validation in meraki"
description: "aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio
  and Python. Improper validation made it possible for an attacker to modify the HTTP
  request (e.g. to insert a new header) or create a new HTTP request if the attacker
  controls the HTTP version. The vulnerability only occurs if the attacker can control
  the HTTP version of the request. This issue has been patched in version 3.9.0.\n\nmeraki
  from version 1.40.1 requires aiohttp 3.9.0"
