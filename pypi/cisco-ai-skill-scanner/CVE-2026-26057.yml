title: "Skill-scanner Unsecured Network Binding Vulnerability"
description: "**Description:**\nA vulnerability in the API Server of Skill Scanner
  could allow a unauthenticated, remote attacker to interact with the server API and
  either trigger a denial of service (DoS) condition or upload arbitrary files.\n\nThis
  vulnerability is due to an erroneous binding to multiple interfaces. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by sending API requests to a device exposing the
  affected API Server. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to consume an
  excessive amount of resources (memory starvation) or to upload files to arbitrary
  folders on the affected device.\n\n**Conditions:**\nThis vulnerability affects Skill-scanner
  1.0.1 and earlier releases when the API Server is enabled. The API Server is not
  enabled by default.\n\n**Fixed Software:**\nSkill-scanner software releases 1.0.2
  and later contained the fix for this vulnerability.\n\n**For more information:**\nIf
  you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n- [Open an issue in cisco-ai-defense/skill-scanner](https://github.com/cisco-ai-defense/skill-scanner/issues)\n-
