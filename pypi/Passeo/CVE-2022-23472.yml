package_slug: "pypi/Passeo"
title: "Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)"
description: "Passeo is an open source python password generator. Versions prior to
  1.0.5 rely on the python `random` library for random value selection. The python
  `random` library warns that it should not be used for security purposes due to its
  reliance on a non-cryptographically secure random number generator. As a result
  a motivated attacker may be able to guess generated passwords. This issue has been
  addressed in version 1.0.5. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
  for this vulnerability."
