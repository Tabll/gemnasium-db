package_slug: "pypi/jupyterhub"
title: "Cross site scripting (XSS) in JupyterHub via Self-XSS leveraged by Cookie
  Tossing"
description: "Affected configurations:\n\n- Single-origin JupyterHub deployments\n-
  JupyterHub deployments with user-controlled applications running on subdomains or
  peer subdomains of either the Hub or a single-user server.\n\nBy tricking a user
  into visiting a malicious subdomain, the attacker can achieve an XSS directly affecting
  the former's session. More precisely, in the context of JupyterHub, this XSS could
  achieve the following:\n\n- Full access to JupyterHub API and user's single-user
  server, e.g.\n- Create and exfiltrate an API Token\n- Exfiltrate all files hosted
  on the user's single-user server: notebooks, images, etc.\n- Install malicious extensions.
  They can be used as a backdoor to silently regain access to victim's session anytime."
