title: "internetarchive Vulnerable to Directory Traversal in File.download()"
description: "**What kind of vulnerability is it?**\nThis is a **Critical** severity
  directory traversal (path traversal) vulnerability in the `File.download()` method
  of the `internetarchive` library.\n\n**Who is impacted?**\nAll users of the `internetarchive`
  library versions `< 5.5.1` are impacted. The vulnerability is particularly critical
  for users on **Windows systems**, but all operating systems are affected.\n\n**Description
  of the vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability existed because the `file.download()`
  method did not properly sanitize user-supplied filenames or validate the final download
  path. A maliciously crafted filename could contain path traversal sequences (e.g.,
  `../../../../windows/system32/file.txt`) or illegal characters that, when processed,
  would cause the file to be written outside of the intended target directory.\n\n**Potential
  Impact:**\nAn attacker could potentially overwrite critical system files or application
  configuration files, leading to a denial of service, privilege escalation, or remote
  code execution, depending on the context in which the library is used."
