package_slug: "pypi/django-ses"
title: "Incorrect signature verification in django-ses"
description: "The django_ses library implements a mail backend for Django using AWS
  Simple Email Service. The library exports the `SESEventWebhookView class` intended
  to receive signed requests from AWS to handle email bounces, subscriptions, etc.
  These requests are signed by AWS and are verified by django_ses, however the verification
  of this signature was found to be flawed as it allowed users to specify arbitrary
  public certificates."
