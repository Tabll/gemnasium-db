package_slug: "pypi/django-ses"
title: "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature"
description: "Django-SES is a drop-in mail backend for Django. The django_ses library
  implements a mail backend for Django using AWS Simple Email Service. The library
  exports the `SESEventWebhookView class` intended to receive signed requests from
  AWS to handle email bounces, subscriptions, etc. These requests are signed by AWS
  and are verified by django_ses, however the verification of this signature was found
  to be flawed as it allowed users to specify arbitrary public certificates. This
  issue was patched in version 3.5.0."
