identifier: "CVE-2020-15239"
package_slug: "pypi/xmpp-http-upload"
title: "Path Traversal"
description: "In xmpp-http-upload, when the GET method is attacked, attackers can
  read files which have a `.data` suffix and which are accompanied by a JSON file
  with the `.meta` suffix. This can lead to Information Disclosure and in some shared-hosting
  scenarios also to circumvention of authentication or other limitations on the outbound
  (GET) traffic. For example, in a scenario where a single server has multiple instances
  of the application running (with separate DATA_ROOT settings), an attacker who has
  knowledge about the directory structure is able to read files from any other instance
  to which the process has read access. If instances have individual authentication
  (for example, HTTP authentication via a reverse proxy, source IP based filtering)
  or other restrictions (such as quotas), attackers may circumvent those limits in
  such a scenario by using the Directory Traversal to retrieve data from the other
  instances. If the associated XMPP server (or anyone knowing the SECRET_KEY) is malicious,
  they can write files outside the DATA_ROOT. The files which are written are constrained
  to have the `.meta` and the `.data` suffixes; the `.meta` file will contain the
  JSON with the Content-Type of the original request and the `.data` file will contain
  the payload. The issue is patched "
