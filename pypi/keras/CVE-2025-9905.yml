title: "The Keras `Model.load_model` method **silently** ignores `safe_mode=True`
  and allows arbitrary code execution when a `.h5`/`.hdf5` file is loaded."
description: "When a model in the `.h5` (or `.hdf5`) format is loaded using the Keras
  `Model.load_model` method, the `safe_mode=True` setting is **silently** ignored
  without any warning or error. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code
  on the victim’s machine with the same privileges as the Keras application. This
  report is specific to the `.h5`/`.hdf5` file format. The attack works regardless
  of the other parameters passed to `load_model` and does not require any sophisticated
  technique—`.h5` and `.hdf5` files are simply not checked for unsafe code execution.\n\nFrom
  this point on, I will refer only to the `.h5` file format, though everything equally
  applies to `.hdf5`."
