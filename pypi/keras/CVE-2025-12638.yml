title: "Duplicate Advisory: Keras keras.utils.get_file API is vulnerable to a path
  traversal attack"
description: "### Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it
  is a duplicate of GHSA-hjqc-jx6g-rwp9. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n### Original Description\nKeras version 3.11.3 is affected by a path
  traversal vulnerability in the keras.utils.get_file() function when extracting tar
  archives. The vulnerability arises because the function uses Python's tarfile.extractall()
  method without the security-critical filter='data' parameter. Although Keras attempts
  to filter unsafe paths using filter_safe_paths(), this filtering occurs before extraction,
  and a PATH_MAX symlink resolution bug triggers during extraction. This bug causes
  symlink resolution to fail due to path length limits, resulting in a security bypass
  that allows files to be written outside the intended extraction directory. This
  can lead to arbitrary file writes outside the cache directory, enabling potential
  system compromise or malicious code execution. The vulnerability affects Keras installations
  that process tar archives with get_file() and does not affect versions where this
  extraction method is secured with the appropriate filter parameter."
