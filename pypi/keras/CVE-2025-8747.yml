title: "Keras vulnerable to CVE-2025-1550 bypass via reuse of internal functionality"
description: "It is possible to bypass the mitigation introduced in response to [CVE-2025-1550](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/security/advisories/GHSA-48g7-3x6r-xfhp),
  when an untrusted Keras v3 model is loaded, even when “safe_mode” is enabled, by
  crafting malicious arguments to built-in Keras modules.\n\nThe vulnerability is
  exploitable on the default configuration and does not depend on user input (just
  requires an untrusted model to be loaded)."
