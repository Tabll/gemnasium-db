title: "Keras Directory Traversal Vulnerability"
description: "Keras's `keras.utils.get_file()` function is vulnerable to directory
  traversal attacks despite implementing `filter_safe_paths()`. The vulnerability
  exists because `extract_archive()` uses Python's `tarfile.extractall()` method without
  the security-critical `filter=\"data\"` parameter. A PATH_MAX symlink resolution
  bug occurs before path filtering, allowing malicious tar archives to bypass security
  checks and write files outside the intended extraction directory."
