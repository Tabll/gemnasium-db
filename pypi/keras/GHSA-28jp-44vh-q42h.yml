title: "Duplicate Advisory: Keras keras.utils.get_file API is vulnerable to a path
  traversal attack"
description: "### Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it
  is a duplicate of GHSA-hjqc-jx6g-rwp9. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n### Original Description\nThe keras.utils.get_file API in Keras,
  when used with the extract=True option for tar archives, is vulnerable to a path
  traversal attack. The utility uses Python's tarfile.extractall function without
  the filter=\"data\" feature. A remote attacker can craft a malicious tar archive
  containing special symlinks, which, when extracted, allows them to write arbitrary
  files to any location on the filesystem outside of the intended destination folder.
  This vulnerability is linked to the underlying Python tarfile weakness, identified
  as CVE-2025-4517. Note that upgrading Python to one of the versions that fix CVE-2025-4517
  (e.g. Python 3.13.4) is not enough. One additionally needs to upgrade Keras to a
  version with the fix (Keras 3.12)."
