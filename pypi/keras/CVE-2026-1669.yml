title: "Keras has a Local File Disclosure via HDF5 External Storage During Keras Weight
  Loading"
description: "TensorFlow / Keras continues to honor HDF5 “external storage” and `ExternalLink`
  features when loading weights. A malicious `.weights.h5` (or a `.keras` archive
  embedding such weights) can direct `load_weights()` to read from an arbitrary readable
  filesystem path. The bytes pulled from that path populate model tensors and become
  observable through inference or subsequent re-save operations. Keras “safe mode”
  only guards object deserialization and does not cover weight I/O, so this behaviour
  persists even with safe mode enabled. The issue is confirmed on the latest publicly
  released stack (`tensorflow 2.20.0`, `keras 3.11.3`, `h5py 3.15.1`, `numpy 2.3.4`)."
