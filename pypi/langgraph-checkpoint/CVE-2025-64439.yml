title: "LangGraph Checkpoint affected by RCE in \"json\" mode of JsonPlusSerializer "
description: "Prior to `langgraph-checkpoint` version `3.0` , LangGraph’s `JsonPlusSerializer`
  (used as the default serialization protocol for all checkpointing) contains a remote
  code execution (RCE) vulnerability when deserializing payloads saved in the `\"json\"`
  serialization mode.\n\nIf an attacker can cause your application to persist a payload
  serialized in this mode, they may be able to also send malicious content that executes
  arbitrary Python code during deserialization.\n\nUpgrading to version langgraph-checkpoint
  `3.0` patches this vulnerability by preventing deserialization of custom objects
  saved in this mode.\n\nIf you are deploying in `langgraph-api`, any version `0.5`
  or later is also free of this vulnerability."
