title: "AstrBot contains a directory traversal vulnerability"
description: "AstrBot Project v3.5.22 contains a directory traversal vulnerability.
  The handler function install_plugin_upload of the interface '/plugin/install-upload'
  parses the filename from the request body provided by the user, and directly uses
  the filename to assign to file_path without checking the validity of the filename.
  The variable file_path is then passed as a parameter to the function `file.save`,
  so that the file in the request body can be saved to any location in the file system
  through directory traversal."
