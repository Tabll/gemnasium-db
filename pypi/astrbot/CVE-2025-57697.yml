title: "AstrBot has an arbitrary file read vulnerability in function _encode_image_bs64"
description: "AstrBot Project v3.5.22 has an arbitrary file read vulnerability in
  function _encode_image_bs64. Since the _encode_image_bs64 function defined in entities.py
  opens the image specified by the user in the request body and returns the image
  content as a base64-encoded string without checking the legitimacy of the image
  path, attackers can construct a series of malicious URLs to read any specified file,
  resulting in sensitive data leakage."
