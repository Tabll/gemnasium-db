title: " Werkzeug safe_join() allows Windows special device names"
description: "Werkzeug's `safe_join` function allows Windows device names as filenames
  if when preceded by other path segments.\n\nThis was previously reported as https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/security/advisories/GHSA-hgf8-39gv-g3f2,
  but the added filtering failed to account for the fact that `safe_join` accepts
  paths with multiple segments, such as `example/NUL`.\n\n`send_from_directory` uses
  `safe_join` to safely serve files at user-specified paths under a directory. If
  the application is running on Windows, and the requested path ends with a special
  device name, the file will be opened successfully, but reading will hang indefinitely."
