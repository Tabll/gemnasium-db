package_slug: "pypi/Werkzeug"
title: "Werkzeug safe_join() allows Windows special device names"
description: "Werkzeug's `safe_join` function allows path segments with Windows device
  names. On Windows, there are special device names such as `CON`, `AUX`, etc that
  are implicitly present and readable in every directory. `send_from_directory` uses
  `safe_join` to safely serve files at user-specified paths under a directory. If
  the application is running on Windows, and the requested path ends with a special
  device name, the file will be opened successfully, but reading will hang indefinitely."
