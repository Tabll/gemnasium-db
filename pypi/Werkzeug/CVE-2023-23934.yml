title: "Incorrect parsing of nameless cookies leads to __Host- cookies bypass"
description: "Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. Browsers may
  allow \"nameless\" cookies that look like `=value` instead of `key=value`. A vulnerable
  browser may allow a compromised application on an adjacent subdomain to exploit
  this to set a cookie like `=__Host-test=bad` for another subdomain. Werkzeug prior
  to 2.2.3 will parse the cookie `=__Host-test=bad` as __Host-test=bad`. If a Werkzeug
  application is running next to a vulnerable or malicious subdomain which sets such
  a cookie using a vulnerable browser, the Werkzeug application will see the bad cookie
  value but the valid cookie key. The issue is fixed in Werkzeug 2.2.3."
