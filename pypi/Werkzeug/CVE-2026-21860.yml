title: " Werkzeug safe_join() allows Windows special device names with compound extensions"
description: "Werkzeug's `safe_join` function allows path segments with Windows device
  names that have file extensions or trailing spaces. On Windows, there are special
  device names such as `CON`, `AUX`, etc that are implicitly present and readable
  in every directory. Windows still accepts them with any file extension, such as
  `CON.txt`, or trailing spaces such as `CON `.\n\nThis was previously reported as
  https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/security/advisories/GHSA-hgf8-39gv-g3f2, but
  the fix failed to account for compound extensions such as `CON.txt.html` or trailing
  spaces. It also missed some additional special names.\n\n`send_from_directory` uses
  `safe_join` to safely serve files at user-specified paths under a directory. If
  the application is running on Windows, and the requested path ends with a special
  device name, the file will be opened successfully, but reading will hang indefinitely."
