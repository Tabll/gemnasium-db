title: "Access of Uninitialized Pointer"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affeced
  versions during execution, `EinsumHelper::ParseEquation` is supposed to set the
  flags in `input_has_ellipsis` vector and `*output_has_ellipsis` boolean to indicate
  whether there is ellipsis in the corresponding inputs and output. However, the code
  only changes these flags to `true` and never assigns `false`. This results in unitialized
  variable access if callers assume that `EinsumHelper::ParseEquation` always sets
  these flags. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick
  this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these
  are also affected and still in supported range."
