identifier: "CVE-2020-15193"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow-cpu"
title: "Use of Uninitialized Resource"
description: "In Tensorflow, the implementation of `dlpack.to_dlpack` can be made
  to use uninitialized memory resulting in further memory corruption. This is because
  the pybind11 glue code assumes that the argument is a tensor. However, there is
  nothing stopping users from passing in a Python object instead of a tensor. The
  uninitialized memory address is due to a `reinterpret_cast` Since the `PyObject`
  is a Python object, not a TensorFlow Tensor, the cast to `EagerTensor` fails."
