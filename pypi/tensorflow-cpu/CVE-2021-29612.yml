title: "Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input "
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  An attacker can trigger a heap buffer overflow in Eigen implementation of `tf.raw_ops.BandedTriangularSolve`.
  The implementation
  calls `ValidateInputTensors` for input validation but fails to validate that the
  two tensors are not empty. Furthermore, since `OP_REQUIRES` macro only stops execution
  of current function after setting `ctx->status` to a non-OK value, callers of
  helper functions that use `OP_REQUIRES` must check value of `ctx->status` before
  continuing. This doesn't happen in this op's implementation,
  hence the validation that is present is also not effective. The fix will be included
  in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow
  2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still
  in supported range."
