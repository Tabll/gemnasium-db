package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow-cpu"
title: "Access of Uninitialized Pointer"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  In affected versions an attacker can cause undefined behavior via binding a reference
  to null pointer in `tf.raw_ops.RaggedTensorToVariant`. The implementation
  has an incomplete validation of the splits values, missing the case when the argument
  would be empty. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit be7a4de6adfbd303ce08be4332554dff70362612.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected
  and still in supported range."
