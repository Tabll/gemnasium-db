title: "NULL Pointer Dereference"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  An attacker can trigger a dereference of a null pointer in `tf.raw_ops.StringNGrams`.
  This is because the implementation
  does not fully validate the `data_splits` argument. This would result in `ngrams_data`
  to be a null pointer when the output would be computed to have 0 or negative size.
  Later writes to the output tensor would then cause a null pointer dereference. The
  fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on
  TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these
  are also affected and still in supported range."
