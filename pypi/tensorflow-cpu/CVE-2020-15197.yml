package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow-cpu"
title: "Denial of Service in Tensorflow"
description: "The `SparseCountSparseOutput` implementation does not validate that
  the input arguments form a valid sparse tensor. In particular, there is no validation
  that the `indices` tensor has rank 2. This tensor must be a matrix because code
  assumes its elements are accessed as elements of a matrix:\nhttps://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0e68f4d3295eb0281a517c3662f6698992b7b2cf/tensorflow/core/kernels/count_ops.cc#L185\n\nHowever,
  malicious users can pass in tensors of different rank, resulting in a `CHECK` assertion
  failure and a crash. This can be used to cause denial of service in serving installations,
  if users are allowed to control the components of the input sparse tensor."
