identifier: "CVE-2020-15213"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow-cpu"
title: "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer"
description: "In TensorFlow Lite, models using segment sum can trigger a denial of
  service by causing an out of memory allocation in the implementation of segment
  sum. Since code uses the last element of the tensor holding them to determine the
  dimensionality of output tensor, attackers can use a very large value to trigger
  a large allocation."
