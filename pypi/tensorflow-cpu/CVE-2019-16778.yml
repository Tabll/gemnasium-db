title: "Heap buffer overflow in `UnsortedSegmentSum` in TensorFlow"
description: "A heap buffer overflow in `UnsortedSegmentSum` can be produced when
  the `Index` template argument is `int32`. In this case `data_size` and `num_segments`
  fields are truncated from `int64` to `int32` and can produce negative numbers, resulting
  in accessing out of bounds heap memory.\n\nThis is unlikely to be exploitable and
  was detected and fixed internally. We are making the security advisory only to notify
  users that it is better to update to TensorFlow 1.15 or 2.0 or later as these versions
  already have this fixed."
