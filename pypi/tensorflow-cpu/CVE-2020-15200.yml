identifier: "CVE-2020-15200"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow-cpu"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "In Tensorflow, the `RaggedCountSparseOutput` implementation does not
  validate that the input arguments form a valid ragged tensor. In particular, there
  is no validation that the values in the `splits` tensor generate a valid partitioning
  of the `values` tensor. Thus, the code sets up conditions to cause a heap buffer
  overflow. A `BatchedMap` is equivalent to a vector where each element is a hashmap.
  However, if the first element of `splits_values` is not 0, `batch_idx` will never
  be 1, hence there will be no hashmap at index 0 in `per_batch_counts`. Trying to
  access that in the user code results in a segmentation fault."
