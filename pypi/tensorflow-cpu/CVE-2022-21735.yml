title: "Divide By Zero"
description: "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation
  of `FractionalMaxPool` can be made to crash a TensorFlow process via a division
  by 0. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this
  commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are
  also affected and still in supported range."
