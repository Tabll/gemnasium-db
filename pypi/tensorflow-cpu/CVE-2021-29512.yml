title: "Out-of-bounds Write"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  If the `splits` argument of `RaggedBincount` does not specify a valid `SparseTensor`,
  then an attacker can trigger a heap buffer overflow. This will cause a read from
  outside the bounds of the `splits` tensor buffer in the implementation of the `RaggedBincount`
  op.
  Before the `for` loop, `batch_idx` is set to 0. The user controls the `splits` array,
  making it contain only one element, 0. Thus, the code in the `while` loop would
  increment `batch_idx` and then try to read `splits`, which is outside of bounds.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow 2.4.2 and TensorFlow 2.3.3, as these are also affected."
