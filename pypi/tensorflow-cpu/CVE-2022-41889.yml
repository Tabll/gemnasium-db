package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow-cpu"
title: "NULL Pointer Dereference"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. If a list
  of quantized tensors is assigned to an attribute, the pywrap code fails to parse
  the tensor and returns a `nullptr`, which is not caught. An example can be seen
  in `tf.compat.v1.extract_volume_patches` by passing in quantized tensors as input
  `ksizes`. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit e9e95553e5411834d215e6770c81a83a3d0866ce.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and
  still in supported range."
