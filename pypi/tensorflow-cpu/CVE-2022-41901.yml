package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow-cpu"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. An input
  `sparse_matrix` that is not a matrix with a shape with rank 0 will trigger a `CHECK`
  fail in `tf.raw_ops.SparseMatrixNNZ`. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
  f856d02e5322821aad155dad9b3acab1e9f5d693. The fix will be included in TensorFlow
  2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow
  2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range."
