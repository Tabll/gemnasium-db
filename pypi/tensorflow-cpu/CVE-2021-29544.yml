package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow-cpu"
title: "Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  An attacker can trigger a denial of service via a `CHECK`-fail in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeAndDequantizeV4Grad`.
  This is because the implementation
  does not validate the rank of the `input_*` tensors. In turn, this results in the
  tensors being passes as they are to `QuantizeAndDequantizePerChannelGradientImpl`.
  However, the `vec<T>` method, requires the rank to 1 and triggers a `CHECK` failure
  otherwise. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick
  this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2 as this is the only other affected version."
