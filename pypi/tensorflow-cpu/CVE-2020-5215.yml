title: "Segmentation faultin TensorFlow when converting a Python string to `tf.float16`"
description: "Converting a string (from Python) to a `tf.float16` value results in
  a segmentation fault in eager mode as the format checks for this use case are only
  in the graph mode.\n\nThis issue can lead to denial of service in inference/training
  where a malicious attacker can send a data point which contains a string instead
  of a `tf.float16` value.\n\nSimilar effects can be obtained by manipulating saved
  models and checkpoints whereby replacing a scalar `tf.float16` value with a scalar
  string will trigger this issue due to automatic conversions.\n\nThis can be easily
  reproduced by `tf.constant(\"hello\", tf.float16)`, if eager execution is enabled."
