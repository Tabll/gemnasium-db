package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow-cpu"
title: "Data corruption in tensorflow-lite"
description: "When determining the common dimension size of two tensors, TFLite uses
  a `DCHECK` which is no-op outside of debug compilation modes:\nhttps://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0e68f4d3295eb0281a517c3662f6698992b7b2cf/tensorflow/lite/kernels/internal/types.h#L437-L442\n\nSince
  the function always returns the dimension of the first tensor, malicious attackers
  can craft cases where this is larger than that of the second tensor. In turn, this
  would result in reads/writes outside of bounds since the interpreter will wrongly
  assume that there is enough data in both tensors."
