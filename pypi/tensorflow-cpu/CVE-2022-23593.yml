package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow-cpu"
title: "Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions"
description: "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The `simplifyBroadcast`
  function in the MLIR-TFRT infrastructure in TensorFlow is vulnerable to a segfault
  , if called with scalar shapes. If all shapes are scalar,
  then `maxRank` is 0, so we build an empty `SmallVector`. The fix will be included
  in TensorFlow 2.8.0. This is the only affected version."
