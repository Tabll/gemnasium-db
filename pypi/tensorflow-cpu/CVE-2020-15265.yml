identifier: "CVE-2020-15265"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow-cpu"
title: "Out-of-bounds Read"
description: "In Tensorflow, an attacker can pass an invalid `axis` value to `tf.quantization.quantize_and_dequantize`.
  This results in accessing a dimension outside the rank of the input tensor in the
  C++ kernel implementation. However, `dim_size` only does a `DCHECK` to validate
  the argument and then uses it to access the corresponding element of an array. Since
  in normal builds, `DCHECK`-like macros are no-ops, this results in segfault and
  access out-of-bounds of the array."
