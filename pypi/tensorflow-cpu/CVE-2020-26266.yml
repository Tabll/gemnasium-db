title: "Use of Uninitialized Resource"
description: "In affected versions of TensorFlow under certain cases a saved model
  can trigger use of uninitialized values during code execution. This is caused by
  having tensor buffers be filled with the default value of the type but forgetting
  to default initialize the quantized floating point types in Eigen. This is fixed
  in versions 1.15.5, 2.0.4, 2.1.3, 2.2.2, 2.3.2, and 2.4.0."
