package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow-cpu"
title: "Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected
  versions an attacker can trigger undefined behavior, integer overflows, segfaults
  and `CHECK`-fail crashes if they can change saved checkpoints from outside of TensorFlow.
  This is because the checkpoints loading infrastructure is missing validation for
  invalid file formats. The fixes will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also
  cherrypick these commits on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4,
  as these are also affected and still in supported range."
