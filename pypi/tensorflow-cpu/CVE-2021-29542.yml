title: "Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  An attacker can cause a heap buffer overflow by passing crafted inputs to `tf.raw_ops.StringNGrams`.
  This is because the implementation
  fails to consider corner cases where input would be split in such a way that the
  generated tokens should only contain padding elements. If input is such that `num_tokens`
  is 0, then, for `data_start_index=0` , the marked
  line would result in reading `data-1
  2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3,
  TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported
  range."
