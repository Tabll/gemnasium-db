title: "Segfault due to negative splits in `SplitV`"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected
  versions the implementation of `SplitV` can trigger a segfault is an attacker supplies
  negative arguments. This occurs whenever `size_splits` contains more than one value
  and at least one value is negative. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0.
  We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow
  2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range."
