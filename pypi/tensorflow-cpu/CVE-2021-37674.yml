title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  In affected versions an attacker can trigger a denial of service via a segmentation
  fault in `tf.raw_ops.MaxPoolGrad` caused by missing validation. The implementation
  misses some validation for the `orig_input` and `orig_output` tensors. The fixes
  for CVE-2021-29579 were incomplete. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 136b51f10903e044308cf77117c0ed9871350475.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected
  and still in supported range."
