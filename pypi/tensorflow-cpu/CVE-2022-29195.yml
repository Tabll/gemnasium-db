package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow-cpu"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to
  versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.StagePeek`
  does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which
  can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. The code assumes `index` is a
  scalar but there is no validation for this before accessing its value. Versions
  2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue."
