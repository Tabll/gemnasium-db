package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow-cpu"
title: "Use of Uninitialized Resource"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected
  versions TensorFlow's Grappler optimizer has a use of unitialized variable. If the
  `train_nodes` vector  does not
  contain a `Dequeue` node, then `dequeue_node` is left unitialized. The fix will
  be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still
  in supported range."
