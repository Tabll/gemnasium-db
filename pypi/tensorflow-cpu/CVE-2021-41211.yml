title: "Heap OOB in shape inference for `QuantizeV2`"
description: "The shape inference code for `QuantizeV2` can trigger a read outside of bounds 
  of heap allocated array. The code allows `axis` to be an optional argument (`s` would contain 
  an `error::NOT_FOUND` error code). Otherwise, it assumes that `axis` is a valid index into 
  the dimensions of the `input` tensor. If `axis` is less than `-1` then this results in a 
  heap OOB read."
