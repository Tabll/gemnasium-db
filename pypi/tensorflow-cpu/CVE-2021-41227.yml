package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow-cpu"
title: "Out-of-bounds Read"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected
  versions the `ImmutableConst` operation in TensorFlow can be tricked into reading
  arbitrary memory contents. This is because the `tstring` TensorFlow string class
  has a special case for memory mapped strings but the operation itself does not offer
  any support for this datatype. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We
  will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow
  2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range."
