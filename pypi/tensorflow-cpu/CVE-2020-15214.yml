identifier: "CVE-2020-15214"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow-cpu"
title: "Out-of-bounds Write"
description: "In TensorFlow Lite, models using segment sum can trigger a segmentation
  fault if the segment ids are not sorted. Code assumes that the segment ids are in
  increasing order, using the last element of the tensor holding them to determine
  the dimensionality of output tensor. This results in allocating insufficient memory
  for the output tensor and in an out-of-bounds-write to the output array."
