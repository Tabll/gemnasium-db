title: "Integer overflow in Tensorflow"
description: "The [implementation of `OpLevelCostEstimator::CalculateOutputSize`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a1320ec1eac186da1d03f033109191f715b2b130/tensorflow/core/grappler/costs/op_level_cost_estimator.cc#L1598-L1617)
  is vulnerable to an integer overflow if an attacker can create an operation which
  would involve tensors with large enough number of elements:\n```cc\nfor (const auto&
  dim : output_shape.dim()) {\noutput_size *= dim.size();\n}\n```\n\nHere, we can
  have a large enough number of dimensions in `output_shape.dim()` or just a small
  number of dimensions being large enough to cause an overflow in the multiplication."
