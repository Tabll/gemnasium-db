package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow-cpu"
title: "Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type "
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  Calling TF operations with tensors of non-numeric types when the operations expect
  numeric tensors result in null pointer dereferences. The conversion from Python
  array to C++ array
  is vulnerable to a type confusion. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.
  We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow
  2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range."
