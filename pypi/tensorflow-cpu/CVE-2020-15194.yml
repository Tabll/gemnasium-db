identifier: "CVE-2020-15194"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow-cpu"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "In Tensorflow, the `SparseFillEmptyRowsGrad` implementation has incomplete
  validation of the shapes of its arguments. Although `reverse_index_map_t` and `grad_values_t`
  are accessed in a similar pattern, only `reverse_index_map_t` is validated to be
  of proper shape. Hence, malicious users can pass a bad `grad_values_t` to trigger
  an assertion failure in `vec`, causing denial of service in serving installations."
