title: "Segfault on strings tensors with mistmatched dimensions, due to Go code"
description: "Under certain conditions, Go code can trigger a segfault in string deallocation.\n\n\nFor
  string tensors, `C.TF_TString_Dealloc` is called during garbage collection within
  a finalizer function.  However, tensor structure isn't checked until encoding to
  avoid a performance penalty.  The current method for dealloc assumes that encoding
  succeeded, but segfaults when a string tensor is garbage collected whose encoding
  failed (e.g., due to mismatched dimensions).\n\nTo fix this, the call to set the
  finalizer function is deferred until `NewTensor` returns and, if encoding failed
  for a string tensor, deallocs are determined based on bytes written."
