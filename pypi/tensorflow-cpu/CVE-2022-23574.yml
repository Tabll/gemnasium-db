package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow-cpu"
title: "Out of bounds read and write in Tensorflow"
description: "There is a typo in TensorFlow's [`SpecializeType`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a1320ec1eac186da1d03f033109191f715b2b130/tensorflow/core/framework/full_type_util.cc#L81-L102)
  which results in heap OOB read/write:\n\n```cc\nfor (int i = 0; i < op_def.output_arg_size();
  i++) {\n// ...\nfor (int j = 0; j < t->args_size(); j++) {\nauto* arg = t->mutable_args(i);\n//
  ...\n}\n}\n```\n\nDue to a typo, `arg` is initialized to the `i`th mutable argument
  in a loop where the loop index is `j`. Hence it is possible to assign to `arg` from
  outside the vector of arguments. Since this is a mutable proto value, it allows
  both read and write to outside of bounds data."
