package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow-cpu"
title: "Out of bounds access in tensorflow-lite"
description: "In TensorFlow Lite models using segment sum can trigger writes outside
  of bounds of heap allocated buffers by inserting negative elements in the segment
  ids tensor:\nhttps://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0e68f4d3295eb0281a517c3662f6698992b7b2cf/tensorflow/lite/kernels/internal/reference/reference_ops.h#L2625-L2631\n\nUsers
  having access to `segment_ids_data` can alter `output_index` and then write to outside
  of `output_data` buffer.\n\nThis might result in a segmentation fault but it can
  also be used to further corrupt the memory and can be chained with other vulnerabilities
  to create more advanced exploits."
