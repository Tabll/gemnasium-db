package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow-cpu"
title: "Access of Uninitialized Pointer"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  In affected versions an attacker can generate undefined behavior via a reference
  binding to nullptr in `BoostedTreesCalculateBestGainsPerFeature` and similar attack
  can occur in `BoostedTreesCalculateBestFeatureSplitV2`. The implementation
  does not validate the input values. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 9c87c32c710d0b5b53dc6fd3bfde4046e1f7a5ad
  and in commit 429f009d2b2c09028647dd4bb7b3f6f414bbaad7. The fix will be included
  in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow
  2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range."
