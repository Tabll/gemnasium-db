package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow-cpu"
title: "Access of Uninitialized Pointer"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected
  versions during TensorFlow's Grappler optimizer phase, constant folding might attempt
  to deep copy a resource tensor. This results in a segfault, as these tensors are
  supposed to not change. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also
  cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4,
  as these are also affected and still in supported range."
