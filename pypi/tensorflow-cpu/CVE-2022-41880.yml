title: "Out-of-bounds Read"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. When the
  `BaseCandidateSamplerOp` function receives a value in `true_classes` larger than
  `range_max`, a heap oob read occurs. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
  b389f5c944cadfdfe599b3f1e4026e036f30d2d4. The fix will be included in TensorFlow
  2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow
  2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range."
