title: "Session operations in eager mode lead to null pointer dereferences"
description: "In eager mode (default in TF 2.0 and later), session operations are
  invalid. However, users could still call the raw ops associated with them and trigger
  a null pointer dereference:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.raw_ops.GetSessionTensor(handle=['\\x12\\x1a\\x07'],dtype=4)\n```\n```python\nimport
  tensorflow as tf\ntf.raw_ops.DeleteSessionTensor(handle=['\\x12\\x1a\\x07'])\n```"
