package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow-cpu"
title: "Out-of-bounds Write"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected
  versions the shape inference function for `Transpose` is vulnerable to a heap buffer
  overflow. This occurs whenever `perm` contains negative elements. The shape inference
  function does not validate that the indices in `perm` are all valid. The fix will
  be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still
  in supported range."
