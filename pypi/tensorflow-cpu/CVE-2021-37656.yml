title: "Access of Uninitialized Pointer"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  In affected versions an attacker can cause undefined behavior via binding a reference
  to null pointer in `tf.raw_ops.RaggedTensorToSparse`. The implementation
  has an incomplete validation of the splits values: it does not check that they are
  in increasing order. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 1071f554dbd09f7e101324d366eec5f4fe5a3ece.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected
  and still in supported range."
