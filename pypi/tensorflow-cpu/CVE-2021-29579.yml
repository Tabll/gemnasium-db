title: "Out-of-bounds Write"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.MaxPoolGrad` is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow.
  The implementation
  fails to validate that indices used to access elements of input/output arrays are
  valid. Whereas accesses to `input_backprop_flat` are guarded by `FastBoundsCheck`,
  the indexing in `out_backprop_flat` can result in OOB access. The fix will be included
  in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow
  2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still
  in supported range."
