package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow-cpu"
title: "Heap buffer overflow in Tensorflow"
description: "The `SparseCountSparseOutput` implementation does not validate that
  the input arguments form a valid sparse tensor. In particular, there is no validation
  that the `indices` tensor has the same shape as the `values` one. The values in
  these tensors are always accessed in parallel:\nhttps://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0e68f4d3295eb0281a517c3662f6698992b7b2cf/tensorflow/core/kernels/count_ops.cc#L193-L195\n\nThus,
  a shape mismatch can result in accesses outside the bounds of heap allocated buffers."
