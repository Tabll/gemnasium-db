title: "`CHECK`-fails due to attempting to build a reference tensor"
description: "A malicious user can cause a denial of service by altering a `SavedModel`
  such that [Grappler optimizer would attempt to build a tensor using a reference
  `dtype`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a1320ec1eac186da1d03f033109191f715b2b130/tensorflow/core/grappler/optimizers/constant_folding.cc#L1328-L1402).
  This would result in a crash due to a `CHECK`-fail [in the `Tensor` constructor](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a1320ec1eac186da1d03f033109191f715b2b130/tensorflow/core/framework/tensor.cc#L733-L781)
  as reference types are not allowed."
