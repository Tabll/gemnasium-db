package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow-cpu"
title: "Denial of Service in Tensorflow"
description: "The `RaggedCountSparseOutput` does not validate that the input arguments
  form a valid ragged tensor. In particular, there is no validation that the `splits`
  tensor has the minimum required number of elements. Code uses this quantity to initialize
  a different data structure:\nhttps://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0e68f4d3295eb0281a517c3662f6698992b7b2cf/tensorflow/core/kernels/count_ops.cc#L241-L244\n\nSince
  `BatchedMap` is equivalent to a vector, it needs to have at least one element to
  not be `nullptr`. If user passes a `splits` tensor that is empty or has exactly
  one element, we get a `SIGABRT` signal raised by the operating system."
