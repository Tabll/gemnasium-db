title: "NULL Pointer Dereference"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to
  versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.QuantizedConv2D`
  does not fully validate the input arguments. In this case, references get bound
  to `nullptr` for each argument that is empty. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and
  2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue."
