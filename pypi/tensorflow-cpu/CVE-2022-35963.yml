package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow-cpu"
title: "Reachable Assertion"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. The implementation
  of `FractionalAvgPoolGrad` does not fully validate the input `orig_input_tensor_shape`.
  This results in an overflow that results in a `CHECK` failure which can be used
  to trigger a denial of service attack. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
  03a659d7be9a1154fdf5eeac221e5950fec07dad. The fix will be included in TensorFlow
  2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1,
  and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range. There
  are no known workarounds for this issue."
