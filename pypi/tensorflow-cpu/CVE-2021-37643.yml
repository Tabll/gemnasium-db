title: "NULL Pointer Dereference"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  If a user does not provide a valid padding value to `tf.raw_ops.MatrixDiagPartOp`,
  then the code triggers a null pointer dereference  or produces
  invalid behavior, ignoring all values after the first. The implementation
  reads the first value from a tensor buffer without first checking that the tensor
  has values to read from. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 482da92095c4d48f8784b1f00dda4f81c28d2988.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected
  and still in supported range."
