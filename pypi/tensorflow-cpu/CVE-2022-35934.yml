title: "TensorFlow vulnerable to `CHECK` failure in tf.reshape via overflows"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. The implementation
  of tf.reshape op in TensorFlow is vulnerable to a denial of service via CHECK-failure
  (assertion failure) caused by overflowing the number of elements in a tensor. This
  issue has been patched in GitHub commit 61f0f9b94df8c0411f0ad0ecc2fec2d3f3c33555.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected
  and still in supported range. There are no known workarounds for this issue."
