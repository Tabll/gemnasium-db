title: "Null pointer dereference in tensorflow-lite"
description: "A crafted TFLite model can force a node to have as input a tensor backed
  by a `nullptr` buffer. This can be achieved by changing a buffer index in the flatbuffer
  serialization to convert a read-only tensor to a read-write one. The runtime assumes
  that these buffers are written to before a possible read, hence they are initialized
  with `nullptr`:\nhttps://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0e68f4d3295eb0281a517c3662f6698992b7b2cf/tensorflow/lite/core/subgraph.cc#L1224-L1227\n\nHowever,
  by changing the buffer index for a tensor and implicitly converting that tensor
  to be a read-write one, as there is nothing in the model that writes to it, we get
  a null pointer dereference."
