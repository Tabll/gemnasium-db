title: "Incomplete validation in boosted trees code"
description: "The [code for boosted trees in TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/e0b6e58c328059829c3eb968136f17aa72b6c876/tensorflow/core/kernels/boosted_trees/stats_ops.cc)
  is still missing validation. As a result, attackers can trigger denial of service
  (via dereferencing `nullptr`s or via `CHECK`-failures) as well as abuse undefined
  behavior (binding references to `nullptr`s). An attacker can also read and write
  from heap buffers, depending on the API that gets used and the arguments that are
  passed to the call.\n\n**Note**: Given that the boosted trees implementation in
  TensorFlow is unmaintained, it is recommend to no longer use these APIs.  Instead,
  please use the downstream [TensorFlow Decision Forests](https://github.com/tensorflow/decision-forests)
  project which is newer and supports more features. We will deprecate TensorFlow's
  boosted trees APIs in subsequent releases."
