title: "NULL Pointer Dereference"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected
  versions the code for boosted trees in TensorFlow is still missing validation. As
  a result, attackers can trigger denial of service (via dereferencing `nullptr`s
  or via `CHECK`-failures) as well as abuse undefined behavior (binding references
  to `nullptr`s). An attacker can also read and write from heap buffers, depending
  on the API that gets used and the arguments that are passed to the call. Given that
  the boosted trees implementation in TensorFlow is unmaintained, it is recommend
  to no longer use these APIs. We will deprecate TensorFlow's boosted trees APIs in
  subsequent releases. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also
  cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4,
  as these are also affected and still in supported range."
