title: "Divide By Zero"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  An attacker can cause a runtime division by zero error and denial of service in
  `tf.raw_ops.FractionalAvgPool`. This is because the implementation
  computes a divisor quantity by dividing two user controlled values. The user controls
  the values of `input_sizei]` and `pooling_ratio_[i
  `pooling_ratio` arguments). If the value in `input_sizei
  `pooling_ratio_i]`, then the floor operation results in `output_size[i
  0. The `DCHECK_GT` line is a no-op outside of debug mode, so in released versions
  of TF this does not trigger. Later, these computed values are used as arguments
  to `GeneratePoolingSequence`.
  There, the first computation is a division in a modulo operation. Since `output_length`
  can be 0, this results in runtime crashing. The fix will be included in TensorFlow
  2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3,
  TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported
  range."
