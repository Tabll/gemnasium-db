title: "Unsafe deserialization in confire"
description: "An exploitable vulnerability exists in the YAML parsing functionality
  in config.py in Confire 0.2.0. Due to the user-specific configuration being loaded
  from \"~/.confire.yaml\" using the yaml.load function, a YAML parser can execute
  arbitrary Python commands resulting in command execution. An attacker can insert
  Python into loaded YAML to trigger this vulnerability."
