title: "Poetry vulnerable to Untrusted Search Path leading to Local Code Execution
  on Windows"
description: "This vulnerability can lead to Arbitrary Code Execution, which would
  lead to the takeover of the system. If a developer is exploited, the attacker could
  steal credentials or persist their access. If the exploit happens on a server, the
  attackers could use their access to attack other internal systems.\nSince this vulnerability
  requires a fair amount of user interaction, it is not as dangerous as a remotely
  exploitable one. However, it still puts developers at risk when dealing with untrusted
  files in a way they think is safe, because the exploit still works when the victim
  tries to make\n\nsure nothing can happen, e.g. by checking that the referenced Git
  dependency is not malicious and points to a trusted Git repository.\nThe victim
  could also not protect themself by vetting any Git or Poetry config files that might
  be present in the directory, because the behavior is undocumented. This kind of
  attack vector has been used in the past to target security researchers by sending
  them projects to collaborate on, so we believe that there is a non-negligible risk."
