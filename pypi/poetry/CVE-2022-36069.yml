title: "Poetry Argument Injection can lead to Local Code Execution"
description: "This vulnerability can lead to Arbitrary Code Execution, which would
  lead to the takeover of the system. If a developer is exploited, the attacker could
  steal credentials or persist their access. If the exploit happens on a server, the
  attackers could use their access to attack other internal systems.\nSince this vulnerability
  requires a fair amount of user interaction, it is not as dangerous as a remotely
  exploitable one. However, it still puts developers at risk when dealing with untrusted
  files in a way they think is safe, because the exploit still works when the victim
  tries to make sure nothing can happen, e.g. by vetting any Git or Poetry config
  files that might be present in the directory.\nThis kind of attack vector has been
  used in the past to target security researchers by sending them projects to collaborate
  on, so we believe that there is a non-negligible risk."
