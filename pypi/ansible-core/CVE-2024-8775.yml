title: "Ansible vulnerable to Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File"
description: "A flaw was found in Ansible, where sensitive information stored in Ansible
  Vault files can be exposed in plaintext during the execution of a playbook. This
  occurs when using tasks such as include_vars to load vaulted variables without setting
  the no_log: true parameter, resulting in sensitive data being printed in the playbook
  output or logs. This can lead to the unintentional disclosure of secrets like passwords
  or API keys, compromising security and potentially allowing unauthorized access
  or actions."
