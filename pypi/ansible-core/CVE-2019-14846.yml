description: "In Ansible, all Ansible Engine versions up to ansible-engine 2.8.5,
  ansible-engine 2.7.13, ansible-engine 2.6.19, were logging at the DEBUG level which
  lead to a disclosure of credentials if a plugin used a library that logged credentials
  at the DEBUG level. This flaw does not affect Ansible modules, as those are executed
  in a separate process."
