title: "llama-index-packs-finchat SQL Injection vulnerability"
description: "A vulnerability in the FinanceChatLlamaPack of the llama-index-packs-finchat
  package, versions up to v0.3.0, allows for SQL injection in the `run_sql_query`
  function of the `database_agent`. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker
  to inject arbitrary SQL queries, leading to remote code execution (RCE) through
  the use of PostgreSQL's large object functionality.\n\nThe issue is resolved by
  no longer officially supporting the package and moving it into the `stale_packages`
  branch on the repo, this removing it from documentation etc."
