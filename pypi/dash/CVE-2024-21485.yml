title: "Dash apps vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting"
description: "Versions of the package dash-core-components before 2.13.0; versions
  of the package dash-core-components before 2.0.0; versions of the package dash before
  2.15.0; versions of the package dash-html-components before 2.0.0; versions of the
  package dash-html-components before 2.0.16 are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting
  (XSS) when the href of the a tag is controlled by an adversary. An authenticated
  attacker who stores a view that exploits this vulnerability could steal the data
  that's visible to another user who opens that view - not just the data already included
  on the page, but they could also, in theory, make additional requests and access
  other data accessible to this user. In some cases, they could also steal the access
  tokens of that user, which would allow the attacker to act as that user, including
  viewing other apps and resources hosted on the same server.\n\n**Note:**\n\nThis
  is only exploitable in Dash apps that include some mechanism to store user input
  to be reloaded by a different user."
