title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "Versions of the package dash-core-components before 2.13.0; all versions
  of the package dash-core-components; versions of the package dash before 2.15.0;
  all versions of the package dash-html-components; versions of the package dash-html-components
  before 2.0.16 is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) when the href of the a
  tag is controlled by an adversary. An authenticated attacker who stores a view that
  exploits this vulnerability could steal the data that's visible to another user
  who opens that view - not just the data already included on the page, but they could
  also, in theory, make additional requests and access other data accessible to this
  user. In some cases, they could also steal the access tokens of that user, which
  would allow the attacker to act as that user, including viewing other apps and resources
  hosted on the same server.\r\r**Note:**\r\rThis is only exploitable in Dash apps
  that include some mechanism to store user input to be reloaded by a different user."
