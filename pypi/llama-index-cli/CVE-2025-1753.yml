title: "LLama-Index CLI OS command injection vulnerability"
description: "LLama-Index CLI prior to v0.4.1, corresponding to LLama-Index prior
  to v0.12.21, contains an OS command injection vulnerability. The vulnerability arises
  from the improper handling of the `--files` argument, which is directly passed into
  `os.system`. An attacker who controls the content of this argument can inject and
  execute arbitrary shell commands. This vulnerability can be exploited locally if
  the attacker has control over the CLI arguments, and remotely if a web application
  calls the LLama-Index CLI with a user-controlled filename. This issue can lead to
  arbitrary code execution on the affected system."
