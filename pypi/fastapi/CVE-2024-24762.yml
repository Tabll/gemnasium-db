package_slug: "pypi/fastapi"
title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "FastAPI is a web framework for building APIs with Python 3.8+ based
  on standard Python type hints. When using form data, `python-multipart` uses a Regular
  Expression to parse the HTTP `Content-Type` header, including options. An attacker
  could send a custom-made `Content-Type` option that is very difficult for the RegEx
  to process, consuming CPU resources and stalling indefinitely (minutes or more)
  while holding the main event loop. This means that process can't handle any more
  requests. It's a ReDoS(Regular expression Denial of Service), it only applies to
  those reading form data, using `python-multipart`. This vulnerability has been patched
  in version 0.109.0."
