title: "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in FastAPI"
description: "FastAPI versions lower than `0.65.2` that used cookies for authentication
  in path operations that received JSON payloads sent by browsers were vulnerable
  to a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack.\n\nIn versions lower than `0.65.2`,
  FastAPI would try to read the request payload as JSON even if the `content-type`
  header sent was not set to `application/json` or a compatible JSON media type (e.g.
  `application/geo+json`).\n\nSo, a request with a content type of `text/plain` containing
  JSON data would be accepted and the JSON data would be extracted.\n\nBut requests
  with content type `text/plain` are exempt from [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)
  preflights, for being considered [Simple requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#simple_requests).
  So, the browser would execute them right away including cookies, and the text content
  could be a JSON string that would be parsed and accepted by the FastAPI application."
