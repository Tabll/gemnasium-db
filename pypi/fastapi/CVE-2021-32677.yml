identifier: "CVE-2021-32677"
package_slug: "pypi/fastapi"
title: "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
description: "FastAPI is a web framework for building APIs with Python The request
  data is now parsed as JSON only if the content-type header is application/json or
  another JSON compatible media type like application/geo+json. It's best to upgrade
  to the latest FastAPI, but if updating is not possible then a middleware or a dependency
  that checks the content-type header and aborts the request if it is not application/json
  or another JSON compatible content type can act as a mitigating workaround."
