package_slug: "pypi/pyrofork"
title: "Pyrofork has a Path Traversal in download_media Method"
description: "The `download_media` method in Pyrofork does not sanitize filenames
  received from Telegram messages before using them in file path construction. This
  allows a remote attacker to write files to arbitrary locations on the filesystem
  by sending a specially crafted document with path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`)
  or absolute paths in the filename.\n\n---"
