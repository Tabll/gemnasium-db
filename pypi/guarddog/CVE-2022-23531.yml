title: "Relative Path Traversal"
description: "GuardDog is a CLI tool to identify malicious PyPI packages. Versions
  prior to 0.1.5 is vulnerable to Relative Path Traversal when scanning a specially-crafted
  local PyPI package. Running GuardDog against a specially-crafted package can allow
  an attacker to write an arbitrary file on the machine where GuardDog is executed
  due to a path traversal vulnerability when extracting the .tar.gz file of the package
  being scanned, which exists by design in the tarfile.TarFile.extractall function.
  This issue is patched in version 0.1.5."
