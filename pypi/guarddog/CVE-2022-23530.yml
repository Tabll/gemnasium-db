package_slug: "pypi/guarddog"
title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "GuardDog is a CLI tool to identify malicious PyPI packages. Versions
  prior to v0.1.8 is vulnerable to arbitrary file write when scanning a specially-crafted
  remote PyPI package. Extracting files using shutil.unpack_archive() from a potentially
  malicious tarball without validating that the destination file path is within the
  intended destination directory can cause files outside the destination directory
  to be overwritten. This issue is patched in version 0.1.8. Potential workarounds
  include using a safer module, like zipfile, and validating the location of the extracted
  files and discarding those with malicious paths."
