title: "Relative Path Traversal"
description: "Running GuardDog against a specially-crafted package can allow an attacker to 
  write an arbitrary file on the machine where GuardDog is executed. This is due to a path 
  traversal vulnerability when extracting the `.tar.gz` file of the package being scanned, 
  which exists by design in the `tarfile.TarFile.extractall` function. "
