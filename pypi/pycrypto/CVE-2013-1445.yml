identifier: "CVE-2013-1445"
package_slug: "pypi/pycrypto"
title: "Cryptographic Issues"
description: "The `Crypto.Random.atfork` function in PyCrypto does not properly reseed
  the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) before allowing a child process to access
  it, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive information
  by leveraging a race condition in which a child process is created and accesses
  the PRNG within the same rate-limit period as another process."
