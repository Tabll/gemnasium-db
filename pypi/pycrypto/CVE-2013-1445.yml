package_slug: "pypi/pycrypto"
title: "PyCrypto does not properly reseed PRNG before allowing access"
description: "The Crypto.Random.atfork function in PyCrypto before 2.6.1 does not
  properly reseed the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) before allowing a child
  process to access it, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to obtain
  sensitive information by leveraging a race condition in which a child process is
  created and accesses the PRNG within the same rate-limit period as another process."
