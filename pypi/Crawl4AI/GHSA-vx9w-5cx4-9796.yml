title: "Crawl4AI Has Local File Inclusion in Docker API via file:// URLs"
description: "A local file inclusion vulnerability exists in the Crawl4AI Docker API.
  The /execute_js, /screenshot, /pdf, and /html endpoints accept file:// URLs, allowing
  attackers to read arbitrary files from the server filesystem.\n\nAttack Vector:\n```json\nPOST
  /execute_js\n{\n\"url\": \"file:///etc/passwd\",\n\"scripts\": [\"document.body.innerText\"]\n}\n```\nImpact\n\nAn
  unauthenticated attacker can:\n- Read sensitive files (/etc/passwd, /etc/shadow,
  application configs)\n- Access environment variables via /proc/self/environ\n- Discover
  internal application structure\n- Potentially read credentials and API keys\n\nWorkarounds\n\n1.
  Disable the Docker API\n2. Add authentication to the API\n3. Use network-level filtering"
