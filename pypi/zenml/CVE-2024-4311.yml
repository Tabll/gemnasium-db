package_slug: "pypi/zenml"
title: "Missing ratelimit on passwrod resets in zenml"
description: "zenml-io/zenml version 0.56.4 is vulnerable to an account takeover due
  to the lack of rate-limiting in the password change function. An attacker can brute-force
  the current password in the 'Update Password' function, allowing them to take over
  the user's account. This vulnerability is due to the absence of rate-limiting on
  the '/api/v1/current-user' endpoint, which does not restrict the number of attempts
  an attacker can make to guess the current password. Successful exploitation results
  in the attacker being able to change the password and take control of the account."
