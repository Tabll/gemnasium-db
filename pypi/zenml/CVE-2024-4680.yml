package_slug: "pypi/zenml"
title: "zenml-io/zenml does not expire the session after password reset"
description: "A vulnerability in zenml-io/zenml version 0.56.3 allows attackers to
  reuse old session credentials or session IDs due to insufficient session expiration.
  Specifically, the session does not expire after a password change, enabling an attacker
  to maintain access to a compromised account without the victim's ability to revoke
  this access. This issue was observed in a self-hosted ZenML deployment via Docker,
  where after changing the password from one browser, the session remained active
  and usable in another browser without requiring re-authentication."
