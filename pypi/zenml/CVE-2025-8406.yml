title: "ZenML is vulnerable to Path Traversal through its `PathMaterializer` class"
description: "ZenML version 0.83.1 is affected by a path traversal vulnerability in
  the `PathMaterializer` class. The `load` function uses `is_path_within_directory`
  to validate files during `data.tar.gz` extraction, which fails to effectively detect
  symbolic and hard links. This vulnerability can lead to arbitrary file writes, potentially
  resulting in arbitrary command execution if critical files are overwritten."
