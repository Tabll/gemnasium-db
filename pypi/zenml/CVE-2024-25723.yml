title: "ZenML Server Remote Privilege Escalation Vulnerability"
description: "ZenML Server in the ZenML package before 0.46.7 for Python allows remote
  privilege escalation because the `/api/v1/users/{user_name_or_id}/activate` REST
  API endpoint allows access on the basis of a valid username along with a new password
  in the request body. These are also patched versions: 0.44.4, 0.43.1, and 0.42.2."
