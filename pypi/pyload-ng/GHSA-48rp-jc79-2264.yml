title: "pyLoad CNL Blueprint allows Path Traversal through `dlc_path` which leads
  to Remote Code Execution (RCE)"
description: "**Path Traversal in pyLoad-ng CNL Blueprint via `package` parameter
  allows Arbitrary File Write leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE)** The `addcrypted`
  endpoint in `pyload-ng` suffers from an unsafe path construction vulnerability,
  allowing unauthenticated attackers to write arbitrary files outside the designated
  storage directory. This can be abused to overwrite critical system files, including
  cron jobs and systemd services, leading to privilege escalation and remote code
  execution as root."
