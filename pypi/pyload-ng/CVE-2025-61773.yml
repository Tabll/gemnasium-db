title: "pyLoad CNL and captcha handlers allow Code Injection via unsanitized parameters"
description: "pyLoad web interface contained insufficient input validation in both
  the Captcha script endpoint and the Click'N'Load (CNL) Blueprint. This flaw allowed
  untrusted user input to be processed unsafely, which could be exploited by an attacker
  to inject arbitrary content into the web UI or manipulate request handling. The
  vulnerability could lead to client-side code execution (XSS) or other unintended
  behaviors when a malicious payload is submitted.\n\nuser-supplied parameters from
  HTTP requests were not adequately validated or sanitized before being passed into
  the application logic and response generation. This allowed crafted input to alter
  the expected execution flow.\nCNL (Click'N'Load) blueprint exposed unsafe handling
  of untrusted parameters in HTTP requests. The application did not consistently enforce
  input validation or encoding, making it possible for an attacker to craft malicious
  requests."
