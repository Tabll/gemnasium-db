package_slug: "pypi/pyload-ng"
title: "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
description: "pyLoad is a free and open-source Download Manager written in pure Python.
  The `pyload` API allows any API call to be made using GET requests. Since the session
  cookie is not set to `SameSite: strict`, this opens the library up to severe attack
  possibilities via a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack. As a result any API
  call can be made via a CSRF attack by an unauthenticated user. This issue has been
  addressed in release `0.5.0b3.dev78`. All users are advised to upgrade."
