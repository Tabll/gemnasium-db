package_slug: "pypi/pyload-ng"
title: "Cross-Site Request Forgery on any API call in pyLoad may lead to admin privilege
  escalation"
description: "The `pyload` API allows any API call to be made using GET requests.
  Since the session cookie is not set to `SameSite: strict`, this opens the library
  up to severe attack possibilities via a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack.
  This proof of concept shows how an unauthenticated user could trick the administrator's
  browser into creating a new admin user."
