package_slug: "pypi/pypdf"
title: "Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')"
description: "pypdf is a free and open-source pure-python PDF library. An attacker
  who uses a vulnerability present in versions 3.7.0 through 3.16.4 can craft a PDF
  which leads to an infinite loop. This infinite loop blocks the current process and
  can utilize a single core of the CPU by 100%. It does not affect memory usage. That
  is, for example, the case when the pypdf-user manipulates an incoming malicious
  PDF e.g. by merging it with another PDF or by adding annotations. The issue was
  fixed in version 3.17.0. As a workaround, apply the patch manually by modifying
  `pypdf/generic/_data_structures.py`."
