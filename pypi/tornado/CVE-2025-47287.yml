- "GHSA-7cx3-6m66-7c5m"
package_slug: "pypi/tornado"
title: "Tornado vulnerable to excessive logging caused by malformed multipart form
  data"
description: "When Tornado's ``multipart/form-data`` parser encounters certain errors,
  it logs a warning but continues trying to parse the remainder of the data. This
  allows remote attackers to generate an extremely high volume of logs, constituting
  a DoS attack. This DoS is compounded by the fact that the logging subsystem is synchronous."
