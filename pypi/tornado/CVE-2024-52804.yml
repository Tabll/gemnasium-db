title: "Tornado has an HTTP cookie parsing DoS vulnerability"
description: "The algorithm used for parsing HTTP cookies in Tornado versions prior
  to 6.4.2 sometimes has quadratic complexity, leading to excessive CPU consumption
  when parsing maliciously-crafted cookie headers. This parsing occurs in the event
  loop thread and may block the processing of other requests.\n\nSee also CVE-2024-7592
  for a similar vulnerability in cpython."
