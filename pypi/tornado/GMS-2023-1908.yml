title: "Tornado vulnerable to HTTP request smuggling via improper parsing of `Content-Length`
  fields and chunk lengths"
description: "## Summary\nTornado interprets `-`, `+`, and `_` in chunk length and
  `Content-Length` values, which are not allowed by the HTTP RFCs. This can result
  in request smuggling when Tornado is deployed behind certain proxies that interpret
  those non-standard characters differently. This is known to apply to older versions
  of haproxy, although the current release is not affected.\n\n## Details\nTornado
  uses the `int` constructor to parse the values of `Content-Length` headers and chunk
  lengths in the following locations:\n### `tornado/http1connection.py:445`\n```python3\n
  \     self._expected_content_remaining = int(headers[\"Content-Length\"])\n```\n###
  `tornado/http1connection.py:621`\n```python3\n        content_length = int(headers[\"Content-Length\"])
  # type: Optional[int]\n```\n### `tornado/http1connection.py:671`\n```python3\n      chunk_len
  = int(chunk_len_str.strip(), 16)\n```\nBecause `int(\"0_0\") == int(\"+0\") == int(\"-0\")
  == int(\"0\")`, using the `int` constructor to parse and validate strings that should
  contain only ASCII digits is not a good strategy. \n\n"
