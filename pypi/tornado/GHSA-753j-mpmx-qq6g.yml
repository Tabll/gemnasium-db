title: "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')
  in tornado"
description: "When Tornado receives a request with two `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`
  headers, it ignores them both. This enables request smuggling when Tornado is deployed
  behind a proxy server that emits such requests. [Pound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(networking))
  does this."
