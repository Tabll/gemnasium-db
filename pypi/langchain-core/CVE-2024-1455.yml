title: "LangChain's XMLOutputParser vulnerable to XML Entity Expansion"
description: "The XMLOutputParser in LangChain uses the etree module from the XML
  parser in the standard python library which has some XML vulnerabilities; see: https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.html\n\nThis
  primarily affects users that combine an LLM (or agent) with the `XMLOutputParser`
  and expose the component via an endpoint on a web-service.\n\nThis would allow a
  malicious party to attempt to manipulate the LLM to produce a malicious payload
  for the parser that would compromise the availability of the service.\n\nA successful
  attack is predicated on:\n\n1. Usage of XMLOutputParser\n2. Passing of malicious
  input into the XMLOutputParser either directly or by trying to manipulate an LLM
  to do so on the users behalf\n3. Exposing the component via a web-service"
