title: "LangChain serialization injection vulnerability enables secret extraction
  in dumps/loads APIs"
description: "A serialization injection vulnerability exists in LangChain's `dumps()`
  and `dumpd()` functions. The functions do not escape dictionaries with `'lc'` keys
  when serializing free-form dictionaries. The `'lc'` key is used internally by LangChain
  to mark serialized objects. When user-controlled data contains this key structure,
  it is treated as a legitimate LangChain object during deserialization rather than
  plain user data."
