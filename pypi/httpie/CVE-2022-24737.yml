package_slug: "pypi/httpie"
title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "HTTPie is a command-line HTTP client. HTTPie has the practical concept
  of sessions, which help users to persistently store some of the state that belongs
  to the outgoing requests and incoming responses on the disk for further usage. Before
  3.1.0, HTTPie didn't distinguish between cookies and hosts they belonged. This behavior
  resulted in the exposure of some cookies when there are redirects originating from
  the actual host to a third party website. Users are advised to upgrade. There are
  no known workarounds."
