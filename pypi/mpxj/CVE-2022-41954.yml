package_slug: "pypi/mpxj"
title: "Temporary File Information Disclosure vulnerability in MPXJ"
description: "On Unix-like operating systems (not Windows or macos), MPXJ's use of
  `File.createTempFile(..)` results in temporary files being created with the permissions
  `-rw-r--r--`. This means that any other user on the system can read the contents
  of this file. When MPXJ is reading a type of schedule file which requires the creation
  of a temporary file or directory, a knowledgeable local user could locate these
  transient files while they are in use and would then be able to read the schedule
  being processed by MPXJ."
