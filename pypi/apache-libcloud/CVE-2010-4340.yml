title: "Apache Libcloud does not verify SSL certificates for HTTPS connections"
description: "libcloud before 0.4.0 does not verify SSL certificates for HTTPS connections,
  which allows remote attackers to spoof certificates and bypass intended access restrictions
  via a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. This is due to an upstream issue with python's
  SSL module rather than directly with libcloud."
