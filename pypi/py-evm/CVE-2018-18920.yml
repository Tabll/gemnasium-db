title: "Py-EVM is vulnerable to arbitrary bytecode injection"
description: "Py-EVM v0.2.0-alpha.33 allows attackers to make a vm.execute_bytecode
  call that triggers computation._stack.values with '\"stack\": [100, 100, 0]' where
  b'\\x' was expected, resulting in an execution failure because of an invalid opcode.
  This is reportedly related to \"smart contracts can be executed indefinitely without
  gas being paid.\""
