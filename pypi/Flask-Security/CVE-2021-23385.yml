package_slug: "pypi/Flask-Security"
title: "URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')"
description: "This affects all versions of package Flask-Security. When using the
  get_post_logout_redirect and get_post_login_redirect functions, it is possible to
  bypass URL validation and redirect a user to an arbitrary URL by providing multiple
  back slashes such as \\\\\\evil.com/path. This vulnerability is only exploitable
  if an alternative WSGI server other than Werkzeug is used, or the default behaviour
  of Werkzeug is modified using 'autocorrect_location_header=False. **Note:** Flask-Security
  is not maintained anymore."
