package_slug: "pypi/picklescan"
title: "Zip Flag Bit Exploit Crashes Picklescan But Not PyTorch"
description: "PickleScan fails to detect malicious pickle files inside PyTorch model
  archives when certain ZIP file flag bits are modified. By flipping specific bits
  in the ZIP file headers, an attacker can embed malicious pickle files that remain
  undetected by PickleScan while still being successfully loaded by PyTorch's torch.load().
  This can lead to arbitrary code execution when loading a compromised model."
