title: "PyTorch Model Files Can Bypass Pickle Scanners via Unexpected Pickle Extensions"
description: "Picklescan fails to detect hidden pickle files embedded in PyTorch model
  archives due to its reliance on file extensions for detection. This allows an attacker
  to embed a secondary, malicious pickle file with a non-standard extension inside
  a model archive, which remains undetected by picklescan but is still loaded by PyTorch's
  torch.load() function. This can lead to arbitrary code execution when the model
  is loaded."
