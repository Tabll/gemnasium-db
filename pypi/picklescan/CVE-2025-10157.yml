title: "Picklescan is Vulnerable to Unsafe Globals Check Bypass through Subclass Imports"
description: "The vulnerability allows malicious actors to bypass PickleScan's unsafe
  globals check, leading to potential arbitrary code execution. The issue stems from
  PickleScan's strict check for full module names against its list of unsafe globals.
  By using subclasses of dangerous imports instead of the exact module names, attackers
  can circumvent the check and inject malicious payloads."
