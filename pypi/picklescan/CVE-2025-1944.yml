package_slug: "pypi/picklescan"
title: "Zip Exploit Crashes Picklescan But Not PyTorch "
description: "PickleScan is vulnerable to a ZIP archive manipulation attack that causes
  it to crash when attempting to extract and scan PyTorch model archives. By modifying
  the filename in the ZIP header while keeping the original filename in the directory
  listing, an attacker can make PickleScan raise a BadZipFile error. However, PyTorch's
  more forgiving ZIP implementation still allows the model to be loaded, enabling
  malicious payloads to bypass detection."
