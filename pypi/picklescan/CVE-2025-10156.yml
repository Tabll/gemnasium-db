title: "Picklescan: ZIP archive scan bypass is possible through non-exhaustive Cyclic
  Redundancy Check"
description: "Picklescan's ability to scan ZIP archives for malicious pickle files
  is compromised when the archive contains a file with a bad Cyclic Redundancy Check
  (CRC). Instead of attempting to scan the files within the archive, whatever the
  CRC is, Picklescan fails in error and returns no results. This allows attackers
  to potentially hide malicious pickle payloads within ZIP archives that PyTorch might
  still be able to load (as PyTorch often disables CRC checks)."
