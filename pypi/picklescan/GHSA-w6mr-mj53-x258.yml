title: "Duplicate Advisory: Zip Exploit Crashes Picklescan But Not PyTorch "
description: "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-7q5r-7gvp-wc82. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n## Original Description\npicklescan before 0.0.23 is vulnerable to
  a ZIP archive manipulation attack that causes it to crash when attempting to extract
  and scan PyTorch model archives. By modifying the filename in the ZIP header while
  keeping the original filename in the directory listing, an attacker can make PickleScan
  raise a BadZipFile error. However, PyTorch's more forgiving ZIP implementation still
  allows the model to be loaded, enabling malicious payloads to bypass detection."
