title: "Picklescan Bypasses Unsafe Globals Check using pty.spawn"
description: "The vulnerability allows malicious actors to bypass PickleScan's unsafe
  globals check, leading to potential arbitrary code execution. The issue stems from
  the absence of the `pty` library (more specifically, of  the `pty.spawn` function)
  from PickleScan's list of unsafe globals. This vulnerability allows attackers to
  disguise malicious pickle payloads within files that would otherwise be scanned
  for pickle-based threats."
