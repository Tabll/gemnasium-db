title: "Duplicate Advisory: Picklescan Vulnerable to Exfiltration via DNS via linecache
  and ssl.get_server_certificate"
description: "# Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-93mv-x874-956g. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n# Original Description\n\nThe unsafe globals in Picklescan before
  0.0.25 do not include ssl. Consequently, ssl.get_server_certificate can exfiltrate
  data via DNS after deserialization."
