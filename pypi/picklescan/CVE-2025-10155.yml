package_slug: "pypi/picklescan"
title: "Picklescan Bypass is Possible via File Extension Mismatch"
description: "Picklescan can be bypassed, allowing the detection of malicious pickle
  files to fail, when a standard pickle file is given a PyTorch-related file extension
  (e.g., .bin). This occurs because the scanner prioritizes PyTorch file extension
  checks and errors out when parsing a standard pickle file with such an extension
  instead of falling back to standard pickle analysis. This vulnerability allows attackers
  to disguise malicious pickle payloads within files that would otherwise be scanned
  for pickle-based threats."
