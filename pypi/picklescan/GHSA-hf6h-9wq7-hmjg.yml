title: "Duplicate Advisory: Picklescan is Vulnerable to Unsafe Globals Check Bypass
  through Subclass Imports"
description: "### Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it
  is a duplicate of GHSA-f7qq-56ww-84cr. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n### Original Description\nA Protection Mechanism Failure vulnerability
  in mmaitre314 picklescan versions up to and including 0.0.30 allows a remote attacker
  to bypass the unsafe globals check. This is possible because the scanner performs
  an exact match for module names, allowing malicious payloads to be loaded via submodules
  of dangerous packages (e.g., 'asyncio.unix_events' instead of 'asyncio'). \n\nWhen
  the incorrectly considered safe file is loaded after scan, it can lead to the execution
  of malicious code."
