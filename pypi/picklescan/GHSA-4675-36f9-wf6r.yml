title: "Picklescan does not block ctypes"
description: "Picklescan doesnt flag ctypes module as a dangerous module, which is
  a huge issue. ctypes is basically a foreign function interface library and can be
  used to\n* Load DLLs\n* Call C functions directly\n* Manipulate memory raw pointers.\n\nThis
  can allow attackers to achieve RCE by invoking direct syscalls without going through
  blocked modules. Another major issue that ctypes being allowed presents is that
  it can be used down the line to dismantle interpreter based python sandboxes as
  ctypes allow direct access to raw memory.\n\nThis is a more severe loophole than
  normal gadget chains and bypasses as raw memory access can be used for a lot of
  nefarious purposes down the line if left undetected"
