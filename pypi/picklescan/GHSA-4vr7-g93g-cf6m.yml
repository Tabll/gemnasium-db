title: "Duplicate Advisory: Picklescan: ZIP archive scan bypass is possible through
  non-exhaustive Cyclic Redundancy Check"
description: "### Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it
  is a duplicate of GHSA-m4j5-5x4r-2xp9. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n### Original Description\nAn Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions
  vulnerability in the ZIP archive scanning component of mmaitre314 picklescan allows
  a remote attacker to bypass security scans. This is achieved by crafting a ZIP archive
  containing a file with a bad Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC), which causes the scanner
  to halt and fail to analyze the contents for malicious pickle files.Â When the file
  incorrectly considered safe is loaded, it can lead to the execution of malicious
  code."
