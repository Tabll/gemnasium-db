title: "Picklescan failed to detect to some unsafe global function in Numpy library"
description: "An unsafe deserialization vulnerability in Pythonâ€™s pickle module allows
  an attacker to bypass static analysis tools like Picklescan and execute arbitrary
  code during deserialization. This can be exploited by import some built-in function
  in Numpy library that indrectly call some dangerous function like exec() to execute
  some python code as a parameter, which the attacker can import dangerous library
  inside like os library and execute arbitrary OS commands."
