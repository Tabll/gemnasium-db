title: "uv has differential in tar extraction with PAX headers"
description: "In versions 0.9.4 and earlier of uv, tar archives containing PAX headers
  with file size overrides were not handled properly. As a result, an attacker could
  contrive a source distribution (as a tar archive) that would extract differently
  when installed via uv versus other Python package installers.\n\nThe underlying
  parsing differential here originates with astral-tokio-tar, which disclosed this
  vulnerability as CVE-2025-62518.\n\nIn practice, the impact of this vulnerability
  is **low**: only source distributions can be formatted as tar archives, and source
  distributions execute arbitrary code at build/installation time by definition. Consequently,
  a parser differential in tar extraction is strictly less powerful than the capabilities
  already exposed to an attacker who has the ability to control source distributions.\n\nHowever,
  this particular source of malleability in source distributions is unintentional
  and not operating by design, and therefore we consider it a vulnerability despite
  its overlap in capabilities with intended behavior."
