title: "Django-Unicorn Class Pollution Vulnerability, Leading to XSS, DoS and Authentication
  Bypass"
description: "Django-Unicorn is vulnerable to python class pollution vulnerability,
  a new type of vulnerability categorized under [CWE-915](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/915.html).
  The vulnerability arises from the core functionality `set_property_value`, which
  can be remotely triggered by users by crafting appropriate component requests and
  feeding in values of second and third parameter to the vulnerable function, leading
  to arbitrary changes to the python runtime status.\n\nWith this finding, so far
  we've found at least five ways of vulnerability exploitation, stably resulting in
  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Denial of Service (DoS), and Authentication Bypass attacks
  in almost every Django-Unicorn-based application."
