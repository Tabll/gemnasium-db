description: "### Path Traversal Vulnerability in InvokeAI\n\nA path traversal vulnerability
  in **InvokeAI** (versions < 6.7.0) allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to
  read files outside the intended media directory via the **bulk downloads** API.\n\nThe
  endpoint accepts a user-controlled file/item name and concatenates it into a filesystem
  path without proper canonicalization or allow-listing. By supplying sequences such
  as `../` (or absolute paths), an attacker can cause the server to traverse directories
  and return arbitrary files.\n\nIn certain storage or back-end configurations, abusing
  attacker-controlled paths can also lead to unintended overwriting or deletion of
  files referenced by the crafted path.\n\nThe issue is fixed in **6.7.0**, which
  normalizes and validates input paths and rejects traversal attempts.\n\n**Affected
  versions:** `< 6.7.0`\n**Patched version:** `6.7.0`"
