package_slug: "pypi/whoogle-search"
title: "Whoogle Search Path Traversal vulnerability"
description: "Whoogle Search is a self-hosted metasearch engine. In versions prior
  to 0.8.4, the `element` method in `app/routes.py` does not validate the user-controlled
  `src_type` and `element_url` variables and passes them to the `send` method which
  sends a GET request on lines 339-343 in `request.py`, which leads to a server-side
  request forgery. This issue allows for crafting GET requests to internal and external
  resources on behalf of the server. For example, this issue would allow for accessing
  resources on the internal network that the server has access to, even though these
  resources may not be accessible on the internet. This issue is fixed in version
  0.8.4."
