title: "Whoogle Search Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability"
description: "Whoogle Search is a self-hosted metasearch engine. In versions 0.8.3
  and prior, the `window` endpoint does not sanitize user-supplied input from the
  `location` variable and passes it to the `send` method which sends a `GET` request
  on lines 339-343 in `request.py,` which leads to a server-side request forgery.
  This issue allows for crafting GET requests to internal and external resources on
  behalf of the server. For example, this issue would allow for accessing resources
  on the internal network that the server has access to, even though these resources
  may not be accessible on the internet. This issue is fixed in version 0.8.4.\n\n"
