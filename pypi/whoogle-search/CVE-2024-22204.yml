package_slug: "pypi/whoogle-search"
title: "Whoogle Search Path Traversal vulnerability"
description: "Whoogle Search is a self-hosted metasearch engine. Versions 0.8.3 and
  prior have a limited file write vulnerability when the configuration options in
  Whoogle are enabled. The `config` function in `app/routes.py` does not validate
  the user-controlled `name` variable on line 447 and `config_data` variable on line
  437. The `name` variable is insecurely concatenated in `os.path.join`, leading to
  path manipulation. The POST data from the `config_data` variable is saved with `pickle.dump`
  which leads to a limited file write. However, the data that is saved is earlier
  transformed into a dictionary and the `url` key value pair is added before the file
  is saved on the system. All in all, the issue allows us to save and overwrite files
  on the system that the application has permissions to, with a dictionary containing
  arbitrary data and the `url` key value, which is a limited file write. Version 0.8.4
  contains a patch for this issue."
