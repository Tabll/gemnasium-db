title: "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature in django-rest-registration"
description: "The vulnerability is a high severity one. Anyone using Django REST Registration
  library versions `0.2.*` - `0.4.*` with e-mail verification option (which is recommended,
  but needs [additional configuration](https://django-rest-registration.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html#preferred-configuration))
  is affected.\nIn the worst case, the attacker can take over any Django user by resetting
  his/her password without even receiving the reset password verification link, just
  by guessing the signature from publicly available data (more detailed description
  below)."
