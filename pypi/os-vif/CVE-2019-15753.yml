title: "OpenStack os-vif Ageing time of 0 disables linuxbridge MAC learning"
description: "In OpenStack os-vif 1.15.x before 1.15.2, and 1.16.0, a hard-coded MAC
  aging time of 0 disables MAC learning in linuxbridge, forcing obligatory Ethernet
  flooding of non-local destinations, which both impedes network performance and allows
  users to possibly view the content of packets for instances belonging to other tenants
  sharing the same network. Only deployments using the linuxbridge backend are affected.
  This occurs in PyRoute2.add() in `internal/command/ip/linux/impl_pyroute2.py`."
