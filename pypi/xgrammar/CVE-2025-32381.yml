package_slug: "pypi/xgrammar"
title: "xgrammar Vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) by abusing unbounded cache
  in memory"
description: "Xgrammar includes a cache for compiled grammars to increase performance
  with repeated use of the same grammar. This cache is held in memory. Since the cache
  is unbounded, a system making use of xgrammar can be abused to fill up a host's
  memory and case a denial of service. For example, sending many small requests to
  an LLM inference server with unique JSON schemas would eventually cause this denial
  of service to occur."
