package_slug: "pypi/vantage6"
title: "vantage6 vulnerable to Observable Response Discrepancy"
description: "### Impact\nWe are incorporating the password policies listed in https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/59.
  One measure is that we don't let the user know in case of wrong username/password
  combination if the username actually exists, to prevent that bots can guess usernames.
  However, if a wrong password is entered a number of times, the user account is blocked
  temporarily. This way you could still find out which usernames exist.\n\n### Patches\nUpdate
  to 3.8.0+\n\n### Workarounds\nNo\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/59\n\n###
