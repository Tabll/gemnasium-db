title: "vantage6 refresh tokens do not expire"
description: "From issue: \n\nProblem description\nCurrently, the refresh token is
  valid indefinitely. This is bad security practice.\n\nDesired solution\nThe refresh
  token should get a validity of 24-48 hours.\n\nAdditional context\n\nWhen implementing
  this, also check that the refresh token returns a new refresh token\nWhen implementing
  this, also adapt the UI so that it logs out if refresh token is no longer valid.\nWhen
  implementing this, ensure that nodes refresh their token periodically so that they
  do not have to be restarted manually.\n\n\n### Impact\n### Patches\nNone available
  \n\n### Workarounds\nNone available\n\n"
