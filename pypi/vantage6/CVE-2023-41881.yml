package_slug: "pypi/vantage6"
title: "Incorrect Ownership Assignment"
description: "vantage6 is privacy preserving federated learning infrastructure. When
  a collaboration is deleted, the linked resources (such as tasks from that collaboration)
  should be deleted. This is partly to manage data properly, but also to prevent a
  potential (but unlikely) side-effect that affects versions prior to 4.0.0, where
  if a collaboration with id=10 is deleted, and subsequently a new collaboration is
  created with id=10, the authenticated users in that collaboration could potentially
  see results of the deleted collaboration in some cases. Version 4.0.0 contains a
  patch for this issue. There are no known workarounds."
