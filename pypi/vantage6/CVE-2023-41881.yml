title: "vantage6 does not properly delete linked resources when deleting a collaboration"
description: "When a collaboration is deleted in vantage6, the linked resources (such
  as tasks from that collaboration) are not properly deleted.\n\nThis is partly to
  manage data properly, but also to prevent a potential (but unlikely) side-effect,
  where if a collaboration with id=10 is deleted, and subsequently a new collaboration
  is created with id=10, the authenticated users in that collaboration could potentially
  see results of the deleted collaboration in some cases, resulting in information
  disclosure."
