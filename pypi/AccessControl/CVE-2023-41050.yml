package_slug: "pypi/AccessControl"
title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "AccessControl provides a general security framework for use in Zope.
  Python's \"format\" functionality allows someone controlling the format string to
  \"read\" objects accessible (recursively) via attribute access and subscription
  from accessible objects. Those attribute accesses and subscriptions use Python's
  full blown `getattr` and `getitem`, not the policy restricted `AccessControl` variants
  `_getattr_` and `_getitem_`. This can lead to critical information disclosure. `AccessControl`
  already provides a safe variant for `str.format` and denies access to `string.Formatter`.
  However, `str.format_map` is still unsafe. Affected are all users who allow untrusted
  users to create `AccessControl` controlled Python code and execute it. A fix has
  been introduced in versions 4.4, 5.8 and 6.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There
  are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
