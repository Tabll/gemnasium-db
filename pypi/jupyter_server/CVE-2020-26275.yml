identifier: "CVE-2020-26275"
package_slug: "pypi/jupyter_server"
title: "URL Redirection to Untrusted Site (Open Redirect)"
description: "The Jupyter Server provides the backend (`i.e.` the core services, APIs,
  and REST endpoints) for Jupyter web applications like Jupyter notebook, JupyterLab,
  and Voila. In Jupyter Server an open redirect vulnerability could cause the jupyter
  server to redirect the browser to a different malicious website. All jupyter servers
  running without a `base_url` prefix are technically affected, however, these maliciously
  crafted links can only be reasonably made for known jupyter server hosts. A link
  to your jupyter server may *appear* safe, but ultimately redirect to a spoofed server
  on the public internet."
