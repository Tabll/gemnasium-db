title: "OpenStack Ironic fails to restrict paths used for file:// image URLs"
description: "OpenStack Ironic before 29.0.1 can write unintended files to a target
  node disk during image handling (if a deployment was performed via the API). A malicious
  project assigned as a node owner can provide a path to any local file (readable
  by ironic-conductor), which may then be written to the target node disk. This is
  difficult to exploit in practice, because a node deployed in this manner should
  never reach the ACTIVE state, but it still represents a danger in environments running
  with non-default, insecure configurations such as with automated cleaning disabled.
  The fixed versions are 24.1.3, 26.1.1, and 29.0.1."
