title: "PostQuantum-Feldman-VSS'S Dependency Vulnerability in gmpy2 Leading to Interpreter
  Crash"
description: "**Description:**\n\nPostQuantum-Feldman-VSS, a Python library implementing
  Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing scheme with post-quantum security, was vulnerable
  to denial-of-service attacks in versions up to and including 0.7.6b0.  This vulnerability
  stems from the library's reliance on the `gmpy2` library for arbitrary-precision
  arithmetic.  `gmpy2`, in turn, depends on the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic
  Library (GMP). GMP, by design, terminates the process when it cannot allocate memory.
  \ An attacker could exploit this by providing carefully crafted inputs that cause
  `gmpy2` to attempt to allocate extremely large amounts of memory, leading to a crash
  of the Python interpreter and thus a denial of service.\n\n**Vulnerability Details:**\n\nThe
  core issue lies in the behavior of GMP (and thus, `gmpy2`) when memory allocation
  fails.  Instead of raising a standard Python exception that could be caught and
  handled, GMP terminates the entire process. This behavior is documented in the GMP
  and gmpy2 documentation:"
