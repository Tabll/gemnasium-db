description: "The Python client library for Glance (python-glanceclient) does not
  properly check the preverify_ok value, which prevents the server hostname from being
  verified with a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName
  field of the X.509 certificate and allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL
  servers via an arbitrary valid certificate."
