title: "Rebuild-bot workflow may allow unauthorised repository modifications"
description: "`projen` is a project generation tool that synthesizes project configuration
  files such as `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `.gitignore`, GitHub Workflows, `eslint`,
  `jest`, and more, from a well-typed definition written in JavaScript. Users of projen's
  `NodeProject` project type (including any project type derived from it) include
  a `.github/workflows/rebuild-bot.yml` workflow that may allow any GitHub user to
  trigger execution of un-trusted code in the context of the \"main\" repository (as
  opposed to that of a fork). In some situations, such untrusted code may potentially
  be able to commit to the \"main\" repository.\n\nThe rebuild-bot workflow is triggered
  by comments including `@projen rebuild` on pull-request to trigger a re-build of
  the projen project, and updating the pull request with the updated files. This workflow
  is triggered by an `issue_comment` event, and thus always executes with a `GITHUB_TOKEN`
  belonging to the repository into which the pull-request is made (this is in contrast
  with workflows triggered by `pull_request` events, which always execute with a `GITHUB_TOKEN`
  belonging to the repository from which the pull-request is made).\n\nRepositories
  that do not have branch protection configured on their default branch (typically
  `main` or `master`) could possibly allow an untrusted user to gain access to secrets
  configured on the repository (such as NPM tokens, etc). Branch protection prohibits
  this escalation, as the managed `GITHUB_TOKEN` would not be able to modify the contents
  of a protected branch and affected workflows must be defined on the default branch."
