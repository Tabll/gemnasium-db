title: "datasette-graphql leaks details of the schema of private database files"
description: "### Impact\n\nWhen running against a Datasette instance with private
  databases, `datasette-graphql` would expose the schema of those database tables
  - but not the table contents.\n\n### Patches\n\nPatched \n\n### Workarounds\n\nThis
  issue is only present if a Datasette instance that includes private databases and
  has the `datasette-graphql` plugin installed is available on the public internet.
  Uninstalling the `datasette-graphql` plugin or preventing public access to the instance
  can workaround this issue.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions
  or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [datasette-graphql](https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql)\n*
