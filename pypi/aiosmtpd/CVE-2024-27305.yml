package_slug: "pypi/aiosmtpd"
title: "aiosmtpd vulnerable to SMTP smuggling"
description: "### Summary\naiosmtpd is vulnerable to inbound SMTP smuggling. SMTP
  smuggling is a novel vulnerability based on not so novel interpretation differences
  of the SMTP protocol. By exploiting SMTP smuggling, an attacker may send smuggle/spoof
  e-mails with fake sender addresses, allowing advanced phishing attacks. This issue
  also existed in other SMTP software like Postfix (https://www.postfix.org/smtp-smuggling.html).\n\n###
  Details\nDetailed information on SMTP smuggling can be found in the full blog post
  (https://sec-consult.com/blog/detail/smtp-smuggling-spoofing-e-mails-worldwide/)
  or on the Postfix homepage (https://www.postfix.org/smtp-smuggling.html). (and soon
  on the official website https://smtpsmuggling.com/)  \n\n### Impact\nWith the right
  SMTP server constellation, an attacker can send spoofed e-mails to inbound/receiving
  aiosmtpd instances."
