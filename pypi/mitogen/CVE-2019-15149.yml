package_slug: "pypi/mitogen"
title: "Undirectional routing wasn't respected in some cases in Mitogen"
description: "core.py in Mitogen before 0.2.8 has a typo that drops the unidirectional-routing
  protection mechanism in the case of a child that is initiated by another child.
  The Ansible extension is unaffected. NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue because
  it is exploitable only in conjunction with hypothetical other factors, i.e., an
  affected use case within a library caller, and a bug in the message receiver policy
  code that led to reliance on this extra protection mechanism."
