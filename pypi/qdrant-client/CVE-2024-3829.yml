title: "qdrant input validation failure "
description: "qdrant/qdrant version 1.9.0-dev is vulnerable to arbitrary file read
  and write during the snapshot recovery process. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability
  by manipulating snapshot files to include symlinks, leading to arbitrary file read
  by adding a symlink that points to a desired file on the filesystem and arbitrary
  file write by including a symlink and a payload file in the snapshot's directory
  structure. This vulnerability allows for the reading and writing of arbitrary files
  on the server, which could potentially lead to a full takeover of the system. The
  issue is fixed in version v1.9.0."
