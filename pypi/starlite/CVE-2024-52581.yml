title: "Litestar allows unbounded resource consumption (DoS vulnerability) "
description: "Litestar offers multiple methods to return a parsed representation of
  the request body, as well as extractors that rely on those parsers to map request
  content to structured data types. Multiple of those parsers do not have size limits
  when reading the request body into memory, which allows an attacker to cause excessive
  memory consumption on the server by sending large requests."
