package_slug: "pypi/starlite"
title: "Improper Neutralization"
description: "Starlite is an Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI) framework.
  Prior to version 1.5.2, the request body parsing in `starlite` allows a potentially
  unauthenticated attacker to consume a large amount of CPU time and RAM. The multipart
  body parser processes an unlimited number of file parts and an unlimited number
  of field parts. This is a remote, potentially unauthenticated Denial of Service
  vulnerability. This vulnerability affects applications with a request handler that
  accepts a `Body(media_type=RequestEncodingType.MULTI_PART)`. The large amount of
  CPU time required for processing requests can block all available worker processes
  and significantly delay or slow down the processing of legitimate user requests.
  The large amount of RAM accumulated while processing requests can lead to Out-Of-Memory
  kills. Complete DoS is achievable by sending many concurrent multipart requests
  in a loop. Version 1.51.2 contains a patch for this issue."
