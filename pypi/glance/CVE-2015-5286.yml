package_slug: "pypi/glance"
title: "OpenStack Image Service (Glance) allows remote authenticated users to bypass
  storage quota, cause denial of service"
description: "A race-condition flaw was discovered in the OpenStack Image service
  (glance). When images in the upload state were deleted using a token close to expiration,
  untracked image data could accumulate in the back end. Because untracked data does
  not count towards the storage quota, an attacker could use this flaw to cause a
  denial of service through resource exhaustion."
