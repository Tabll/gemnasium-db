package_slug: "pypi/glance"
title: "OpenStack Glance Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
description: "An SSRF issue was discovered in OpenStack Glance before Newton. The
  'copy_from' feature in the Image Service API v1 allowed an attacker to perform masked
  network port scans. With v1, it is possible to create images with a URL such as
  'http://localhost:22'. This could then allow an attacker to enumerate internal network
  details while appearing masked, since the scan would appear to originate from the
  Glance Image service."
