package_slug: "pypi/glance"
title: "OpenStack Image Service (Glance) allows remote authenticated users to bypass
  access restrictions"
description: "A flaw was discovered in the OpenStack Image service (glance) where
  a tenant could manipulate the status of their images by submitting an HTTP PUT request
  together with an 'x-image-meta-status' header. A malicious tenant could exploit
  this flaw to reactivate disabled images, bypass storage quotas, and in some cases
  replace image contents (where they have owner access). Setups using the Image service's
  v1 API could allow the illegal modification of image status. Additionally, setups
  which also use the v2 API could allow a subsequent re-upload of image contents."
