title: "Improper Access Control"
description: "An authorization vulnerability in OpenStack Image service was discovered,
  which allowed image-status manipulation using locations. By removing the last location
  of an image, an authenticated user could change the status from 'active' to 'queue'.
  A malicious tenant could exploit this flaw to silently replace owned image data,
  regardless of its original creator or visibility settings. Only environments with
  show_multiple_locations set to true (not default) were affected."
