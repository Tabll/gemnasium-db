title: "Aim vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery"
description: "aimhubio/aim version 3.22.0 contains a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  vulnerability in the tracking server. The vulnerability is due to overly permissive
  CORS settings, allowing cross-origin requests from all origins. This enables CSRF
  attacks on all endpoints of the tracking server, which can be chained with other
  existing vulnerabilities such as remote code execution, denial of service, and arbitrary
  file read/write."
