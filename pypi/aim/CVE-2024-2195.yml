title: "Aim Web API vulnerable to Remote Code Execution"
description: "A critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability was identified
  in the aimhubio/aim project, specifically within the `/api/runs/search/run/` endpoint,
  affecting versions >= 3.0.0. The vulnerability resides in the `run_search_api` function
  of the `aim/web/api/runs/views.py` file, where improper restriction of user access
  to the `RunView` object allows for the execution of arbitrary code via the `query`
  parameter. This issue enables attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the server,
  potentially leading to full system compromise."
