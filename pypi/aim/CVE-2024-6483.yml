title: "Aim Relative Path Traversal vulnerability"
description: "A vulnerability in the `runs/delete-batch` endpoint of aimhubio/aim
  version 3.19.3 allows for arbitrary file or directory deletion through path traversal.
  The endpoint does not mitigate path traversal when handling user-specified run-names,
  which are used to specify log/metadata files for deletion. This can be exploited
  to delete arbitrary files or directories, potentially causing denial of service
  or data loss."
