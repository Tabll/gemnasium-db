title: "Aim vulnerable to Synchronous Access of Remote Resource without Timeout"
description: "A vulnerability in aimhubio/aim version 3.25.0 allows for a denial of
  service through the misuse of the sshfs-client. The tracking server, which is single-threaded,
  can be made unresponsive by requesting it to connect to an unresponsive socket via
  sshfs. The lack of an additional timeout setting in the sshfs-client causes the
  server to hang for a significant amount of time, preventing it from responding to
  other requests."
