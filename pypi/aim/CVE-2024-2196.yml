title: "Aim Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerability allows user to delete runs and
  perform other operations"
description: "aimhubio/aim is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), allowing
  attackers to perform actions such as deleting runs, updating data, and stealing
  data like log records and notes without the user's consent. The vulnerability stems
  from the lack of CSRF and CORS protection in the aim dashboard. An attacker can
  exploit this by tricking a user into executing a malicious script that sends unauthorized
  requests to the aim server, leading to potential data loss and unauthorized data
  manipulation."
