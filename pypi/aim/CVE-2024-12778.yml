title: "Aim Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability"
description: "A vulnerability in aimhubio/aim version 3.25.0 allows for a denial of
  service (DoS) attack. The issue arises when a large number of tracked metrics are
  retrieved simultaneously from the Aim web API, causing the web server to become
  unresponsive. The root cause is the lack of a limit on the number of metrics that
  can be requested per call, combined with the server's single-threaded nature, leading
  to excessive resource consumption and blocking of the server."
