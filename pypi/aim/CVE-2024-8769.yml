title: "Aim  path traversal in LockManager.release_locks"
description: "A vulnerability in the `LockManager.release_locks` function in aimhubio/aim
  (commit bb76afe) allows for arbitrary file deletion through relative path traversal.
  The `run_hash` parameter, which is user-controllable, is concatenated without normalization
  as part of a path used to specify file deletion. This vulnerability is exposed through
  the `Repo._close_run()` method, which is accessible via the tracking server instruction
  API. As a result, an attacker can exploit this to delete any arbitrary file on the
  machine running the tracking server."
