title: "Aim Stored Cross-site Scripting Vulnerability"
description: "A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in aimhubio/aim
  version 3.19.3. The vulnerability arises from the improper neutralization of input
  during web page generation, specifically in the logs-tab for runs. The terminal
  output logs are displayed using the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` function in React,
  which is susceptible to XSS attacks. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability
  by injecting malicious scripts into the logs, which will be executed when a user
  views the logs-tab."
