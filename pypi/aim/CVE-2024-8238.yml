package_slug: "pypi/aim"
title: "Aim Improper Access Control"
description: "In version 3.22.0 of aimhubio/aim, the AimQL query language uses an
  outdated version of the safer_getattr() function from RestrictedPython. This version
  does not protect against the str.format_map() method, allowing an attacker to leak
  server-side secrets or potentially gain unrestricted code execution. The vulnerability
  arises because str.format_map() can read arbitrary attributes of Python objects,
  enabling attackers to access sensitive variables such as os.environ. If an attacker
  can write files to a known location on the Aim server, they can use str.format_map()
  to load a malicious .dll/.so file into the Python interpreter, leading to unrestricted
  code execution."
