title: "wolfSSL Python module vulnerable to Improper Authentication"
description: "A vulnerability in the handling of verify_mode = CERT_REQUIRED in the
  wolfssl Python package (wolfssl-py) causes client certificate requirements to not
  be fully enforced.\n\nBecause the WOLFSSL_VERIFY_FAIL_IF_NO_PEER_CERT flag was not
  included, the behavior effectively matched CERT_OPTIONAL: a peer certificate was
  verified if presented, but connections were incorrectly authenticated when no client
  certificate was provided.\n\nThis results in improper authentication, allowing attackers
  to bypass mutual TLS (mTLS) client authentication by omitting a client certificate
  during the TLS handshake.\n\nThe issue affects versions up to and including 5.8.2."
