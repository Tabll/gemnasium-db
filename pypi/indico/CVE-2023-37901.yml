title: "Indico vulnerable to Cross-Site-Scripting via confirmation prompts"
description: "There is a Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerability in confirmation prompts
  commonly used when deleting content from Indico.\nExploitation requires someone
  with at least submission privileges (such as a speaker) and then someone else to
  attempt to delete this content.\n\nConsidering that event organizers may want to
  delete suspicious-looking content when spotting it, there is a non-negligible risk
  of such an attack to succeed. The risk of this could be further increased when combined
  with some some social engineering pointing the victim towards this content."
