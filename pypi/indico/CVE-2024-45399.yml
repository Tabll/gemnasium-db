title: "Indico has a Cross-Site-Scripting during account creation"
description: "There is a Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerability during account creation
  when redirecting after the account has been successfully created.\nExploitation
  requires the user to initiate the account creation process with a maliciously crafted
  link, and then finalize the signup process. Because of this, it can only target
  newly created (and thus unprivileged) Indico users so the benefits of exploiting
  it are very limited."
