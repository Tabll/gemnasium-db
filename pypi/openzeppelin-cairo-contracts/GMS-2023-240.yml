package_slug: "pypi/openzeppelin-cairo-contracts"
title: "OpenZeppelin Contracts contains Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature"
description: "### Cause\n`is_valid_eth_signature` is missing a call to `finalize_keccak`
  after calling `verify_eth_signature`. \n\n### Impact\nAs a result, any contract
  using `is_valid_eth_signature` from the account library (such as the `EthAccount`
  preset) is vulnerable to a malicious sequencer. Specifically, the malicious sequencer
  would be able to bypass signature validation to impersonate an instance of these
  accounts.\n\n### Risk\nIn order to exploit this vulnerability, it is required to
  control a sequencer or prover since they're the ones executing the hints, being
  able to inject incorrect keccak results.\n\nToday StarkWare is the only party running
  both a prover or a sequencer, greatly reducing the risk of exploit.\n\n### Patches\nThe
  issue has been patched in 0.6.1.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions
  or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in 
  [the Contracts for Cairo repository](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/issues/new/choose)\n
