package_slug: "pypi/nautobot-device-onboarding"
title: "Clear Text Credentials Exposed via Onboarding Task"
description: "The Nautobot Device Onboarding plugin uses the netmiko and NAPALM libraries
  to simplify the onboarding process of a new device into Nautobot down to, in many
  cases, an IP Address and a Location. Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior to version
  3.0.0, credentials provided to onboarding task are visible via Job Results from
  an execution of an Onboarding Task. Version 3.0.0 fixes this issue; no known workarounds
  are available. Mitigation recommendations include deleting all Job Results for any
  onboarding task to remove clear text credentials from database entries that were
  run while on v2.0.X, upgrading to v3.0.0, and rotating any exposed credentials."
