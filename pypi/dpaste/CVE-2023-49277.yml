  the Django framework. A security vulnerability has been identified in the expires
  parameter of the dpaste API, allowing for a POST Reflected XSS attack. This vulnerability
  can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context
  of a user's browser, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data theft, or
  other malicious activities. Users are strongly advised to upgrade to dpaste release
