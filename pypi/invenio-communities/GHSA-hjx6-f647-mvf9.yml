title: "Invenio-Communities has a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in React
  components"
description: "We have identified a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability within
  certain React components related to community members in the Invenio-Communities
  module. This vulnerability enables a user to inject a script tag into the Affiliations
  field during the account registration process. The malicious script is executed
  when the user creates a new community and is listed as a public member.\n\nThe script
  is triggered whenever any user visits the Members section of any community that
  includes the compromised user. This can potentially allow the attacker to access
  personal information, such as cookies, of the visiting user."
