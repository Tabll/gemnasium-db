title: "LLama Factory Remote OS Command Injection Vulnerability"
description: "A critical remote OS command injection vulnerability has been identified
  in the Llama Factory training process. This vulnerability arises from improper handling
  of user input, allowing malicious actors to execute arbitrary OS commands on the
  host system. The issue is caused by insecure usage of the `Popen` function with
  `shell=True`, coupled with unsanitized user input. Immediate remediation is required
  to mitigate the risk."
