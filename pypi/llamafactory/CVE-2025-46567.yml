title: "LLaMA-Factory Allows Arbitrary Code Execution via Unsafe Deserialization in
  Ilamafy_baichuan2.py"
description: "A critical vulnerability exists in the `llamafy_baichuan2.py` script
  of the [LLaMA-Factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory) project. The script
  performs insecure deserialization using `torch.load()` on user-supplied `.bin` files
  from an input directory. An attacker can exploit this behavior by crafting a malicious
  `.bin` file that executes arbitrary commands during deserialization."
