title: "Code injection via unsafe YAML loading"
description: "Sockeye uses YAML to store model and data configurations on disk.  Versions
  below 2.3.24 use unsafe YAML loading, which can be made to execute arbitrary code
  embedded in config files.\n\nAn attacker can add malicious code to the config file
  of a trained model and attempt to convince users to download and run it.  If users
  run the model, the embedded code will run locally."
