description: "Sockeye is an open-source sequence-to-sequence framework for Neural
  Machine Translation built on PyTorch. Sockeye uses YAML to store model and data
  configurations on disk. use unsafe YAML loading, which can be made to execute arbitrary
  code embedded in config files. An attacker can add malicious code to the config
  file of a trained model and attempt to convince users to download and run it. If
  users run the model, the embedded code will run locally. The issue is fixed "
