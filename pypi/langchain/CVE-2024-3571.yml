title: "langchain vulnerable to path traversal"
description: "langchain-ai/langchain is vulnerable to path traversal due to improper
  limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory ('Path Traversal') in its LocalFileStore
  functionality. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to read or write files
  anywhere on the filesystem, potentially leading to information disclosure or remote
  code execution. The issue lies in the handling of file paths in the mset and mget
  methods, where user-supplied input is not adequately sanitized, allowing directory
  traversal sequences to reach unintended directories."
