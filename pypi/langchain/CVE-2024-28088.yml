package_slug: "pypi/langchain"
title: "LangChain directory traversal vulnerability"
description: "LangChain through 0.1.10 allows ../ directory traversal by an actor
  who is able to control the final part of the path parameter in a load_chain call.
  This bypasses the intended behavior of loading configurations only from the hwchase17/langchain-hub
  GitHub repository. The outcome can be disclosure of an API key for a large language
  model online service, or remote code execution."
