title: "Server-Side Request Forgery in langchain"
description: "A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the Web
  Research Retriever component of langchain-ai/langchain version 0.1.5. The vulnerability
  arises because the Web Research Retriever does not restrict requests to remote internet
  addresses, allowing it to reach local addresses. This flaw enables attackers to
  execute port scans, access local services, and in some scenarios, read instance
  metadata from cloud environments. The vulnerability is particularly concerning as
  it can be exploited to abuse the Web Explorer server as a proxy for web attacks
  on third parties and interact with servers in the local network, including reading
  their response data. This could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution, depending
  on the nature of the local services. The vulnerability is limited to GET requests,
  as POST requests are not possible, but the impact on confidentiality, integrity,
  and availability is significant due to the potential for stolen credentials and
  state-changing interactions with internal APIs."
