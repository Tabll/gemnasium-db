package_slug: "pypi/langchain"
title: "Denial of service in langchain"
description: "A Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the `SitemapLoader`
  class of the `langchain-ai/langchain` repository, affecting all versions. The `parse_sitemap`
  method, responsible for parsing sitemaps and extracting URLs, lacks a mechanism
  to prevent infinite recursion when a sitemap URL refers to the current sitemap itself.
  This oversight allows for the possibility of an infinite loop, leading to a crash
  by exceeding the maximum recursion depth in Python. This vulnerability can be exploited
  to occupy server socket/port resources and crash the Python process, impacting the
  availability of services relying on this functionality."
