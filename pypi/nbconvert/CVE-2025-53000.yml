title: "nbconvert has an uncontrolled search path that leads to unauthorized code
  execution on Windows"
description: "On Windows, converting a notebook containing SVG output to a PDF results
  in unauthorized code execution. Specifically, a third party can create a `inkscape.bat`
  file that defines a [Windows batch script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file),
  capable of arbitrary code execution.\n\nWhen a user runs `jupyter nbconvert --to
  pdf` on a notebook containing SVG output to a PDF on a Windows platform from this
  directory, the `inkscape.bat` file is run unexpectedly."
