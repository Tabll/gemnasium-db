title: "Fides Server-Side Request Forgery Vulnerability in Custom Integration Upload"
description: "### Impact\n\nThe Fides web application allows a custom integration
  to be uploaded as a ZIP file containing configuration and dataset definitions in
  YAML format. \n\nIt was discovered that specially crafted YAML dataset and config
  files allow a malicious user to perform arbitrary requests to internal systems and
  exfiltrate data outside the environment (also known as a Server-Side Request Forgery).
  The application does not perform proper validation to block attempts to connect
  to internal (including localhost) resources.\n\nExploitation is limited to API clients
  with the `CONNECTOR_TEMPLATE_REGISTER` authorization scope. In the Fides Admin UI
  this scope is restricted to highly privileged users, specifically root users and
  users with the owner role.\n\n### Patches\nThe vulnerability has been patched in
  Fides version `2.22.1`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to
  secure their systems against this threat.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere are no workarounds.\n"
