title: "Fides Webserver API Rate Limiting Vulnerability in Proxied Environments"
description: "The Fides Webserver API's built-in IP-based rate limiting is ineffective
  in environments with CDNs, proxies or load balancers. The system incorrectly applies
  rate limits based on directly connected infrastructure IPs rather than client IPs,
  and stores counters in-memory rather than in a shared store. This allows attackers
  to bypass intended rate limits and potentially cause denial of service.\n\nThis
  vulnerability only affects deployments relying on Fides's built-in rate limiting
  for protection. Deployments using external rate limiting solutions (WAFs, API gateways,
  etc.) are not affected."
