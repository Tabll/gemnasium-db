title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing the
  fulfillment of data privacy requests in a runtime environment, and the enforcement
  of privacy regulations in code. A path traversal (directory traversal) vulnerability
  affects fides versions lower than version `2.15.1`, allowing remote attackers to
  access arbitrary files on the fides webserver container's filesystem. The vulnerability
  is patched in fides `2.15.1`.\n\nIf the Fides webserver API is not directly accessible
  to attackers and is instead deployed behind a reverse proxy as recommended in Ethyca's
  security best practice documentation, and the reverse proxy is an AWS application
  load balancer, the vulnerability can't be exploited by these attackers. An AWS application
  load balancer will reject this attack with a 400 error. Additionally, any secrets
  supplied to the container using environment variables rather than a `fides.toml`
  configuration file are not affected by this vulnerability.\n"
