title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing data
  privacy requests and privacy regulations. The Fides webserver is vulnerable to a
  type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Attackers can exploit a weakness in the
  connector template upload feature to upload a malicious zip bomb file, resulting
  in resource exhaustion and service unavailability for all users of the Fides webserver.
  This vulnerability affects Fides versions `2.11.0` through `2.15.1`. Exploitation
  is limited to users with elevated privileges with the `CONNECTOR_TEMPLATE_REGISTER`
  scope, which includes root users and users with the owner role. The vulnerability
  has been patched in Fides version `2.16.0`. Users are advised to upgrade to this
  version or later to secure their systems against this threat. There is no known
  workaround to remediate this vulnerability without upgrading. If an attack occurs,
  the impact can be mitigated by manually or automatically restarting the affected
  container.\n"
