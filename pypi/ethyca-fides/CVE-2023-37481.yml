package_slug: "pypi/ethyca-fides"
title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing data
  privacy requests and privacy regulations. The Fides webserver is vulnerable to a
  type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability
  to upload zip files containing malicious SVG bombs (similar to a billion laughs
  attack), causing resource exhaustion in Admin UI browser tabs and creating a persistent
  denial of service of the 'new connector' page (`datastore-connection/new`). This
  vulnerability affects Fides versions `2.11.0` through `2.15.1`. Exploitation is
  limited to users with elevated privileges with the `CONNECTOR_TEMPLATE_REGISTER`
  scope, which includes root users and users with the owner role. The vulnerability
  has been patched in Fides version `2.16.0`. Users are advised to upgrade to this
  version or later to secure their systems against this threat. There is no known
  workaround to remediate this vulnerability without upgrading."
