title: "Remote Code Execution Vulnerability via SSTI in Fides Webserver Jinja Email
  Templating Engine"
description: "The Email Templating feature uses Jinja2 without proper input sanitization
  or rendering environment restrictions, allowing for Server-Side Template Injection
  that grants Remote Code Execution to privileged users. A privileged user refers
  to an Admin UI user with the default `Owner` or `Contributor` role, who can escalate
  their access and execute code on the underlying Fides Webserver container where
  the Jinja template rendering function is executed."
