title: "Timing-Based Username Enumeration Vulnerability in Fides Webserver Authentication"
description: "A timing-based username enumeration vulnerability has been identified
  in Fides Webserver authentication. This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated
  attacker to determine the existence of valid usernames by analyzing the time it
  takes for the server to respond to login requests. The discrepancy in response times
  between valid and invalid usernames can be leveraged to enumerate users on the system."
