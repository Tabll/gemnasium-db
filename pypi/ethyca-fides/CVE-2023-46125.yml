title: "Fides Information Disclosure Vulnerability in Config API Endpoint"
description: "### Impact\nThe Fides webserver API allows users to retrieve its configuration
  using the `GET api/v1/config` endpoint. The configuration data is filtered to suppress
  most sensitive configuration information before it is returned to the user, but
  even the filtered data contains information about the internals and the backend
  infrastructure, such as various settings, serversâ€™ addresses and ports and database
  username. This information is useful for administrative users as well as attackers,
  thus it should not be revealed to low-privileged users.\n\nThis vulnerability allows
  Admin UI users with roles lower than the owner role e.g. the viewer role to retrieve
  the config information using the API. \n\n### Patches\nThe vulnerability has been
  patched in Fides version `2.22.1`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version
  or later to secure their systems against this threat.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere
  are no workarounds.\n"
