title: "Fides JavaScript Injection Vulnerability in Privacy Center URL"
description: "### Impact\nThe Fides web application allows users to edit consent and
  privacy notices such as cookie banners. These privacy notices can then be served
  by other integrated websites, for example in cookie consent banners. One of the
  editable fields is a privacy policy URL and this input was found to not be validated.\n\nThe
  vulnerability makes it possible to craft a payload in the privacy policy URL which
  triggers JavaScript execution when the privacy notice is served by an integrated
  website. The domain scope of the executed JavaScript is that of the integrated website.\n\nExploitation
  is limited to Admin UI users with the contributor role or higher.\n\n### Patches\nThe
  vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.22.1`. Users are advised to upgrade
  to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere
  are no workarounds.\n"
