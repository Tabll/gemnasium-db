title: "Password Policy Bypass Vulnerability in Fides Webserver User Accept Invite
  API"
description: "The user invite acceptance API endpoint lacks server-side password policy
  enforcement, allowing users to set arbitrarily weak passwords by bypassing client-side
  validation. While the UI enforces password complexity requirements, direct API calls
  can circumvent these checks, enabling the creation of accounts with passwords as
  short as a single character."
