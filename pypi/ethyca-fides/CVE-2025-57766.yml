title: "Fides' Admin UI User Password Change Does Not Invalidate Current Session"
description: "Admin UI user password changes in Fides do not invalidate active user
  sessions, creating a vulnerability chaining opportunity where attackers who have
  obtained session tokens through other attack vectors (such as XSS) can maintain
  access even after password reset. This issue is not directly exploitable on its
  own and requires a prerequisite vulnerability to obtain valid session tokens in
  the first place."
