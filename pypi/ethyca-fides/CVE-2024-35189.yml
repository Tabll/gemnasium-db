title: "Sensitive Data Disclosure Vulnerability in Connection Configuration Endpoints"
description: "The Fides webserver has a number of endpoints that retrieve `ConnectionConfiguration`
  records and their associated `secrets` which _can_ contain sensitive data (e.g.
  passwords, private keys, etc.). These `secrets` are stored encrypted at rest (in
  the application database), and the associated endpoints are not meant to expose
  that sensitive data in plaintext to API clients, as it could be compromising.\n\nFides's
  developers have available to them a Pydantic field-attribute (`sensitive`) that
  they can annotate as `True` to indicate that a given secret field should not be
  exposed via the API. The application has an internal function that uses `sensitive`
  annotations to mask the sensitive fields with a `\"**********\"` placeholder value.\n\nThis
  vulnerability is due to a bug in that function, which prevented `sensitive` API
  model fields that were _nested_ below the root-level of a `secrets` object from
  being masked appropriately. Only the `BigQuery` connection configuration secrets
  meets these criteria: the secrets schema has a nested sensitive `keyfile_creds.private_key`
  property that is exposed in plaintext via the APIs.\n\nConnection types other than
  `BigQuery` with sensitive fields at the root-level that are not nested are properly
  masked with the placeholder and are not affected by this vulnerability."
