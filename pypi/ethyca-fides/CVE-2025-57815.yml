title: "Fides has a Lack of Brute-Force Protections on Authentication Endpoints"
description: "The Fides Admin UI login endpoint relies on a general IP-based rate
  limit for all API traffic and lacks specific anti-automation controls designed to
  protect against brute-force attacks. This could allow attackers to conduct credential
  testing attacks, such as credential stuffing or password spraying, which poses a
  risk to accounts with weak or previously compromised passwords."
