title: "Tendenci Affected by Authenticated Remote Code Execution via Pickle Deserialization"
description: "A critical deserialization vulnerability exists in Tendenci Helpdesk
  module (NOTE, by default, Helpdesk is NOT enabled), affecting the version 15.3.11
  and earlier. This vulnerability allows remote code execution (RCE) by an authenticated
  user with staff security level due to using Python's pickle module on the helpdesk
  /reports/. The damage is contained to the user that your Tendenci application runs.\n\n**Key
  Finding:** The original CVE-2020-14942 was incompletely patched. While `ticket_list()`
  was fixed to use safe JSON deserialization, the `run_report()` function still uses
  unsafe `pickle.loads()`.\n\n**Permission Scoping:** The impact is limited to the
  permissions of the user running the application, typically www-data, which generally
  lacks write (except for upload directories) and execute permissions."
