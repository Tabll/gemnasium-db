package_slug: "pypi/safety"
title: "Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision"
description: "The safety package for Python has a potential security issue. There
  are two Python characteristics that allow malicious code to `poison-pill` command-line
  Safety package detection routines by disguising, or obfuscating, other malicious
  or non-secure packages. This vulnerability is considered to be of low severity because
  the attack makes use of an existing Python condition, not the Safety tool itself."
