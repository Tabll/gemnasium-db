title: "Jinja has a sandbox breakout through indirect reference to format method"
description: "An oversight in how the Jinja sandboxed environment detects calls to
  `str.format` allows an attacker that controls the content of a template to execute
  arbitrary Python code.\n\nTo exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control
  the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application
  using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted
  templates.\n\nJinja's sandbox does catch calls to `str.format` and ensures they
  don't escape the sandbox. However, it's possible to store a reference to a malicious
  string's `format` method, then pass that to a filter that calls it. No such filters
  are built-in to Jinja, but could be present through custom filters in an application.
  After the fix, such indirect calls are also handled by the sandbox."
