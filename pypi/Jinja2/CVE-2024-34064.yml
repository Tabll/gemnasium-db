title: "Jinja vulnerable to HTML attribute injection when passing user input as keys
  to xmlattr filter"
description: "The `xmlattr` filter in affected versions of Jinja accepts keys containing
  non-attribute characters. XML/HTML attributes cannot contain spaces, `/`, `>`, or
  `=`, as each would then be interpreted as starting a separate attribute. If an application
  accepts keys (as opposed to only values) as user input, and renders these in pages
  that other users see as well, an attacker could use this to inject other attributes
  and perform XSS. The fix for the previous GHSA-h5c8-rqwp-cp95 CVE-2024-22195 only
  addressed spaces but not other characters.\n\nAccepting keys as user input is now
  explicitly considered an unintended use case of the `xmlattr` filter, and code that
  does so without otherwise validating the input should be flagged as insecure, regardless
  of Jinja version. Accepting _values_ as user input continues to be safe."
