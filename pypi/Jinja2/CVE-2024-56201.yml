package_slug: "pypi/Jinja2"
title: "Jinja has a sandbox breakout through malicious filenames"
description: "A bug in the Jinja compiler allows an attacker that controls both the
  content and filename of a template to execute arbitrary Python code, regardless
  of if Jinja's sandbox is used.\n\nTo exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs
  to control both the filename and the contents of a template. Whether that is the
  case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts
  users of applications which execute untrusted templates where the template author
  can also choose the template filename."
