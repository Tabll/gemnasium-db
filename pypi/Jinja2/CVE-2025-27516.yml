title: "Jinja2 vulnerable to sandbox breakout through attr filter selecting format
  method"
description: "An oversight in how the Jinja sandboxed environment interacts with the
  `|attr` filter allows an attacker that controls the content of a template to execute
  arbitrary Python code.\n\nTo exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control
  the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application
  using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted
  templates.\n\nJinja's sandbox does catch calls to `str.format` and ensures they
  don't escape the sandbox. However, it's possible to use the `|attr` filter to get
  a reference to a string's plain format method, bypassing the sandbox. After the
  fix, the `|attr` filter no longer bypasses the environment's attribute lookup."
