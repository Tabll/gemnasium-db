package_slug: "pypi/Jinja2"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "Jinja is an extensible templating engine. Special placeholders in the
  template allow writing code similar to Python syntax. It is possible to inject arbitrary
  HTML attributes into the rendered HTML template, potentially leading to Cross-Site
  Scripting (XSS). The Jinja `xmlattr` filter can be abused to inject arbitrary HTML
  attribute keys and values, bypassing the auto escaping mechanism and potentially
  leading to XSS. It may also be possible to bypass attribute validation checks if
  they are block list-based.\n"
