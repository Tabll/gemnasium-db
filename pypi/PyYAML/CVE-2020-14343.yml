identifier: "CVE-2020-14343"
package_slug: "pypi/PyYAML"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "A vulnerability was discovered in the PyYAML library, where it is susceptible
  to arbitrary code execution when it processes untrusted YAML files through the `full_load`
  method or with the `FullLoader` loader. Applications that use the library to process
  untrusted input may be vulnerable to this flaw. This flaw allows an attacker to
  execute arbitrary code on the system by abusing the `python/object/new` constructor.
  This flaw is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-1747."
