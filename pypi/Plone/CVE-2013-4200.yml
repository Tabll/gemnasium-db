description: "The isURLInPortal method in the URLTool class in in_portal.py in Plone
  2.1 through 4.1, 4.2.x through 4.2.5, and 4.3.x through 4.3.1 treats URLs starting
  with a space as a relative URL, which allows remote attackers to bypass the allow_external_login_sites
  filtering property, redirect users to arbitrary web sites, and conduct phishing
  attacks via a space before a URL in the \"next\" parameter to acl_users/credentials_cookie_auth/require_login."
