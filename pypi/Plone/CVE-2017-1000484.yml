package_slug: "pypi/Plone"
title: "Plone Open Redirect"
description: "By linking to a specific url in Plone 2.5-5.1rc1 with a parameter, an
  attacker could send you to his own website. On its own this is not so bad: the attacker
  could more easily link directly to his own website instead. But in combination with
  another attack, you could be sent to the Plone login form and login, then get redirected
  to the specific url, and then get a second redirect to the attacker website."
