title: "Plone anonymous access to sub-objects in CMFEditions where KwAsAttributes
  classes were publishable"
description: "The CMFEditions component 2.x in Plone 4.0.x through 4.0.9, 4.1, and
  4.2 through 4.2a2 does not prevent the KwAsAttributes classes from being publishable,
  which allows remote attackers to access sub-objects via unspecified vectors, a different
