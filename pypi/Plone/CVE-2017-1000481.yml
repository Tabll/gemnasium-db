title: "URL Redirection to Untrusted Site (Open Redirect)"
description: "When you visit a page where you need to log in, Plone sends you to the
  login-form with a `came_from` parameter set to the previous url. After you log in,
  you get redirected to the page you tried to view before. An attacker might try to
  abuse this by letting you click on a specially crafted link."
