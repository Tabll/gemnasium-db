package_slug: "pypi/pretix"
title: "pretix Stored Cross-site Scripting vulnerability"
description: "Stored XSS in organizer and event settings of pretix up to 2024.7.0
  allows malicious event organizers to inject HTML tags into e-mail previews on settings
  page. The default Content Security Policy of pretix prevents execution of attacker-provided
  scripts, making exploitation unlikely. However, combined with a CSP bypass (which
  is not currently known) the vulnerability could be used to impersonate other organizers
  or staff users."
