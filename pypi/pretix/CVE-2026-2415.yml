title: "pretix unsafely evaluates variables in emails"
description: "Emails sent by pretix can utilize placeholders that will be filled with
  customer data. For example, when `{name}` is used in an email template, it will
  \ be replaced with the buyer's name for the final email. This mechanism contained
  two security-relevant bugs:\n\n-  It was possible to exfiltrate information about
  the pretix system through specially crafted placeholder names such as `{event.__init__.__code__.co_filename}}`.
  This way, an attacker with the ability to control email templates (usually every
  user of the pretix backend) could retrieve sensitive information from the system
  configuration, including even database passwords or API keys. pretix does include
  mechanisms to prevent the usage of such malicious placeholders, however due to a
  mistake in the code, they were not fully effective for the email subject.\n\n-  Placeholders
  in subjects and plain text bodies of emails were wrongfully evaluated twice. Therefore,
  if the first evaluation of a placeholder again contains a placeholder, this second
  placeholder was rendered. This allows the rendering of placeholders controlled by
  the ticket buyer, and therefore the exploitation of the first issue as a ticket
  buyer. Luckily, the only buyer-controlled placeholder available in pretix by default
  (that is not validated in a way that prevents the issue) is `{invoice_company}`,
  which is very unusual (but not impossible) to be contained in an email subject template.
  In addition to broadening the attack surface of the first issue, this could theoretically
  also leak information about an order to one of the attendees within that order.
  However, we also consider this scenario very unlikely under typical conditions.\n\nOut
  of caution, pretix recommend that you rotate all passwords and API keys contained
  in your pretix.cfg https://docs.pretix.eu/self-hosting/config/  file."
