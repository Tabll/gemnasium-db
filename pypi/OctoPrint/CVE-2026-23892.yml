title: "OctoPrint has Timing Side-Channel Vulnerability in API Key Authentication"
description: "OctoPrint versions up to and including 1.11.5 are affected by a (theoretical)
  timing attack vulnerability that allows API key extraction over the network.\n\nDue
  to using character based comparison that short-circuits on the first mismatched
  character during API key validation, rather than a cryptographical method with static
  runtime regardless of the point of mismatch, an attacker with network based access
  to an affected OctoPrint could extract API keys valid on the instance by measuring
  the response times of the denied access responses and guess an API key character
  by character."
