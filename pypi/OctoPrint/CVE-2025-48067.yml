package_slug: "pypi/OctoPrint"
title: "OctoPrint vulnerable to possible file extraction via upload endpoints"
description: "OctoPrint versions up until and including 1.11.1 contain a vulnerability
  that allows an attacker with the `FILE_UPLOAD` permission to exfiltrate files from
  the host that OctoPrint has read access to, by moving them into the upload folder
  where they then can be downloaded from.\n\nThe primary risk lies in the potential
  exfiltration of secrets stored inside OctoPrint's config, or further system files.
  By removing important runtime files, this could also be used to impact the availability
  of the host. Given that the attacker requires a user account with file upload permissions,
  the actual impact of this should however hopefully be minimal in most cases."
