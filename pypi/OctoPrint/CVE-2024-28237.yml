description: "OctoPrint versions up until and including 1.9.3 contain a vulnerability
  that allows malicious admins to configure or talk a victim with administrator rights
  into configuring a webcam snapshot URL which when tested through the \"Test\" button
  included in the web interface will execute JavaScript code in the victims browser
  when attempting to render the snapshot image.\n\nAn attacker who successfully talked
  a victim with admin rights into performing a snapshot test with such a crafted URL
  could use this to retrieve or modify sensitive configuration settings, interrupt
  prints or otherwise interact with the OctoPrint instance in a malicious way."
