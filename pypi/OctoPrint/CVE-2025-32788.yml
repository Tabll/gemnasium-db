title: "OctoPrint Authenticated Reverse Proxy Page Authentication Bypass"
description: "OctoPrint versions up until and including 1.10.3 contain a vulnerability
  that allows an attacker to bypass the login redirect and directly access the rendered
  HTML of certain frontend pages.\n\nThe impact on data exposure is minimal because,
  typically, data is loaded via API requests that correctly enforce user authentication.
  In the current codebase, cases where data is directly embedded in the page content
  are rare. However, one notable exception is the authenticated variant of the reverse
  proxy test page, which displays the IP addresses of configured reverse proxies.\n\nThe
  primary risk lies in potential future modifications to the codebase that might incorrectly
  rely on the vulnerable internal functions for authentication checks, leading to
  security vulnerabilities."
