title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine"
description: "OctoPrint is a web interface for 3D printers. OctoPrint versions up
  until and including 1.9.2 contain a vulnerability that allows malicious admins to
  configure a specially crafted GCODE script that will allow code execution during
  rendering of that script. An attacker might use this to extract data managed by
  OctoPrint, or manipulate data managed by OctoPrint, as well as execute arbitrary
  commands with the rights of the OctoPrint process on the server system. OctoPrint
  versions from 1.9.3 onward have been patched. Administrators of OctoPrint instances
  are advised to make sure they can trust all other administrators on their instance
  and to also not blindly configure arbitrary GCODE scripts found online or provided
  to them by third parties."
