title: "OctoPrint has an Authentication Bypass via X-Forwarded-For Header when autologinLocal

description: "OctoPrint versions up until and including 1.10.0 contain a vulnerability
  that allows an unauthenticated attacker to completely bypass the authentication
  **if the `autologinLocal` option is enabled** within `config.yaml`, even if they
  come from networks that are not configured as `localNetworks`, by spoofing their
  IP via the `X-Forwarded-For` header.\n\nIf autologin is not enabled, this vulnerability
  does not have any impact."
