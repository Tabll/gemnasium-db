title: "pyrage vulnerable to malicious plugin names, recipients, or identities causing
  arbitrary binary execution"
description: "`pyrage` uses the Rust `age` crate for its underlying operations, and
  `age` is vulnerable to GHSA-4fg7-vxc8-qx5w.\n\nAll details of GHSA-4fg7-vxc8-qx5w
  are relevant to `pyrage` for the versions specified in this advisory. See GHSA-4fg7-vxc8-qx5w
  for full details.\n\nVersions of `pyrage` before 1.2.0 lack plugin support and are
  therefore **not affected**.\n\nAn equivalent issue was fixed in [the reference Go
  implementation of age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age), see advisory [GHSA-32gq-x56h-299c](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age/security/advisories/GHSA-32gq-x56h-299c).\n\nThanks
