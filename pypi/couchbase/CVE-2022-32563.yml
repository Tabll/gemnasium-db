title: "Couchbase Sync Gateway admin credentials not verified when using X.509 client
  cert authentication"
description: "An issue was discovered in Couchbase Sync Gateway 3.x before 3.0.2.
  Admin credentials are not verified when using X.509 client-certificate authentication
  from Sync Gateway to Couchbase Server. When Sync Gateway is configured to authenticate
  with Couchbase Server using X.509 client certificates, the admin credentials provided
  to the Admin REST API are ignored, resulting in privilege escalation for unauthenticated
  users. The Public REST API is not impacted by this issue. A workaround is to replace
  X.509 certificate based authentication with Username and Password authentication
  inside the bootstrap configuration."
