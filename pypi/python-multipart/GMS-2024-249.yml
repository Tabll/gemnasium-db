title: "python-multipart  vulnerable to Content-Type Header ReDoS"
description: "When using form data, `python-multipart` uses a Regular
  Expression to parse the HTTP `Content-Type` header, including options. An attacker
  could send a custom-made `Content-Type` option that is very difficult for the RegEx
  to process, consuming CPU resources and stalling indefinitely (minutes or more)
  while holding the main event loop."
