identifiers:
- "CVE-2024-53981"
- "GHSA-59g5-xgcq-4qw3"
package_slug: "pypi/python-multipart"
title: "Denial of service (DoS) via deformation `multipart/form-data` boundary"
description: "When parsing form data, `python-multipart` skips line breaks (CR `\\r`
  or LF `\\n`) in front of the first boundary and any tailing bytes after the last
  boundary. This happens one byte at a time and emits a log event each time, which
  may cause excessive logging for certain inputs.\n\nAn attacker could abuse this
  by sending a malicious request with lots of data before the first or after the last
  boundary, causing high CPU load and stalling the processing thread for a significant
  amount of time. In case of ASGI application, this could stall the event loop and
  prevent other requests from being processed, resulting in a denial of service (DoS)."
