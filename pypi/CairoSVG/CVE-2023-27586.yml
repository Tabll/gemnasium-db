title: "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
description: "CairoSVG is an SVG converter based on Cairo, a 2D graphics library.
  Prior to version 2.7.0, Cairo can send requests to external hosts when processing
  SVG files. A malicious actor could send a specially crafted SVG file that allows
  them to perform a server-side request forgery or denial of service. Version 2.7.0
  disables CairoSVG's ability to access other files online by default."
