identifier: "CVE-2020-35681"
package_slug: "pypi/channels"
title: "Information Exposure"
description: "Django Channels allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information
  from a different request scope. The legacy `channels.http.AsgiHandler` class, used
  for handling HTTP type requests in an ASGI environment prior to Django, did not
  correctly separate request scopes in Channels In many cases this would result in
  a crash but, with correct timing, responses could be sent to the wrong client, resulting
  in potential leakage of session identifiers and other sensitive data. Note that
  this affects only the legacy Channels provided class, and not Django's similar `ASGIHandler`,
  available from Django."
