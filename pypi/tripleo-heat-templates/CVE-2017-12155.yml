description: "A resource-permission flaw was found in the openstack-tripleo-heat-templates
  package where ceph.client.openstack.keyring is created as world-readable. A local
  attacker with access to the key could read or modify data on Ceph cluster pools
  for OpenStack as though the attacker were the OpenStack service, thus potentially
  reading or modifying data in an OpenStack Block Storage volume."
