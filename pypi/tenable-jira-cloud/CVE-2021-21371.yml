identifier: "CVE-2021-21371"
package_slug: "pypi/tenable-jira-cloud"
title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "In tenable-jira-cloud,
  it is possible to run arbitrary commands through the `yaml.load()` method. This could
  allow an attacker with local access to the host to run arbitrary code by running
  the application with a specially crafted YAML configuration file. This is fixed
  by using `yaml.safe_load()` instead of `yaml.load()`."
