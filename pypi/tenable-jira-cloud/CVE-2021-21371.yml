package_slug: "pypi/tenable-jira-cloud"
title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "In tenable-jira-cloud, it is possible to run arbitrary commands through
  the `yaml.load()` method. This could allow an attacker with local access to the
  host to run arbitrary code by running the application with a specially crafted YAML
  configuration file. This is fixed by using `yaml.safe_load()` instead of `yaml.load()`."
