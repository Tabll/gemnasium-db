package_slug: "pypi/local-deep-research"
title: "Local Deep Research is Vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in
  Download Service"
description: "The download service (`download_service.py`) makes HTTP requests using
  raw `requests.get()` without utilizing the application's SSRF protection (`safe_requests.py`).
  This can allow attackers to access internal services and attempt to reach cloud
  provider metadata endpoints (AWS/GCP/Azure), as well as perform internal network
  reconnaissance, by submitting malicious URLs through the API, depending on the deployment
  and surrounding controls.\n\n**CWE**: CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery)\n\n---"
