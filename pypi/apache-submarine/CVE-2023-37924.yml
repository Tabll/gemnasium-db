title: "SQL injection in Apache Submarine"
description: "Apache Software Foundation Apache Submarine has an SQL injection vulnerability
  when a user logs in. This issue can result in unauthorized login.\nNow we have fixed
  this issue and now user must have the correct login to access workbench.\nThis issue
  affects Apache Submarine: from 0.7.0 before 0.8.0.Â We recommend that all submarine
  users with 0.7.0 upgrade to 0.8.0, which not only fixes the issue, supports the
  oidc authentication mode, but also removes the case of unauthenticated logins.\nIf
  using the version lower than 0.8.0 and not want to upgrade, you can try cherry-pick
  PR https://github.com/apache/submarine/pull/1037 https://github.com/apache/submarine/pull/1054
  and rebuild the submarine-server image to fix this.\n\n"
