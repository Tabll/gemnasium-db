title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data in apache-submarine"
description: "Apache Software Foundation Apache Submarine has a bug when serializing
  against yaml. The bug is caused by snakeyaml https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1471
  .\n\nApache Submarine uses JAXRS to define REST endpoints. In order to\nhandle YAML
  requests (using application/yaml content-type), it defines\na YamlEntityProvider
  entity provider that will process all incoming\nYAML requests. In order to unmarshal
  the request, the readFrom method\nis invoked, passing the entityStream containing
  the user-supplied data in `submarine-server/server-core/src/main/java/org/apache/submarine/server/utils/YamlUtils.java`.\n
  \nWe have now fixed this issue in the new version by replacing to `jackson-dataformat-yaml`.\nThis
  issue affects Apache Submarine: from 0.7.0 before 0.8.0.Â Users are recommended to
  upgrade to version 0.8.0, which fixes this issue.\nIf using the version smaller
  than 0.8.0 and not want to upgrade, you can try cherry-pick PR https://github.com/apache/submarine/pull/1054
  and rebuild the submart-server image to fix this.\n\n"
