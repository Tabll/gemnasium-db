title: "Apache Superset vulnerable to improper SQL authorization"
description: "An SQL Injection vulnerability in Apache Superset exists due to improper
  neutralization of special elements used in SQL commands. Specifically, certain engine-specific
  functions are not checked, which allows attackers to bypass Apache Superset's SQL
  authorization. To mitigate this, a new configuration key named DISALLOWED_SQL_FUNCTIONS
  has been introduced. This key disallows the use of the following PostgreSQL functions:
  version, query_to_xml, inet_server_addr, and inet_client_addr. Additional functions
  can be added to this list for increased protection.\n\nThis issue affects Apache
  Superset: before 4.0.2.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 4.0.2, which
  fixes the issue."
