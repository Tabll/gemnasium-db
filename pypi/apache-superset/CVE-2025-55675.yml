title: "Apache Superset allows authenticated users to discover metadata about datasources
  they don't have permission to access"
description: "Apache Superset contains an improper access control vulnerability in
  its /explore endpoint. A missing authorization check allows an authenticated user
  to discover metadata about datasources they do not have permission to access. By
  iterating through the datasource_id in the URL, an attacker can enumerate and confirm
  the existence and names of protected datasources, leading to sensitive information
  disclosure.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Superset: before 5.0.0.\n\nUsers are recommended
  to upgrade to version 5.0.0, which fixes the issue."
