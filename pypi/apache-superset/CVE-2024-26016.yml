title: "Apache Superset: Improper authorization validation on dashboards and charts
  import"
description: "A low privilege authenticated user could import an existing dashboard
  or chart that they do not have access to and then modify its metadata, thereby gaining
  ownership of the object. However, it's important to note that access to the analytical
  data of these charts and dashboards would still be subject to validation based on
  data access privileges.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Superset: before 3.0.4, from
  3.1.0 before 3.1.1.Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.1.1, which fixes
  the issue.\n\n"
