title: "Apache Superset has bypass of `DISALLOWED_SQL_FUNCTIONS` that allows execution
  of blocked SQL functions"
description: "A bypass of the DISALLOWED_SQL_FUNCTIONS security feature in Apache
  Superset allows for the execution of blocked SQL functions. An attacker can use
  a special inline block to circumvent the denylist. This allows a user with SQL Lab
  access to execute functions that were intended to be disabled, leading to the disclosure
  of sensitive database information like the software version.\n\nThis issue affects
  Apache Superset: before 5.0.0.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 5.0.0,
  which fixes the issue."
