description: "### Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it
  is a duplicate of GHSA-f678-j579-4xf5. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n### Original Description\n\nImproper authorization check and possible
  privilege escalation on Apache SupersetÂ up to but excluding 2.1.2. Using the default
  examples database connection that allows access to both the examples schema and
  Apache Superset's metadata database, an attacker using a specially crafted CTE SQL
  statement could change data on the metadata database. This weakness could result
  on tampering with the authentication/authorization data."
