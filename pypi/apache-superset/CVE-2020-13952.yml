title: "Query Injection"
description: "In the course of work on the open source project it was discovered that
  authenticated users running queries against Hive and Presto database engines could
  access information via a number of templated fields including the contents of query
  description metadata database, the hashed version of the authenticated usersâ€™ password,
  and access to connection information including the plaintext password for the current
  connection. It would also be possible to run arbitrary methods on the database connection
  object for the Presto or Hive connection, allowing the user to bypass security controls
  internal to Superset. This vulnerability is present in every Apache Superset version
  < 0.37.2."
