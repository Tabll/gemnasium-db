package_slug: "pypi/powerline-gitstatus"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command
  Injection')"
description: "powerline-gitstatus (aka Powerline Gitstatus) before 1.3.2 allows arbitrary
  code execution. git repositories can contain per-repository configuration that changes
  the behavior of git, including running arbitrary commands. When using powerline-gitstatus,
  changing to a directory automatically runs git commands in order to display information
  about the current repository in the prompt. If an attacker can convince a user to
  change their current directory to one controlled by the attacker, such as in a shared
  filesystem or extracted archive, powerline-gitstatus will run arbitrary commands
  under the attacker's control. NOTE: this is similar to CVE-2022-20001."
