package_slug: "pypi/lollms"
title: "LoLLMS Code Injection vulnerability"
description: "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Calculate function
  of parisneo/lollms version 9.8. The vulnerability arises from the use of Python's
  `eval()` function to evaluate mathematical expressions within a Python sandbox that
  disables `__builtins__` and only allows functions from the `math` module. This sandbox
  can be bypassed by loading the `os` module using the `_frozen_importlib.BuiltinImporter`
  class, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server. The issue
  is fixed in version 9.10."
