package_slug: "pypi/lollms"
title: "LoLLMS Command Injection vulnerability"
description: "A vulnerability in the parisneo/lollms, specifically in the `/unInstall_binding`
  endpoint, allows for arbitrary code execution due to insufficient sanitization of
  user input. The issue arises from the lack of path sanitization when handling the
  `name` parameter in the `unInstall_binding` function, allowing an attacker to traverse
  directories and execute arbitrary code by loading a malicious `__init__.py` file.
  This vulnerability affects the latest version of the software. The exploitation
  of this vulnerability could lead to remote code execution on the system where parisneo/lollms
  is deployed."
