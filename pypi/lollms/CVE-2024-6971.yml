package_slug: "pypi/lollms"
title: "Lord of Large Language Models (LoLLMs) Server path traversal vulnerability
  in lollms_file_system.py"
description: "A path traversal vulnerability exists in the ParisNeo/lollms repository,
  specifically in the `lollms_file_system.py` file. The functions `add_rag_database`,
  `toggle_mount_rag_database`, and `vectorize_folder` do not implement security measures
  such as `sanitize_path_from_endpoint` or `sanitize_path`. This allows an attacker
  to perform vectorize operations on `.sqlite` files in any directory on the victim's
  computer, potentially installing multiple packages and causing a crash."
