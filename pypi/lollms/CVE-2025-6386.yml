title: "Lord of Large Language Models vulnerable to Observable Discrepancy attack
  via authenticate_user function"
description: "The parisneo/lollms repository is affected by a timing attack vulnerability
  in the `authenticate_user` function within the `lollms_authentication.py` file.
  This vulnerability allows attackers to enumerate valid usernames and guess passwords
  incrementally by analyzing response time differences. The affected version is the
  latest, and the issue is resolved in commit f78437f. The vulnerability arises from
  the use of Python's default string equality operator for password comparison, which
  compares characters sequentially and exits on the first mismatch, leading to variable
  response times based on the number of matching initial characters."
