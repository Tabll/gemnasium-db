title: "Remote Code Execution in create_conda_env function in lollms"
description: "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the create_conda_env
  function of the parisneo/lollms repository. The vulnerability arises from the use
  of shell=True in the subprocess.Popen function, which allows an attacker to inject
  arbitrary commands by manipulating the env_name and python_version parameters. This
  issue could lead to a serious security breach as demonstrated by the ability to
  execute the 'whoami' command among potentially other harmful commands."
