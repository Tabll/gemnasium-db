package_slug: "pypi/lollms"
title: "Lollms vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting"
description: "A vulnerability in the discussion image upload function of the Lollms
  application, version v9.9, allows for the uploading of SVG files. Due to incomplete
  filtering in the sanitize_svg function, this can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS)
  vulnerabilities, which in turn pose a risk of remote code execution. The sanitize_svg
  function only removes script elements and 'on*' event attributes, but does not account
  for other potential vectors for XSS within SVG files. This vulnerability can be
  exploited when authorized users access a malicious URL containing the crafted SVG
  file."
