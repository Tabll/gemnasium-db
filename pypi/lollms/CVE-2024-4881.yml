title: "LoLLMS Path Traversal vulnerability"
description: "A path traversal vulnerability exists in the parisneo/lollms application,
  affecting version 9.4.0 and potentially earlier versions, but fixed in version 9.5.0.
  The vulnerability arises due to improper validation of file paths between Windows
  and Linux environments, allowing attackers to traverse beyond the intended directory
  and read any file on the Windows system. Specifically, the application fails to
  adequately sanitize file paths containing backslashes (`\\`), which can be exploited
  to access the root directory and read, or even delete, sensitive files. This issue
  was discovered in the context of the `/user_infos` endpoint, where a crafted request
  using backslashes to reference a file (e.g., `\\windows\\win.ini`) could result
  in unauthorized file access. The impact of this vulnerability includes the potential
  for attackers to access sensitive information such as environment variables, database
  files, and configuration files, which could lead to further compromise of the system."
