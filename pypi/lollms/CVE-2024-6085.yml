title: "lollms vulnerable to path traversal due to unauthenticated root folder settings
  change"
description: "A path traversal vulnerability exists in the XTTS server included in
  the lollms package, version v9.6. This vulnerability arises from the ability to
  perform an unauthenticated root folder settings change. Although the read file endpoint
  is protected against path traversals, this protection can be bypassed by changing
  the root folder to '/'. This allows attackers to read arbitrary files on the system.
  Additionally, the output folders can be changed to write arbitrary audio files to
  any location on the system."
