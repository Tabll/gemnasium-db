title: "path traversal vulnerability was identified in the parisneo/lollms-webui "
description: "A path traversal vulnerability was identified in the parisneo/lollms-webui
  repository, specifically within version 9.6. The vulnerability arises due to improper
  handling of user-supplied input in the 'list_personalities' endpoint. By crafting
  a malicious HTTP request, an attacker can traverse the directory structure and view
  the contents of any folder, albeit limited to subfolder names only. This issue was
  demonstrated via a specific HTTP request that manipulated the 'category' parameter
  to access arbitrary directories. The vulnerability is present in the code located
  at the 'endpoints/lollms_advanced.py' file."
