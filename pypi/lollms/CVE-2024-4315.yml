title: "parisneo/lollms Local File Inclusion (LFI) attack"
description: "parisneo/lollms version 9.5 is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI)
  attacks due to insufficient path sanitization. The `sanitize_path_from_endpoint`
  function fails to properly sanitize Windows-style paths (backward slash `\\`), allowing
  attackers to perform directory traversal attacks on Windows systems. This vulnerability
  can be exploited through various routes, including `personalities` and `/del_preset`,
  to read or delete any file on the Windows filesystem, compromising the system's
  availability."
