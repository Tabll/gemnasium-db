package_slug: "pypi/lollms"
title: "Lollms has an Improper Access Control vulnerability"
description: "A vulnerability in the `lollms_generation_events.py` component of parisneo/lollms
  version 5.9.0 allows unauthenticated access to sensitive Socket.IO events. The `add_events`
  function registers event handlers such as `generate_text`, `cancel_generation`,
  `generate_msg`, and `generate_msg_from` without implementing authentication or authorization
  checks. This allows unauthenticated clients to execute resource-intensive or state-altering
  operations, leading to potential denial of service, state corruption, and race conditions.
  Additionally, the use of global flags (`lollmsElfServer.busy`, `lollmsElfServer.cancel_gen`)
  for state management in a multi-client environment introduces further vulnerabilities,
  enabling one client's actions to affect the server's state and other clients' operations.
  The lack of proper access control and reliance on insecure global state management
  significantly impacts the availability and integrity of the service."
