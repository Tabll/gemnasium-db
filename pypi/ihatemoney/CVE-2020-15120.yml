package_slug: "pypi/ihatemoney"
title: "Authorization Bypass in I hate money"
description: "An authenticated member of one project can modify and delete members
  of another project, without knowledge of this other project's private code. This
  can be further exploited to access all bills of another project without knowledge
  of this other project's private code.\n\nWith the default configuration, anybody
  is allowed to create a new project. An attacker can create a new project and then
  use it to become authenticated and exploit this flaw. As such, the exposure is similar
  to an unauthenticated attack, because it is trivial to become authenticated."
