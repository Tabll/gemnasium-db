package_slug: "pypi/ihatemoney"
title: "Incorrect Authorization"
description: "In \"I hate money\", an authenticated member of one project can modify
  and delete members of another project, without knowledge of this other project's
  private code. This can be further exploited to access all bills of another project
  without knowledge of this other project's private code. With the default configuration,
  anybody is allowed to create a new project. An attacker can create a new project
  and then use it to become authenticated and exploit this flaw. As such, the exposure
  is similar to an unauthenticated attack, because it is trivial to become authenticated.
  This is fixed "
