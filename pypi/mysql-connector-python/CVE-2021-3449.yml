identifier: "CVE-2021-3449"
package_slug: "pypi/mysql-connector-python"
title: "NULL Pointer Dereference"
description: "An OpenSSL TLS server may crash if sent a maliciously crafted renegotiation
  `ClientHello` message from a client. If a TLSv1.2 renegotiation `ClientHello` omits
  the `signature_algorithms` extension (where it was present in the initial `ClientHello`),
  but includes a `signature_algorithms_cert` extension then a NULL pointer dereference
  will result, leading to a crash and a denial of service attack."
