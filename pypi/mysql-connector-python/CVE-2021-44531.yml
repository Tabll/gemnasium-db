identifiers:
- "CVE-2021-44531"
package_slug: "pypi/mysql-connector-python"
title: "Improper Certificate Validation"
description: "Accepting arbitrary Subject Alternative Name (SAN) types, unless a PKI
  is specifically defined to use a particular SAN type, can result in bypassing name-constrained
  intermediates. Node.js < 12.22.9, < 14.18.3, < 16.13.2, and < 17.3.1 was accepting
  URI SAN types, which PKIs are often not defined to use. Additionally, when a protocol
  allows URI SANs, Node.js does not match the URI correctly.Versions of Node.js with
  the fix for this disable the URI SAN type when checking a certificate against a
  hostname. This behavior can be reverted through the --security-revert command-line
  option."
