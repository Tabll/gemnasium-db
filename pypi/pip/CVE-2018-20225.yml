identifier: "CVE-2018-20225"
package_slug: "pypi/pip"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "An issue was discovered in pip (all versions) because it installs the
  version with the highest version number, even if the user had intended to obtain
  a private package from a private index. This only affects use of the `--extra-index-url`
  option, and exploitation requires that the package does not already exist in the
  public index (and thus the attacker can put the package there with an arbitrary
  version number)."
