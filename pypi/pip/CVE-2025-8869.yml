title: "pip's fallback tar extraction doesn't check symbolic links point to extraction
  directory"

  Python’s `tarfile` module without verifying that symbolic/hard link targets resolve
  inside the intended extraction directory. A malicious sdist can include links that
  escape the target directory and overwrite arbitrary files on the invoking host during
  `pip install`."
