title: "Cookie leakage between different users in fastapi-proxy-lib"
description: "### Impact\n\nIn the implementation of version `0.0.1`, requests from
  different user clients are processed using a shared `httpx.AsyncClient`.\n\nHowever,
  one oversight is that the `httpx.AsyncClient` will persistently store cookies based
  on the `set-cookie` response header sent by the target server and share these cookies
  across different user requests.\n\nThis results in a cookie leakage issue among
  all user clients sharing the same `httpx.AsyncClient`.\n\n### Patches\n\nIt's fixed
  in `0.1.0`\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you insist `0.0.1`:\n- Do not use `ForwardHttpProxy`
  at all.\n- Do not use `ReverseHttpProxy` or `ReverseWebSocketProxy` for any servers
  that may potentially send a `set-cookie` response.\n\n**However, it's best to upgrade
  to the latest version.**\n\n### References\n\nfixed in [#10](https://github.com/WSH032/fastapi-proxy-lib/pull/10)
