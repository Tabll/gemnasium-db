title: "jaraco.context Has a Path Traversal Vulnerability"
description: "There is a Zip Slip path traversal vulnerability in the jaraco.context
  package affecting setuptools as well, in `jaraco.context.tarball()` function. The
  vulnerability may allow attackers to extract files outside the intended extraction
  directory when malicious tar archives are processed.\nThe strip_first_component
  filter splits the path on the first `/` and extracts the second component, while
  allowing `../` sequences. Paths like `dummy_dir/../../etc/passwd` become `../../etc/passwd`.\nNote
  that this suffers from a nested tarball attack as well with multi-level tar files
  such as `dummy_dir/inner.tar.gz`, where the inner.tar.gz includes a traversal `dummy_dir/../../config/.env`
  that also gets translated to `../../config/.env`.\n\nThe code can be found:\n- https://github.com/jaraco/jaraco.context/blob/main/jaraco/context/__init__.py#L74-L91\n-
  https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/blob/main/setuptools/_vendor/jaraco/context.py#L55-L76
  (inherited)\n\nThis report was also sent to setuptools maintainers and they asked
  some questions regarding this.\n\nThe lengthy answer is:\n\nThe vulnerability seems
  to be the `strip_first_component` filter function, not the tarball function itself
  and has the same behavior on any tested Python version locally (from 11 to 14, as
  I noticed that there is a backports conditional for the tarball).\nThe stock tarball
  for Python 3.12+ is considered not vulnerable (until proven otherwise 😄) but here
  the custom filter seems to overwrite the native filtering and introduces the issue
  - while overwriting the updated secure Python 3.12+ behavior and giving a false
  sense of sanitization.\n\nThe short answer is:\n\nIf we are talking about Python
  < 3.12 the tarball and jaraco implementations /  behaviors are relatively the same
  but for Python 3.12+ the jaraco implementation overwrites the native tarball protection.\n\nSampled
