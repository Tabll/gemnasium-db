package_slug: "pypi/pyspark"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')"
description: "The Apache Spark UI offers the possibility to enable ACLs via the configuration
  option spark.acls.enable. With an authentication filter, this checks whether a user
  has access permissions to view or modify the application. If ACLs are enabled, a
  code path in HttpSecurityFilter can allow someone to perform impersonation by providing
  an arbitrary user name. A malicious user might then be able to reach a permission
  check function that will ultimately build a Unix shell command based on their input,
  and execute it. This will result in arbitrary shell command execution as the user
  Spark is currently running as. This affects Apache Spark versions 3.0.3 and earlier,
  versions 3.1.1 to 3.1.2, and versions 3.2.0 to 3.2.1."
