identifier: "CVE-2020-9480"
package_slug: "pypi/pyspark"
title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "A standalone resource manager's master may be configured to require
  authentication (`spark.authenticate`) via a shared secret. When enabled, however,
  a specially-crafted RPC to the master can succeed in starting an application's resources
  on the Spark cluster, even without the shared key. This can be leveraged to execute
  shell commands on the host machine. This does not affect Spark clusters using other
  resource managers (YARN, Mesos, etc)."
