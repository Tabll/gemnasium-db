description: "### Impact\n\nThe initial vulnerability identified in Streamlit apps
  using custom components, allowing for directory traversal attacks, was addressed
  in version 1.11.1. However, a minor issue persisted, which could still potentially
  expose certain files on the server file-system under specific conditions.\n\n###
  Patches\n\nWe released an update in version 1.30.0 to further tighten security measures.
  Users are strongly advised to update to version 1.30.0 immediately for optimal security.\n\n###
  Workarounds\n\nNo additional workarounds are necessary once the update to version
  1.30.0 is applied.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments
  about this advisory:\n* Email us at [security@streamlit.io](mailto:security@streamlit.io)"
