package_slug: "pypi/kiwitcms"
title: "No protection against brute-force attacks on login page"
description: "Kiwi TCMS, an open source test management system, does not impose rate
  limits in versions prior to 12.0. This makes it easier to attempt brute-force attacks
  against the login page. Users should upgrade to v12.0 or later to receive a patch.
  As a workaround, users may install and configure a rate-limiting proxy in front
  of Kiwi TCMS."
