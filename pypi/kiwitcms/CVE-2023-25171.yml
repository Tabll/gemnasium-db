package_slug: "pypi/kiwitcms"
title: "Denial of service vulnerability on Password reset page"
description: "Kiwi TCMS, an open source test management system, does not impose rate
  limits in versions prior to 12.0. This makes it easier to attempt denial-of-service
  attacks against the Password reset page. An attacker could potentially send a large
  number of emails if they know the email addresses of users in Kiwi TCMS. Additionally
  that may strain SMTP resources. Users should upgrade to v12.0 or later to receive
  a patch. As potential workarounds, users may install and configure a rate-limiting
  proxy in front of Kiwi TCMS and/or configure rate limits on their email server when
  possible."
