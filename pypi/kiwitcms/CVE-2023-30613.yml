package_slug: "pypi/kiwitcms"
title: "Unrestricted file upload in kiwi TCMS"
description: "Kiwi TCMS allows users to upload attachments to test plans, test cases,
  etc. In earlier versions there is no control over what kinds of files can be uploaded.
  Thus a malicious actor may upload an `.exe` file or a file containing embedded JavaScript
  and trick others into clicking on these files causing vulnerable browsers to execute
  malicious code on another computer or attempting XSS attacks.\n\nStored XSS attacks
  via file uploads have been fixed in earlier versions of Kiwi TCMS, see [GHSA-2wcr-87wf-cf9j](https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/security/advisories/GHSA-2wcr-87wf-cf9j).
  This advisory deals with prohibiting users to upload potentially compromised files
  in the first place."
