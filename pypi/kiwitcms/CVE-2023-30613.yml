title: "Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type"
description: "Kiwi TCMS, an open source test management system, allows users to upload
  attachments to test plans, test cases, etc. In versions of Kiwi TCMS prior to 12.2,
  there is no control over what kinds of files can be uploaded. Thus, a malicious
  actor may upload an `.exe` file or a file containing embedded JavaScript and trick
  others into clicking on these files, causing vulnerable browsers to execute malicious
  code on another computer.\n\nKiwi TCMS v12.2 comes with functionality that allows
  administrators to configure additional upload validator functions which give them
  more control over what file types are accepted for upload. By default `.exe` are
  denied. Other files containing the `<script>` tag, regardless of their type are
  also denied b/c they are a path to XSS attacks. There are no known workarounds aside
  from upgrading."
