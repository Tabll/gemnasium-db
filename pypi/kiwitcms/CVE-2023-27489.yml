package_slug: "pypi/kiwitcms"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "Kiwi TCMS is an open source test management system for both manual and
  automated testing. Kiwi TCMS accepts SVG files uploaded by users which could potentially
  contain JavaScript code. If SVG images are viewed directly, i.e. not rendered in
  an HTML page, this JavaScript code could execute. This vulnerability has been fixed
  by configuring Kiwi TCMS to serve with the `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP header
  which blocks inline JavaScript in all modern browsers. This configuration change
  is provided in version 12.1 and users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade
  may set their `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP header manually."
