package_slug: "pypi/kiwitcms"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "Kiwi TCMS, an open source test management system allows users to upload
  attachments to test plans, test cases, etc. Versions of Kiwi TCMS prior to 12.5
  had introduced changes which were meant to serve all uploaded files as plain text
  in order to prevent browsers from executing potentially dangerous files when such
  files are accessed directly. The previous Nginx configuration was incorrect allowing
  certain browsers like Firefox to ignore the `Content-Type: text/plain` header on
  some occasions thus allowing potentially dangerous scripts to be executed. Additionally,
  file upload validators and parts of the HTML rendering code had been found to require
  additional sanitation and improvements. Version 12.5 fixes this vulnerability with
  updated Nginx content type configuration, improved file upload validation code to
  prevent more potentially dangerous uploads, and Sanitization of test plan names
  used in the `tree_view_html()` function."
