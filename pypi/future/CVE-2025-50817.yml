title: "Python-Future Module Arbitrary Code Execution via Unintended Import of test.py"
description: "A vulnerability in the Python-Future 1.0.0 module allows for arbitrary
  code execution via the unintended import of a file named test.py. When the module
  is loaded, it automatically imports test.py, if present in the same directory or
  in the sys.path. This behavior can be exploited by an attacker who has the ability
  to write files to the server, allowing the execution of arbitrary code."
