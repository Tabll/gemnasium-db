title: "Withdrawn Advisory: Python-Future Module Arbitrary Code Execution via Unintended
  Import of test.py"
description: "## Withdrawn Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it describes
  a documented feature of Python’s import system in the handling of sys.path. For
  more information, see https://github.com/PythonCharmers/python-future/issues/650.\n\n##
  Original Description\n\nA vulnerability in the Python-Future 1.0.0 module allows
  for arbitrary code execution via the unintended import of a file named test.py.
  When the module is loaded, it automatically imports test.py, if present in the same
  directory or in the sys.path. This behavior can be exploited by an attacker who
  has the ability to write files to the server, allowing the execution of arbitrary
  code. NOTE: Multiple third parties have disputed this issue and stated that it is
  not a security flaw in python-future and is a documented feature of Python’s import
  system in the handling of sys.path."
