title: "SignXML's signature verification with HMAC is vulnerable to an algorithm confusion
  attack"
description: "When verifying signatures with X509 certificate validation turned off
  and HMAC shared secret set (`signxml.XMLVerifier.verify(require_x509=False, hmac_key=...`),
  prior versions of SignXML are vulnerable to a potential algorithm confusion attack.
  Unless the user explicitly limits the expected signature algorithms using the `signxml.XMLVerifier.verify(expect_config=...)`
  setting, an attacker may supply a signature unexpectedly signed with a key other
  than the provided HMAC key, using a different (asymmetric key) signature algorithm.\n\nStarting
  with signxml 4.0.4, specifying `hmac_key` causes the set of accepted signature algorithms
  to be restricted to HMAC only, if not already restricted by the user."
