title: "SignXML's signature verification with HMAC is vulnerable to a timing attack"
description: "When verifying signatures with X509 certificate validation turned off
  and HMAC shared secret set (`signxml.XMLVerifier.verify(require_x509=False, hmac_key=...`),
  prior versions of SignXML are vulnerable to a potential timing attack. The verifier
  may leak information about the correct HMAC when comparing it with the user supplied
  hash, allowing users to reconstruct the correct HMAC for any data."
