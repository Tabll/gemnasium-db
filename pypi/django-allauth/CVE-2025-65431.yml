title: "django-allauth's Okta and NetIQ implementations used a mutable identifier
  for authorization decisions"
description: "An issue was discovered in allauth-django before 65.13.0. Both Okta
  and NetIQ were using preferred_username as the identifier for third-party provider
  accounts. That value may be mutable and should therefore be avoided for authorization
  decisions. The providers are now using sub instead."
