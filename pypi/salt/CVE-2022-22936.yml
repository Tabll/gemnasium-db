title: "SaltStack Salt Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay"
description: "An issue was discovered in SaltStack Salt in versions before 3002.8,
  3003.4, 3004.1. Job publishes and file server replies are susceptible to replay
  attacks, which can result in an attacker replaying job publishes causing minions
  to run old jobs. File server replies can also be re-played. A sufficient craft attacker
  could gain root access on minion under certain scenarios."
