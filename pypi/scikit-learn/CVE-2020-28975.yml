title: "scikit-learn Denial of Service"
description: "svm_predict_values in svm.cpp in Libsvm v324, as used in scikit-learn
  0.23.2 and other products, allows attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation
  fault) via a crafted model SVM (introduced via pickle, json, or any other model
  permanence standard) with a large value in the _n_support array.\nNOTE: the scikit-learn
  vendor's position is that the behavior can only occur if the library's API is violated
  by an application that changes a private attribute."
