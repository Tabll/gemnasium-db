title: "scikit-learn Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "scikit-learn (aka sklearn) through 0.23.0 can unserialize and execute
  commands from an untrusted file that is passed to the `joblib.load()` function,
  if `__reduce__` makes an `os.system call`.\nNOTE: third parties dispute this issue
  because the joblib.load() function is documented as unsafe and it is the user's
  responsibility to use the function in a secure manner."
