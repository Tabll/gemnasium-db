title: "scikit-learn sensitive data leakage vulnerability"
description: "A sensitive data leakage vulnerability was identified in scikit-learn's
  TfidfVectorizer, specifically in versions up to and including 1.4.1.post1, which
  was fixed in version 1.5.0. The vulnerability arises from the unexpected storage
  of all tokens present in the training data within the `stop_words_` attribute, rather
  than only storing the subset of tokens required for the TF-IDF technique to function.
  This behavior leads to the potential leakage of sensitive information, as the `stop_words_`
  attribute could contain tokens that were meant to be discarded and not stored, such
  as passwords or keys. The impact of this vulnerability varies based on the nature
  of the data being processed by the vectorizer."
