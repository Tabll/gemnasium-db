package_slug: "pypi/mjml"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "The `mjml` PyPI package, found at the `FelixSchwarz/mjml-python` GitHub
  repo, is an unofficial Python port of MJML, a markup language created by Mailjet.
  All users of `FelixSchwarz/mjml-python` who insert untrusted data into mjml templates
  unless that data is checked in a very strict manner. User input like `&lt;script&gt;`
  would be rendered as `<script>` in the final HTML output. The attacker must be able
  to control some data which is later injected in an mjml template which is then send
  out as email to other users. The attacker could control contents of email messages
  sent through the platform. The problem has been fixed in version 0.11.0 of this
  library. Versions before 0.10.0 are not affected by this security issue. As a workaround,
  ensure that potentially untrusted user input does not contain any sequences which
  could be rendered as HTML."
