package_slug: "pypi/khoj"
title: "Khoj has an IDOR in Notion OAuth Flow that Enables Index Poisoning"
description: "An IDOR in the Notion OAuth callback allows an attacker to hijack any
  user's Notion integration by manipulating the state parameter. The callback endpoint
  accepts any user UUID without verifying the OAuth flow was initiated by that user,
  allowing attackers to replace victims' Notion configurations with their own, resulting
  in data poisoning and unauthorized access to the victim's Khoj search index.\n\nThis
  attack requires knowing the user's UUID which can be leaked through shared conversations
  where an AI generated image is present."
