title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command
  Injection')"
description: "fastbots is a library for fast bot and scraper development using selenium
  and the Page Object Model (POM) design. Prior to version 0.1.5, an attacker could
  modify the locators.ini locator file with python code that without proper validation
  it's executed and it could lead to rce. The vulnerability is in the function `def
  __locator__(self, locator_name: str)` in `page.py`. In order to mitigate this issue,
  upgrade to fastbots version 0.1.5 or above."
