title: "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in strawberry-graphql"
description: "Multipart file upload support as defined in the [GraphQL multipart request
  specification](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec) was
  enabled by default in all Strawberry HTTP view integrations. This made all Strawberry
  HTTP view integrations vulnerable to CSRF attacks if users did not explicitly enable
  CSRF preventing security mechanism for their servers.\nAdditionally, the Django
  HTTP view integration, in particular, had an exemption for Django's built-in CSRF
  protection (i.e., the `CsrfViewMiddleware` middleware) by default.\n\nIn affect,
  all Strawberry integrations were vulnerable to CSRF attacks by default."
