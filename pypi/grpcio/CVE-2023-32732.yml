title: "gRPC connection termination issue"
description: "gRPC contains a vulnerability whereby a client can cause a termination
  of connection between a HTTP2 proxy and a gRPC server: a base64 encoding error for
  `-bin` suffixed headers will result in a disconnection by the gRPC server, but is
  typically allowed by HTTP2 proxies. We recommend upgrading beyond the commit inÂ https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/32309."
