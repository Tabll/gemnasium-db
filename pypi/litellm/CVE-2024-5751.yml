title: "litellm vulnerable to remote code exection base on using eval unsafely"
description: "BerriAI/litellm version v1.35.8 contains a vulnerability where an attacker
  can achieve remote code execution. The vulnerability exists in the `add_deployment`
  function, which decodes and decrypts environment variables from base64 and assigns
  them to `os.environ`. An attacker can exploit this by sending a malicious payload
  to the `/config/update` endpoint, which is then processed and executed by the server
  when the `get_secret` function is triggered. This requires the server to use Google
  KMS and a database to store a model."
