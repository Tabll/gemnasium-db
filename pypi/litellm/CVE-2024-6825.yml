title: "LiteLLM Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE)"
description: "BerriAI/litellm version 1.40.12 contains a vulnerability that allows
  remote code execution. The issue exists in the handling of the 'post_call_rules'
  configuration, where a callback function can be added. The provided value is split
  at the final '.' mark, with the last part considered the function name and the remaining
  part appended with the '.py' extension and imported. This allows an attacker to
  set a system method, such as 'os.system', as a callback, enabling the execution
  of arbitrary commands when a chat response is processed."
