title: "LiteLLM Has an Improper Authorization Vulnerability"
description: "An improper authorization vulnerability exists in the main-latest version
  of BerriAI/litellm. When a user with the role 'internal_user_viewer' logs into the
  application, they are provided with an overly privileged API key. This key can be
  used to access all the admin functionality of the application, including endpoints
  such as '/users/list' and '/users/get_users'. This vulnerability allows for privilege
  escalation within the application, enabling any account to become a PROXY ADMIN."
