title: "SQL injection in litellm"
description: "A blind SQL injection vulnerability exists in the berriai/litellm application,
  specifically within the '/team/update' process. The vulnerability arises due to
  the improper handling of the 'user_id' parameter in the raw SQL query used for deleting
  users. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious SQL commands
  through the 'user_id' parameter, leading to potential unauthorized access to sensitive
  information such as API keys, user information, and tokens stored in the database.
  The affected version is 1.27.14."
