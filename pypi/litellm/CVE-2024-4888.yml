title: "Arbitrary file deletion in litellm"
description: "BerriAI's litellm, in its latest version, is vulnerable to arbitrary
  file deletion due to improper input validation on the `/audio/transcriptions` endpoint.
  An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request
  that includes a file path to the server, which then deletes the specified file without
  proper authorization or validation. This vulnerability is present in the code where
  `os.remove(file.filename)` is used to delete a file, allowing any user to delete
  critical files on the server such as SSH keys, SQLite databases, or configuration
  files."
