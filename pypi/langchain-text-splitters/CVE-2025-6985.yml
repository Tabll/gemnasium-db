title: "LangChain Text Splitters is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks
  due to unsafe XSLT parsing"
description: "The HTMLSectionSplitter class in langchain-text-splitters is vulnerable
  to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks due to unsafe XSLT parsing. This vulnerability
  arises because the class allows the use of arbitrary XSLT stylesheets, which are
  parsed using lxml.etree.parse() and lxml.etree.XSLT() without any hardening measures.
  In lxml versions up to 4.9.x, external entities are resolved by default, allowing
  attackers to read arbitrary local files or perform outbound HTTP(S) fetches. In
  lxml versions 5.0 and above, while entity expansion is disabled, the XSLT document()
  function can still read any URI unless XSLTAccessControl is applied. This vulnerability
  allows remote attackers to gain read-only access to any file the LangChain process
  can reach, including sensitive files such as SSH keys, environment files, source
  code, or cloud metadata. No authentication, special privileges, or user interaction
  are required, and the issue is exploitable in default deployments that enable custom
  XSLT."
