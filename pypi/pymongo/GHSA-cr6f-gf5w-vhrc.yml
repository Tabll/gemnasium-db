title: "PyMongo Out-of-bounds Read in the bson module "
description: "Versions of the package pymongo before 4.6.3 are vulnerable to Out-of-bounds
  Read in the bson module. Using the crafted payload the attacker could force the
  parser to deserialize unmanaged memory. The parser tries to interpret bytes next
  to buffer and throws an exception with string. If the following bytes are not printable
  UTF-8 the parser throws an exception with a single byte.\n\nThis advisory was initially
  published as CVE-2024-21506, which has since been rejected as a duplicate of CVE-2024-5629."
