package_slug: "pypi/aiohttp"
title: "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')"
description: "aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio
  and Python. Security-sensitive parts of the Python HTTP parser retained minor differences
  in allowable character sets, that must trigger error handling to robustly match
  frame boundaries of proxies in order to protect against injection of additional
  requests. Additionally, validation could trigger exceptions that were not handled
  consistently with processing of other malformed input. Being more lenient than internet
  standards require could, depending on deployment environment, assist in request
  smuggling. The unhandled exception could cause excessive resource consumption on
  the application server and/or its logging facilities. This vulnerability exists
  due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2023-47627. Version 3.9.2 fixes this vulnerability."
