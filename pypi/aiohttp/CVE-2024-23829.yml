package_slug: "pypi/aiohttp"
title: "aiohttp's HTTP parser (the python one, not llhttp) still overly lenient about
  separators"
description: "Security-sensitive parts of the *Python HTTP parser* retained minor
  differences in allowable character sets, that must trigger error handling to robustly
  match frame boundaries of proxies in order to protect against injection of additional
  requests. Additionally, validation could trigger exceptions that were not handled
  consistently with processing of other malformed input."
