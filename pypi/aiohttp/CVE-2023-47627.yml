title: "AIOHTTP has problems in HTTP parser (the python one, not llhttp)"
description: "aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio
  and Python. The HTTP parser in AIOHTTP has numerous problems with header parsing,
  which could lead to request smuggling. This parser is only used when AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS
  is enabled (or not using a prebuilt wheel). These bugs have been addressed in commit
  `d5c12ba89` which has been included in release version 3.8.6. Users are advised
  to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for these issues."
