package_slug: "pypi/aiohttp"
title: "Aiohttp has inconsistent interpretation of `Content-Length` vs. `Transfer-Encoding`
  differing in C and Python fallbacks"
description: "Aiohttp has a security vulnerability regarding the inconsistent interpretation
  of the http protocol. As we know that HTTP/1.1 is persistent, if we have both Content-Length(CL)
  and Transfer-Encoding(TE) it can lead to incorrect interpretation of two entities
  that parse the HTTP and we can poison other sockets with this incorrect interpretation.\n\nA
  possible Proof-of-Concept (POC) would be a configuration with a reverse proxy(frontend)
  that accepts both CL and TE headers and aiohttp as backend. As aiohttp parses anything
  with chunked, we can pass a chunked123 as TE, the frontend entity will ignore this
  header and will parse Content-Length. I can give a Dockerfile with the configuration
  if you want.\n\nThe impact of this vulnerability is that it is possible to bypass
  any proxy rule, poisoning sockets to other users like passing Authentication Headers,
  also if it is present an Open Redirect (just like CVE-2021-21330) we can combine
  it to redirect random users to our website and log the request."
