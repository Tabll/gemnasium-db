package_slug: "pypi/aiohttp"
title: "Improper Neutralization"
description: "aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio
  and Python. Affected versions of aiohttp have a security vulnerability regarding
  the inconsistent interpretation of the http protocol. HTTP/1.1 is a persistent protocol,
  if both Content-Length(CL) and Transfer-Encoding(TE) header values are present it
  can lead to incorrect interpretation of two entities that parse the HTTP and we
  can poison other sockets with this incorrect interpretation. A possible Proof-of-Concept
  (POC) would be a configuration with a reverse proxy(frontend) that accepts both
  CL and TE headers and aiohttp as backend. As aiohttp parses anything with chunked,
  we can pass a chunked123 as TE, the frontend entity will ignore this header and
  will parse Content-Length. The impact of this vulnerability is that it is possible
  to bypass any proxy rule, poisoning sockets to other users like passing Authentication
  Headers, also if it is present an Open Redirect an attacker could combine it to
  redirect random users to another website and log the request. This vulnerability
  has been addressed in release 3.8.0 of aiohttp. Users are advised to upgrade. There
  are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
