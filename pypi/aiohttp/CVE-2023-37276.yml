package_slug: "pypi/aiohttp"
title: "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')"
description: "aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio
  and Python. aiohttp v3.8.4 and earlier are bundled with llhttp v6.0.6. Vulnerable
  code is used by aiohttp for its HTTP request parser when available which is the
  default case when installing from a wheel. This vulnerability only affects users
  of aiohttp as an HTTP server (ie `aiohttp.Application`), you are not affected by
  this vulnerability if you are using aiohttp as an HTTP client library (ie `aiohttp.ClientSession`).
  Sending a crafted HTTP request will cause the server to misinterpret one of the
  HTTP header values leading to HTTP request smuggling. This issue has been addressed
  in version 3.8.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade can reinstall
  aiohttp using `AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS=1` as an environment variable to disable the
  llhttp HTTP request parser implementation. The pure Python implementation isn't
  vulnerable."
