title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "OSU Open Source Lab VNCAuthProxy through 1.1.1 is affected by an vncap/vnc/protocol.py
  VNCServerAuthenticator authentication-bypass vulnerability that could allow a malicious
  actor to gain unauthorized access to a VNC session or to disconnect a legitimate
  user from a VNC session. A remote attacker with network access to the proxy server
  could leverage this vulnerability to connect to VNC servers protected by the proxy
  server without providing any authentication credentials. Exploitation of this issue
  requires that the proxy server is currently accepting connections for the target
  VNC server."
