package_slug: "pypi/starlette"
title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "`python-multipart` is a streaming multipart parser for Python. When
  using form data, `python-multipart` uses a Regular Expression to parse the HTTP
  `Content-Type` header, including options. An attacker could send a custom-made `Content-Type`
  option that is very difficult for the RegEx to process, consuming CPU resources
  and stalling indefinitely (minutes or more) while holding the main event loop. This
  means that process can't handle any more requests, leading to regular expression
  denial of service. This vulnerability has been patched in version 0.0.7."
