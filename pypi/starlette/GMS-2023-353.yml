title: "MultipartParser denial of service with too many fields or files"
description: "The MultipartParser using the package python-multipart accepts 
  an unlimited number of multipart parts (form fields or files). Processing too 
  many parts results in high CPU usage and high memory usage, eventually leading 
  to an OOM process kill. This can be triggered by sending too many small form 
  fields with no content, or too many empty files. For this to take effect 
  application code has to; have python-multipart installed and call 
  `request.form()` or via another framework like FastAPI, using form field 
  parameters or UploadFile parameters, which in turn calls `request.form()`."
