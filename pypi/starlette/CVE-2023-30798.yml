title: "MultipartParser denial of service with too many fields or files"
description: "The `MultipartParser` using the package `python-multipart` accepts an
  unlimited number of multipart parts (form fields or files).\n\nProcessing too many
  parts results in high CPU usage and high memory usage, eventually leading to an
  <abbr title=\"out of memory\">OOM</abbr> process kill.\n\nThis can be triggered
  by sending too many small form fields with no content, or too many empty files.\n\nFor
  this to take effect application code has to:\n\n* Have `python-multipart` installed
  and\n* call `request.form()`\n* or via another framework like FastAPI, using form
  field parameters or `UploadFile` parameters, which in turn calls `request.form()`."
