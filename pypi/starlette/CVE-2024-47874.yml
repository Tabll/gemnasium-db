package_slug: "pypi/starlette"
title: "Starlette Denial of service (DoS) via multipart/form-data"
description: "Starlette treats `multipart/form-data` parts without a `filename` as
  text form fields and buffers those in byte strings with no size limit. This allows
  an attacker to upload arbitrary large form fields and cause Starlette to both slow
  down significantly due to excessive memory allocations and copy operations, and
  also consume more and more memory until the server starts swapping and grinds to
  a halt, or the OS terminates the server process with an OOM error. Uploading multiple
  such requests in parallel may be enough to render a service practically unusable,
  even if reasonable request size limits are enforced by a reverse proxy in front
  of Starlette."
