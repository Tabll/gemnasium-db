title: "Browser Use allows bypassing `allowed_domains` by putting a decoy domain in
  http auth username portion of a URL"
description: "During a manual source code review, [**ARIMLABS.AI**](https://arimlabs.ai)
  researchers identified that the `browser_use` module includes an embedded allow list
  functionality to restrict URLs that can be visited. This restriction is enforced

  be bypassed, leading to severe security implications."
