package_slug: "pypi/notebook"
title: "Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')"
description: "Jupyter Notebook is a web-based notebook environment for interactive
  computing. Prior to version 6.4.12, authenticated requests to the notebook server
  with `ContentsManager.allow_hidden = False` only prevented listing the contents
  of hidden directories, not accessing individual hidden files or files in hidden
  directories (i.e. hidden files were 'hidden' but not 'inaccessible'). This could
  lead to notebook configurations allowing authenticated access to files that may
  reasonably be expected to be disallowed. Because fully authenticated requests are
  required, this is of relatively low impact. But if a server's root directory contains
  sensitive files whose only protection from the server is being hidden (e.g. `~/.ssh`
  while serving $HOME), then any authenticated requests could access files if their
  names are guessable. Such contexts also necessarily have full access to the server
  and therefore execution permissions, which also generally grants access to all the
  same files. So this does not generally result in any privilege escalation or increase
  in information access, only an additional, unintended means by which the files could
  be accessed. Version 6.4.12 contains a patch for this issue. There are currently
  no known workarounds."
