package_slug: "pypi/notebook"
title: "Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File"
description: "The Jupyter notebook is a web-based notebook environment for interactive
  computing. Prior to version 6.4.10, unauthorized actors can access sensitive information
  from server logs. Anytime a 5xx error is triggered, the auth cookie and other header
  values are recorded in Jupyter server logs by default. Considering these logs do
  not require root access, an attacker can monitor these logs, steal sensitive auth/cookie
  information, and gain access to the Jupyter server."
