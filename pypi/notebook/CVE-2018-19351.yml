title: "Jupyter Notebook XSS via untrusted notebooks"
description: "Jupyter Notebook before 5.7.1 allows XSS via an untrusted notebook because
  nbconvert responses are considered to have the same origin as the notebook server.
  In other words, nbconvert endpoints can execute JavaScript with access to the server
  API. In notebook/nbconvert/handlers.py, NbconvertFileHandler and NbconvertPostHandler
  do not set a Content Security Policy to prevent this."
