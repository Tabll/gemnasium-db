title: "CodeChecker open redirect when URL contains multiple slashes after the product
  name"
description: "Summary\n---\n\nCodeChecker versions up to 6.24.5 contain an open redirect
  vulnerability due to missing protections against multiple slashes after the product
  name in the URL's path segment.  This results in bypassing protections against CVE-2021-28861,
  leading to the same open redirect pathway.\n\nDetails\n---\n\nCodeChecker processes
  GET requests by first rewriting the path segment of the URL, and then passing the
  rewritten URL to the webserver framework.\nWhen trimming the product name from the
  URL, no sanitization was performed on the remaining URL, which reintroduced the
  same issue as CVE-2021-28861, leading to the same open redirect pathway using URLs
  such as `/Default//attacker.com/%2f..`.\n\nImpact\n---\n\nThe vulnerability allows
  an attacker to create a hyperlink that looks like a legitimate CodeChecker URL,
  but redirects to an attacker-supplied website when clicked."
