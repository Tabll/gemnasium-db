identifier: "CVE-2017-16615"
package_slug: "pypi/mlalchemy"
title: "Code Injection"
description: "An exploitable vulnerability exists in the YAML parsing functionality
  in the `parse_yaml_query` method in `parser.py` in MLAlchemy. When processing YAML-Based
  queries for data, a YAML parser can execute arbitrary Python commands resulting
  in command execution because load is used where safe_load should have been used.
  An attacker can insert Python into loaded YAML to trigger this vulnerability."
