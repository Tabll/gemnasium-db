title: "Litestar's FileStore key canonicalization collisions allow response cache
  mixup/poisoning (ASCII ord + Unicode NFKD)"
description: "FileStore maps cache keys to filenames using Unicode NFKD normalization
  and ord() substitution without separators, creating key collisions. When FileStore
  is used as response-cache backend, an unauthenticated remote attacker can trigger
  cache key collisions via crafted paths, causing one URL to serve cached responses
  of another (cache poisoning/mixup)"
