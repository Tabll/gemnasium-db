title: "Litestar's CORS origin allowlist has a bypass due to unescaped regex metacharacters
  in allowed origins"

  is compiled into a regex without escaping metacharacters (notably .). An allowed
  origin like https://good.example can match https://goodXexample, resulting in Access-Control-Allow-Origin
  being set for an untrusted origin"
