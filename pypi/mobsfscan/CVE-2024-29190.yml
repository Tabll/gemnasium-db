title: "SSRF Vulnerability on assetlinks_check(act_name, well_knowns)"
description: "While examining the \"App Link assetlinks.json file could not be found\"
  vulnerability detected by MobSF, we, as the Trendyol Application Security team,
  noticed that a GET request was sent to the \"/.well-known/assetlinks.json\" endpoint
  for all hosts written with \"android:host\". In the AndroidManifest.xml file.\n\nSince
  MobSF does not perform any input validation when extracting the hostnames in \"android:host\",
  requests can also be sent to local hostnames. This may cause SSRF vulnerability."
