identifier: "CVE-2020-28473"
package_slug: "pypi/bottle"
title: "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests (HTTP Request Smuggling)"
description: "The package bottle from 0 are vulnerable to Web Cache Poisoning by using
  a vector called parameter cloaking. When the attacker can separate query parameters
  using a semicolon (`;`), they can cause a difference in the interpretation of the
  request between the proxy (running with default configuration) and the server. This
  can result in malicious requests being cached as completely safe ones, as the proxy
  would usually not see the semicolon as a separator, and therefore would not include
  it in a cache key of an unkeyed parameter."
