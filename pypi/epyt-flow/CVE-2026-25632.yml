title: "EPyT-Flow vulnerable to unsafe JSON deserialization (__type__)"
description: "EPyT-Flow’s REST API parses attacker-controlled JSON request bodies
  using a custom deserializer (my_load_from_json) that supports a __type__ field.
  When __type__ is present, the deserializer dynamically imports an attacker-specified
  module/class and instantiates it with attacker-supplied arguments. This allows invoking
  dangerous classes such as subprocess.Popen, which can lead to OS command execution
  during JSON parsing. This also affects the loading of JSON files."
