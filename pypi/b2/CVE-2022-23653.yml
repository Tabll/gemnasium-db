title: "Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition"
description: "B2 Command Line Tool is the official command line tool for the backblaze
  cloud storage service. Linux and Mac releases of the B2 command-line tool version
  3.2.0 and below contain a key disclosure vulnerability that, in certain conditions,
  can be exploited by local attackers through a time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU)
  race condition. The command line tool saves API keys (and bucket name-to-id mapping)
  in a local database file (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/b2/account_info`, `~/.b2_account_info`
  or a user-defined path) when `b2 authorize-account` is first run. This happens regardless
  of whether a valid key is provided or not. When first created, the file is world
  readable and is (typically a few milliseconds) later altered to be private to the
  user. If the directory is readable by a local attacker and the user does not yet
  run `b2 authorize-account` then during the brief period between file creation and
  permission modification, a local attacker can race to open the file and maintain
  a handle to it. This allows the local attacker to read the contents after the file
  after the sensitive information has been saved to it. Users that have not yet run
  `b2 authorize-account` should upgrade to B2 Command-Line Tool v3.2.1 before running
  it. Users that have run `b2 authorize-account` are safe if at the time of the file
  creation no other local users had read access to the local configuration file. Users
  that have run `b2 authorize-account` where the designated path could be opened by
  another local user should upgrade to B2 Command-Line Tool v3.2.1 and remove the
  database and regenerate all application keys. Note that `b2 clear-account` does
  not remove the database file and it should not be used to ensure that all open handles
  to the file are invalidated. If B2 Command-Line Tool cannot be upgraded to v3.2.1
  due to a dependency conflict, a binary release can be used instead. Alternatively
  a new version could be installed within a virtualenv, or the permissions can be
  changed to prevent local users from opening the database file."
