title: "MONAI has Path Traversal (Zip Slip) in NGC Private Bundle Download"
description: "A **Path Traversal (Zip Slip)** vulnerability exists in MONAI's `_download_from_ngc_private()`
  function. The function uses `zipfile.ZipFile.extractall()` without path validation,
  while other similar download functions in the same codebase properly use the existing
  `safe_extract_member()` function.\n\nThis appears to be an implementation oversight,
  as safe extraction is already implemented and used elsewhere in MONAI.\n\n**CWE:**
  CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory)\n\n---"
