title: "Monai: Unsafe use of Pickle deserialization may lead to RCE"
description: "The ```pickle_operations``` function in ```monai/data/utils.py``` automatically
  handles dictionary key-value pairs ending with a specific suffix and deserializes
  them using pickle.loads() . This function also lacks any security measures.\n\nWhen
  verified using the following proof-of-concept, arbitrary code execution can occur.\n```"
