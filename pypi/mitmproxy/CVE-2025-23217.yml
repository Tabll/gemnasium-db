title: "Mitmweb API Authentication Bypass Using Proxy Server"
description: "In mitmweb 11.1.0 and below, a malicious client can use mitmweb's proxy
  server (bound to `*:8080` by default) to access mitmweb's internal API (bound to
  `127.0.0.1:8081` by default). In other words, while the client cannot access the
  API directly (good), they can access the API through the proxy (bad). An attacker
  may be able to escalate this [SSRF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side_request_forgery)-style
  access to remote code execution.\n\nThe mitmproxy and mitmdump tools are unaffected.
  Only mitmweb is affected. The `block_global` option, which is enabled by default,
  blocks connections originating from publicly-routable IP addresses in the proxy.
  The attacker needs to be in the same local network."
