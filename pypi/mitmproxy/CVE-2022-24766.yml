title: "Insufficient Protection against HTTP Request Smuggling in mitmproxy"
description: "In mitmproxy 7.0.4 and below, a malicious client or server is able to
  perform [HTTP request smuggling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_request_smuggling)
  attacks through mitmproxy. This means that a malicious client/server could smuggle
  a request/response through mitmproxy as part of another request/response's HTTP
  message body. While mitmproxy would only see one request, the target server would
  see multiple requests. A smuggled request is still captured as part of another request's
  body, but it does not appear in the request list and does not go through the usual
  mitmproxy event hooks, where users may have implemented custom access control checks
  or input sanitization.\n\nUnless you use mitmproxy to protect an HTTP/1 service,
  no action is required."
