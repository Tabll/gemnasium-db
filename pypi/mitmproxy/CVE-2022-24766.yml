title: "Insufficient Protection against HTTP Request Smuggling in mitmproxy"
description: "mitmproxy is an interactive, SSL/TLS-capable intercepting proxy. In
  mitmproxy 7.0.4 and below, a malicious client or server is able to perform HTTP
  request smuggling attacks through mitmproxy. This means that a malicious client/server
  could smuggle a request/response through mitmproxy as part of another request/response's
  HTTP message body. While mitmproxy would only see one request, the target server
  would see multiple requests. A smuggled request is still captured as part of another
  request's body, but it does not appear in the request list and does not go through
  the usual mitmproxy event hooks, where users may have implemented custom access
  control checks or input sanitization. Unless mitmproxy is used to protect an HTTP/1
  service, no action is required. The vulnerability has been fixed in mitmproxy 8.0.0
  and above. There are currently no known workarounds."
