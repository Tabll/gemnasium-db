title: "mitmproxy binaries embed a vulnerable python-hyper/h2 dependency"
description: "mitmproxy 12.1.1 and below embed python-hyper/h2 â‰¤ v4.2.0, which has
  a gap in its HTTP/2 header validation. This enables request smuggling attacks when
  mitmproxy is in a configuration where it translates HTTP/2 to HTTP/1. For example,
  this affects reverse proxies to `http://` backends. It does not affect mitmproxy's
  regular mode.\n\nAll users are encouraged to upgrade to mitmproxy 12.1.2, which
  includes a fixed version of h2.\n\nMore details about the vulnerability itself can
  be found at https://github.com/python-hyper/h2/security/advisories/GHSA-847f-9342-265h."
