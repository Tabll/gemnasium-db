title: "BlackSheep's ClientSession is vulnerable to CRLF injection"
description: "The HTTP Client implementation in BlackSheep is vulnerable to CRLF injection.
  Missing headers validation makes it possible for an attacker to modify the HTTP
  requests (e.g. insert a new header) or even create a new HTTP request.\nExploitation
  requires developers to pass unsanitized user input directly into headers.\nThe server
  part is not affected because BlackSheep delegates to an underlying ASGI server handling
  of response headers.\n\n**Attack vector:** Applications using user input in HTTP
  client requests (method, URL, headers)."
