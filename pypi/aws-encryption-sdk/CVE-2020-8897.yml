package_slug: "pypi/aws-encryption-sdk"
title: "Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm"
description: "A weak robustness vulnerability exists in the AWS Encryption SDKs for
  Java, Python, C and Javalcript Due to the non-committing property of AES-GCM (and
  other AEAD ciphers such as AES-GCM-SIV or (X)ChaCha20Poly1305) used by the SDKs
  to encrypt messages, an attacker can craft a unique cyphertext which will decrypt
  to multiple different results, and becomes especially relevant in a multi-recipient
  setting. We recommend users update their SDK to or later."
