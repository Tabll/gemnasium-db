description: "### Impact\n_Pillow before 8.1.1 allows attackers to cause a denial
  of service  because the reported size of a contained image is
  not properly checked for a BLP container, and thus an attempted memory allocation
  can be very large._\n\n### Patches\n_An issue was discovered in Pillow before 6.2.0.
  When reading specially crafted invalid image files, the library can either allocate
  very large amounts of memory or take an extremely long period of time to process
  the image._\n\n### Workarounds\n_An issue was discovered in Pillow before 6.2.0.
