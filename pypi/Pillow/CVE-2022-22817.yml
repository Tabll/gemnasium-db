title: "Arbitrary expression injection in Pillow"
description: "`PIL.ImageMath.eval` in Pillow before 9.0.0 allows evaluation of arbitrary
  expressions, such as ones that use the Python exec method `ImageMath.eval(\"exec(exit())\")`.\n\nWhile
  Pillow 9.0.0 restricted top-level builtins available to PIL.ImageMath.eval(), it
  did not prevent builtins available to lambda expressions. These are now also restricted
  in 9.0.1."
