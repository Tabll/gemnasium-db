package_slug: "pypi/antilles-tools"
title: "Uncontrolled Search Path Element"
description: "A dependency confusion vulnerability was reported in the Antilles open-source
  software that could allow for remote code execution during installation due to a
  package listed in requirements.txt not existing in the public package index (PyPi).
  MITRE classifies this weakness as an Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427)
  in which a private package dependency may be replaced by an unauthorized package
  of the same name published to a well-known public repository such as PyPi. The configuration
  has been updated to only install components built by Antilles, removing all other
  public package indexes. Additionally, the antilles-tools dependency has been published
  to PyPi."
