package_slug: "pypi/dockerspawner"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "dockerspawner is a tool to spawn JupyterHub single user servers in Docker
  containers. Users of JupyterHub deployments running DockerSpawner starting with
  0.11.0 without specifying `DockerSpawner.allowed_images` configuration allow users
  to launch _any_ pullable docker image, instead of restricting to only the single
  configured image, as intended. This issue has been addressed in commit `3ba4b665b`
  which has been included in dockerspawner release version 13. Users are advised to
  upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should explicitly set `DockerSpawner.allowed_images`
  to a non-empty list containing only the default image will result in the intended
  default behavior."
