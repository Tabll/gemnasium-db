title: "MCP Run Python Deno Sandbox Misconfiguration Allows SSRF Attacks via Localhost
  Access"
description: "**Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**\nA security vulnerability exists
  in the `mcp-run-python` tool (specifically within the Pydantic-AI integration) due
  to an overly permissive Deno sandbox configuration.\n\nThe tool configures the Deno
  runtime—which is intended to isolate the execution of untrusted Python code—with
  network permissions that include access to the host's loopback interface (`localhost`).
  Consequently, malicious Python code executed through the tool can bypass network
  isolation and send HTTP requests to internal services running on the host machine.
  This allows attackers to interact with local APIs, databases, or cloud metadata
  services that should not be accessible from the sandbox."
