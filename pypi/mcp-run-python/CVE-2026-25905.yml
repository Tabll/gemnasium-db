title: "MCP Run Python has a Sandbox Escape & Server Takeover Vulnerability"
description: "**Critical Sandbox Escape & Server Takeover:**\nA critical security
  vulnerability exists in `mcp-run-python` due to a lack of isolation between the
  Python runtime (Pyodide) and the host JavaScript environment.\n\nThe `runPython`
  and `runPythonAsync` functions execute Python code using Pyodide without restricting
  access to the JavaScript bridge. This allows any executed Python code—whether from
  a user or an AI model—to access the `js` module in Pyodide. Through this bridge,
  the Python code can modify the global JavaScript environment, interact with the
  Node.js process, and alter the behavior of the MCP server.\n\n**Specific Attack
  Vector: MCP Tool Shadowing**\nBecause the Python code can modify the JS runtime,
  an attacker can dynamically overwrite or \"shadow\" existing MCP tools registered
  on the server. For example, an attacker could replace a secure file-reading tool
  with a malicious version that exfiltrates data to an external server, all while
  the MCP server appears to be functioning normally."
