title: "Mezzanine CMS has a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the
  displayable_links_js function"
description: "Mezzanine CMS, in versions prior to 6.1.1, contains a Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the admin interface. The vulnerability exists in
  the \"displayable_links_js\" function, which fails to properly sanitize blog post
  titles before including them in JSON responses served via \"/admin/displayable_links.js\".
  An authenticated admin user can create a blog post with a malicious JavaScript payload
  in the title field, then trick another admin user into clicking a direct link to
  the \"/admin/displayable_links.js\" endpoint, causing the malicious script to execute
  in their browser."
