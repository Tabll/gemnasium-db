identifier: "CVE-2020-1740"
package_slug: "pypi/ansible"
title: "Information Exposure"
description: "A flaw was found in Ansible Engine when using Ansible Vault for editing
  encrypted files. When a user executes `ansible-vault edit`, another user on the
  same computer can read the old and new secret, as it is created in a temporary file
  with mkstemp and the returned file descriptor is closed and the method write_data
  is called to write the existing secret in the file. This method will delete the
  file before recreating it insecurely."
