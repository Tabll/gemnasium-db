title: "Code Injection, Race Condition, and Execution with Unnecessary Privileges
  in Ansible"
description: "A flaw was found in Ansible Engine, all versions 2.7.x, 2.8.x and 2.9.x
  prior to 2.7.17, 2.8.11, and 2.9.7 respectively, when using ansible_facts as a subkey
  of itself and promoting it to a variable when inject is enabled, overwriting the
  ansible_facts after the clean. An attacker could take advantage of this by altering
  the ansible_facts, such as ansible_hosts, users and any other key data which would
  lead into privilege escalation or code injection."
