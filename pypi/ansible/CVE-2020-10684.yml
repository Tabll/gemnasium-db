package_slug: "pypi/ansible"
title: "Code Injection"
description: "When using `ansible_facts` as a subkey of itself and promoting it to
  a variable when inject is enabled, overwriting the `ansible_facts` after the clean.
  An attacker could take advantage of this by altering the `ansible_facts`, such as
  `ansible_hosts`, users and any other key data which would lead into privilege escalation
  or code injection."
