title: "Ansible vulnerable to Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere and Insecure Temporary
  File"
description: "A race condition flaw was found in Ansible Engine 2.7.17 and prior,
  2.8.9 and prior, 2.9.6 and prior when running a playbook with an unprivileged become
  user. When Ansible needs to run a module with become user, the temporary directory
  is created in /var/tmp. This directory is created with \"umask 77 && mkdir -p <dir>\";
  this operation does not fail if the directory already exists and is owned by another
  user. An attacker could take advantage to gain control of the become user as the
  target directory can be retrieved by iterating '/proc/<pid>/cmdline'."
