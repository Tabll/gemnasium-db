title: "`Cookie` HTTP header isn't stripped on cross-origin redirects"
description: "urllib3 does not treat the `Cookie` HTTP header special or provide any
  helpers for managing cookies over HTTP, that is the responsibility of the user.
  However, it is possible for a user to specify a `Cookie` header and unknowingly
  leak information via HTTP redirects to a different origin if that user does not
  disable redirects explicitly.\n\nUsers **must** handle redirects themselves instead
  of relying on urllib3's automatic redirects to achieve safe processing of the `Cookie`
  header, thus we decided to strip the header by default in order to further protect
  users who aren't using the correct approach.\n\n## Affected usages\n\nWe believe
  the number of usages affected by this advisory is low. It requires all of the following
  to be true to be exploited:\n\n* Using an affected version of urllib3 (patched in
  v1.26.17 and v2.0.6)\n* Using the `Cookie` header on requests, which is mostly typical
  for impersonating a browser.\n* Not disabling HTTP redirects\n* Either not using
  HTTPS or for the origin server to redirect to a malicious origin.\n\n## Remediation\n\n*
  Upgrading to at least urllib3 v1.26.17 or v2.0.6\n* Disabling HTTP redirects using
  `redirects=False` when sending requests.\n* Not using the `Cookie` header."
