package_slug: "pypi/urllib3"
title: "Authorization Header forwarded on redirect"
description: "urllib3 before 1.24.2 does not remove the authorization HTTP header
  when following a cross-origin redirect (i.e., a redirect that differs in host, port,
  or scheme). This can allow for credentials in the authorization header to be exposed
  to unintended hosts or transmitted in cleartext. NOTE: this issue exists because
  of an incomplete fix for CVE-2018-20060 (which was case-sensitive)."
