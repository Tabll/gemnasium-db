title: "urllib3's request body not stripped after redirect from 303 status changes
  request method to GET"
description: "urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. urllib3 previously
  wouldn't remove the HTTP request body when an HTTP redirect response using status
  301, 302, or 303 after the request had its method changed from one that could accept
  a request body (like `POST`) to `GET` as is required by HTTP RFCs. Although this
  behavior is not specified in the section for redirects, it can be inferred by piecing
  together information from different sections and we have observed the behavior in
  other major HTTP client implementations like curl and web browsers. Because the
  vulnerability requires a previously trusted service to become compromised in order
  to have an impact on confidentiality we believe the exploitability of this vulnerability
  is low. Additionally, many users aren't putting sensitive data in HTTP request bodies,
  if this is the case then this vulnerability isn't exploitable. Both of the following
  conditions must be true to be affected by this vulnerability: 1. Using urllib3 and
  submitting sensitive information in the HTTP request body (such as form data or
  JSON) and 2. The origin service is compromised and starts redirecting using 301,
  302, or 303 to a malicious peer or the redirected-to service becomes compromised.
  This issue has been addressed in versions 1.26.18 and 2.0.7 and users are advised
  to update to resolve this issue. Users unable to update should disable redirects
  for services that aren't expecting to respond with redirects with `redirects=False`
  and disable automatic redirects with `redirects=False` and handle 301, 302, and
  303 redirects manually by stripping the HTTP request body.\n"
