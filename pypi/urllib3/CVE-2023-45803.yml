title: "urllib3's request body not stripped after redirect from 303 status changes
  request method to GET"
description: "urllib3 previously wouldn't remove the HTTP request body when an HTTP
  redirect response using status 303 \"See Other\" after the request had its method
  changed from one that could accept a request body (like `POST`) to `GET` as is required
  by HTTP RFCs. Although the behavior of removing the request body is not specified
  in the section for redirects, it can be inferred by piecing together information
  from different sections and we have observed the behavior in other major HTTP client
  implementations like curl and web browsers.\n\nFrom [RFC 9110 Section 9.3.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-get):\n\n>
  A client SHOULD NOT generate content in a GET request unless it is made directly
  to an origin server that has previously indicated, in or out of band, that such
  a request has a purpose and will be adequately supported."
