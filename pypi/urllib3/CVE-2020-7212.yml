identifier: "CVE-2020-7212"
package_slug: "pypi/urllib3"
title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "The `_encode_invalid_chars` function in `util/url.py` in the urllib3
  library for Python allows a denial of service (CPU consumption) because of an inefficient
  algorithm. The `percent_encodings` array contains all matches of percent encodings.
  It is not deduplicated. For a URL of length N, the size of `percent_encodings` may
  be up to O(N). The next step (normalize existing percent-encoded bytes) also takes
  up to O(N) for each step, so the total time is O(N^2). If `percent_encodings` were
  deduplicated, the time to compute `_encode_invalid_chars` would be O(kN), where
  k is at most ((10+6*2)^2)."
