title: "urllib3 streaming API improperly handles highly compressed data"
description: "urllib3's [streaming API](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/2.5.0/advanced-usage.html#streaming-and-i-o)
  is designed for the efficient handling of large HTTP responses by reading the content
  in chunks, rather than loading the entire response body into memory at once.\n\nWhen
  streaming a compressed response, urllib3 can perform decoding or decompression based
  on the HTTP `Content-Encoding` header (e.g., `gzip`, `deflate`, `br`, or `zstd`).
  The library must read compressed data from the network and decompress it until the
  requested chunk size is met. Any resulting decompressed data that exceeds the requested
  amount is held in an internal buffer for the next read operation.\n\nThe decompression
  logic could cause urllib3 to fully decode a small amount of highly compressed data
  in a single operation. This can result in excessive resource consumption (high CPU
  usage and massive memory allocation for the decompressed data; CWE-409) on the client
  side, even if the application only requested a small chunk of data."
