identifier: "CVE-2021-28363"
package_slug: "pypi/urllib3"
title: "Improper Certificate Validation"
description: "The urllib3 library for Python omits SSL certificate validation in some
  cases involving HTTPS to HTTPS proxies. The initial connection to the HTTPS proxy
  (if an SSLContext isn't given via proxy_config) does not verify the hostname of
  the certificate. This means certificates for different servers that still validate
  properly with the default urllib3 SSLContext will be silently accepted."
