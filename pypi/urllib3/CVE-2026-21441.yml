title: "Decompression-bomb safeguards bypassed when following HTTP redirects (streaming
  API)"
description: "urllib3's [streaming API](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/2.6.2/advanced-usage.html#streaming-and-i-o)
  is designed for the efficient handling of large HTTP responses by reading the content
  in chunks, rather than loading the entire response body into memory at once.\n\nurllib3
  can perform decoding or decompression based on the HTTP `Content-Encoding` header
  (e.g., `gzip`, `deflate`, `br`, or `zstd`). When using the streaming API, the library
  decompresses only the necessary bytes, enabling partial content consumption.\n\nHowever,
  for HTTP redirect responses, the library would read the entire response body to
  drain the connection and decompress the content unnecessarily. This decompression
  occurred even before any read methods were called, and configured read limits did
  not restrict the amount of decompressed data. As a result, there was no safeguard
  against decompression bombs. A malicious server could exploit this to trigger excessive
  resource consumption on the client (high CPU usage and large memory allocations
  for decompressed data; CWE-409)."
