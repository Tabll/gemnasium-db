title: "urllib3 allows an unbounded number of links in the decompression chain"
description: "urllib3 supports chained HTTP encoding algorithms for response content
  according to RFC 9110 (e.g., `Content-Encoding: gzip, zstd`).\n\nHowever, the number
  of links in the decompression chain was unbounded allowing a malicious server to
  insert a virtually unlimited number of compression steps leading to high CPU usage
  and massive memory allocation for the decompressed data."
