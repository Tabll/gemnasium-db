package_slug: "pypi/llama-index-readers-obsidian"
title: "LlamaIndex is vulnerable to Path Traversal attack through its ObsidianReader
  class"
description: "A vulnerability in the `ObsidianReader` class in LlamaIndex Readers
  Integration: Obsidian before version 0.5.1 from the run-llama/llama_index repository
  (versions 0.12.23 to 0.12.28) allows for arbitrary file read through symbolic links.
  The `ObsidianReader` fails to resolve symlinks to their real paths and does not
  validate whether the resolved paths lie within the intended directory. This flaw
  enables attackers to place symlinks pointing to files outside the vault directory,
  which are then processed as valid Markdown files, potentially exposing sensitive
  information."
