title: "LlamaIndex vulnerability in its ObsidianReader class can lead to Path Traversal
  exploit"
description: "A vulnerability in the ObsidianReader class of the run-llama/llama_index
  repository, before version 0.5.2 (specifically in version 0.12.27 of llama-index),
  allows for hardlink-based path traversal. This flaw permits attackers to bypass
  path restrictions and access sensitive system files, such as /etc/passwd, by exploiting
  hardlinks. The vulnerability arises from inadequate handling of hardlinks in the
  load_data() method, where the security checks fail to differentiate between real
  files and hardlinks. This issue is resolved in llama-index-readers-obsidian version
  0.5.2."
