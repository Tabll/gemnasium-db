title: "Label Studio Object Relational Mapper Leak Vulnerability in Filtering Task"
description: "Label Studio is an open source data labeling tool. In all current versions
  of Label Studio prior to 1.9.2post0, the application allows users to insecurely
  set filters for filtering tasks. An attacker can construct a filter chain to filter
  tasks based on sensitive fields for all user accounts on the platform by exploiting
  Django's Object Relational Mapper (ORM). Since the results of query can be manipulated
  by the ORM filter, an attacker can leak these sensitive fields character by character.
  In addition, Label Studio had a hard coded secret key that an attacker can use to
  forge a session token of any user by exploiting this ORM Leak vulnerability to leak
  account password hashes. This vulnerability has been addressed in commit `f931d9d129`
  which is included in the 1.9.2post0 release. Users are advised to upgrade. There
  are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
