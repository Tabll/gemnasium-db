title: "Label Studio allows Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via GET request to `/projects/upload-example`
  endpoint"
description: "Label Studio's `/projects/upload-example` endpoint allows injection
  of arbitrary HTML through a `GET` request with an appropriately crafted `label_config`
  query parameter. By crafting a specially formatted XML label config with inline
  task data containing malicious HTML/JavaScript, an attacker can achieve Cross-Site
  Scripting (XSS). While the application has a Content Security Policy (CSP), it is
  only set in report-only mode, making it ineffective at preventing script execution.\n\nThe
  vulnerability exists because the upload-example endpoint renders user-provided HTML
  content without proper sanitization on a GET request. This allows attackers to inject
  and execute arbitrary JavaScript in victims' browsers by getting them to visit a
  maliciously crafted URL.\n\nThis is considered vulnerable because it enables attackers
  to execute JavaScript in victims' contexts, potentially allowing theft of sensitive
  data, session hijacking, or other malicious actions."
