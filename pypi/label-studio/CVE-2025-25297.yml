title: "Label Studio allows Server-Side Request Forgery in the S3 Storage Endpoint"
description: "Label Studio's S3 storage integration feature contains a Server-Side
  Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in its endpoint configuration. When creating
  an S3 storage connection, the application allows users to specify a custom S3 endpoint
  URL via the s3_endpoint parameter. This endpoint URL is passed directly to the boto3
  AWS SDK without proper validation or restrictions on the protocol or destination.\n\nThe
  vulnerability allows an attacker to make the application send HTTP requests to arbitrary
  internal services by specifying them as the S3 endpoint. When the storage sync operation
  is triggered, the application attempts to make S3 API calls to the specified endpoint,
  effectively making HTTP requests to the target service and returning the response
  in error messages.\n\nThis SSRF vulnerability enables attackers to bypass network
  segmentation and access internal services that should not be accessible from the
  external network. The vulnerability is particularly severe because error messages
  from failed requests contain the full response body, allowing data exfiltration
  from internal services."
