title: "Label Studio is vulnerable to full account takeover by chaining Stored XSS
  + IDOR in User Profile via custom_hotkeys field"
description: "A persistent stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists
  in the custom_hotkeys functionality of the application. An authenticated attacker
  (or one who can trick a user/administrator into updating their custom_hotkeys) can
  inject JavaScript code that executes in other users’ browsers when those users load
  any page using the `templates/base.html` template. Because the application exposes
  an API token endpoint (`/api/current-user/token`) to the browser and lacks robust
  CSRF protection on some API endpoints, the injected script may fetch the victim’s
  API token or call token reset endpoints — enabling full account takeover and unauthorized
  API access. This vulnerability is of critical severity due to the broad impact,
  minimal requirements for exploitation (authenticated user), and the ability to escalate
  privileges to full account compromise."
