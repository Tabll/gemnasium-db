title: "Cross-site Scripting and Open Redirect in plone.app.contenttypes"
description: "Plone is vulnerable to reflected cross site scripting and open 
  redirect when an attacker can get a compromised version of the `image_view_fullscreen`
  page in a cache, for example in Varnish. The technique is known as cache poisoning.
  Any later visitor can get redirected when clicking on a link on this page.
  Usually only anonymous users are affected, but this depends on your cache settings."
