title: "Splash authentication credentials potentially leaked to target websites "
description: "If you use [`HttpAuthMiddleware`](http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#module-scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpauth)
  (i.e. the `http_user` and `http_pass` spider attributes) for Splash authentication,
  any non-Splash request will expose your credentials to the request target. This
  includes `robots.txt` requests sent by Scrapy when the `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting
  is set to `True`."
