title: "OpenStack Keystone token expiration issues"
description: "OpenStack Keystone before 2012.1.1, as used in OpenStack Folsom before
  Folsom-1 and OpenStack Essex, does not properly implement token expiration, which
  allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended authorization restrictions
  by (1) creating new tokens through token chaining, (2) leveraging possession of
  a token for a disabled user account, or (3) leveraging possession of a token for
  an account with a changed password."
