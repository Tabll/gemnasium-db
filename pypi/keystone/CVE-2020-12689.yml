title: "OpenStack Keystone EC2 and/or credential endpoints are not protected from
  a scoped context "
description: "An issue was discovered in OpenStack Keystone before 15.0.1, and 16.0.0.
  Any user authenticated within a limited scope (trust/oauth/application credential)
  can create an EC2 credential with an escalated permission, such as obtaining admin
  while the user is on a limited viewer role. This potentially allows a malicious
  user to act as the admin on a project another user has the admin role on, which
  can effectively grant that user global admin privileges."
