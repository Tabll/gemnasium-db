package_slug: "pypi/keystone"
title: "Insufficiently Protected Credentials"
description: "OpenStack Keystone 15.0.0 and 16.0.0 is affected by Data Leakage in
  the list credentials API. Any user with a role on a project is able to list any
  credentials with the /v3/credentials API when enforce_scope is false. Users with
  a role on a project are able to view any other users' credentials, which could (for
  example) leak sign-on information for Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTP). Deployments
  with enforce_scope set to false are affected. (There will be a slight performance
  impact for the list credentials API once this issue is fixed.)"
