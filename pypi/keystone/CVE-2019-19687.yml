title: "OpenStack Keystone Credential Leakage"
description: "OpenStack Keystone 15.0.0 and 16.0.0 is affected by Data Leakage in
  the list credentials API. Any user with a role on a project is able to list any
  credentials with the `/v3/credentials` API when `enforce_scope` is false. Users
  with a role on a project are able to view any other users' credentials, which could
  (for example) leak sign-on information for Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTP).
  Deployments with enforce_scope set to false are affected. (There will be a slight
  performance impact for the list credentials API once this issue is fixed.)"
