title: "Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity"
description: "pypdf is a pure-python PDF library capable of splitting, merging, cropping,
  and transforming the pages of PDF files. An attacker who uses this vulnerability
  can craft a PDF which leads to unexpected long runtime. This quadratic runtime blocks
  the current process and can utilize a single core of the CPU by 100%. It does not
  affect memory usage. This issue has been addressed in PR 808 and versions from 1.27.9
  include this fix. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for
  this vulnerability."
