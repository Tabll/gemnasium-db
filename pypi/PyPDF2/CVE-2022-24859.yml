package_slug: "pypi/PyPDF2"
title: "Manipulated inline images can cause Infinite Loop in PyPDF2"
description: "PyPDF2 is an open source python PDF library capable of splitting, merging,
  cropping, and transforming the pages of PDF files. In versions prior to 1.27.5 an
  attacker who uses this vulnerability can craft a PDF which leads to an infinite
  loop if the PyPDF2 if the code attempts to get the content stream. The reason is
  that the last while-loop in `ContentStream._readInlineImage` only terminates when
  it finds the `EI` token, but never actually checks if the stream has already ended.
  This issue has been resolved in version `1.27.5`. Users unable to upgrade should
  validate and PDFs prior to iterating over their content stream."
