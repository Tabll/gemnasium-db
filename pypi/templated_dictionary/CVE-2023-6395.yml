package_slug: "pypi/templated_dictionary"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "The Mock software contains a vulnerability wherein an attacker could
  potentially exploit privilege escalation, enabling the execution of arbitrary code
  with root user privileges. This weakness stems from the absence of proper sandboxing
  during the expansion and execution of Jinja2 templates, which may be included in
  certain configuration parameters. While the Mock documentation advises treating
  users added to the mock group as privileged, certain build systems invoking mock
  on behalf of users might inadvertently permit less privileged users to define configuration
  tags. These tags could then be passed as parameters to mock during execution, potentially
  leading to the utilization of Jinja2 templates for remote privilege escalation and
  the execution of arbitrary code as the root user on the build server."
