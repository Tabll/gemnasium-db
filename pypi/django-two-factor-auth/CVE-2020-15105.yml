package_slug: "pypi/django-two-factor-auth"
title: "Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information"
description: "Django Two-Factor Authentication All organizations should encourage
  users whose passwords were insecurely stored to change these passwords on any sites
  where they were used. As a workaround, wwitching Django's session storage to use
  signed cookies instead of the database or cache lessens the impact of this issue,
  but should not be done without a thorough understanding of the security tradeoffs
  of using signed cookies rather than a server-side session storage. There is no way
  to fully mitigate the issue without upgrading."
