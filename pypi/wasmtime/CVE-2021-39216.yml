title: "Use After Free"
description: "Wasmtime is an open source runtime for WebAssembly & WASI. In Wasmtime
  from and there was a use-after-free bug when passing `externref`s from the host
  to guest Wasm content. To trigger the bug, you have to explicitly pass multiple
  `externref`s from the host to a Wasm instance at the same time, either by passing
  multiple `externref`s as arguments from host code to a Wasm function, or returning
  multiple `externref`s to Wasm from a multi-value return function defined in the
  host."
