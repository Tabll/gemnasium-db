title: "Use after free passing `externref`s to Wasm in Wasmtime"
description: "There was a use-after-free bug when passing `externref`s from the host
  to guest Wasm content.\n\nTo trigger the bug, you have to explicitly pass multiple
  `externref`s from the host to a Wasm instance at the same time, either by\n\n* passing
  multiple `externref`s as arguments from host code to a Wasm function,\n* or returning
  multiple `externref`s to Wasm from a multi-value return function defined in the
  host.\n\nIf you do not have host code that matches one of these shapes, then you
  are not impacted."
