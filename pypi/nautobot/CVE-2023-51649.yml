title: "Nautobot missing object-level permissions enforcement when running Job Buttons"
description: "When submitting a Job to run via a Job Button, only the model-level
  `extras.run_job` permission is checked (i.e., does the user have permission to run
  Jobs in general?). Object-level permissions (i.e., does the user have permission
  to run this *specific* Job?) are not enforced by the URL/view used in this case
  (`/extras/job-button/<uuid>/run/`) The effect is that a user with permissions to
  run even a single Job can actually run all configured JobButton Jobs.\n\n> Not all
  Jobs can be configured as JobButtons; only those implemented as subclasses of `JobButtonReceiver`
  can be used in this way, so this vulnerability only applies specifically to `JobButtonReceiver`
  subclasses.\n\nAdditionally, although the documentation states that both `extras.run_job`
  permission and `extras.run_jobbutton` permission must be granted to a user in order
  to run Jobs via JobButton, the `extras.run_jobbutton` permission is not actually
  enforced by the view code, only by the UI by disabling the button from being clicked
  normally. Furthermore, the `extras.run_jobbutton` permission never prevented invoking
  Jobs (including `JobButtonReceiver` subclasses) via the normal \"Job Run\" UI, so
  after some discussion, we've decided that the `extras.run_jobbutton` permission
  is redundant, and as it never achieved its stated/documented purpose, the fixes
  below will remove the UI check for `extras.run_jobbutton` and all other references
  to the `extras.run_jobbutton` permission, rather than adding enforcement of this
  previously unenforced permission."
