package_slug: "pypi/nautobot"
title: "Incorrect Authorization"
description: "Nautobot is a Network Source of Truth and Network Automation Platform
  built as a web application atop the Django Python framework with a PostgreSQL or
  MySQL database. When submitting a Job to run via a Job Button, only the model-level
  `extras.run_job` permission is checked (i.e., does the user have permission to run
  Jobs in general). Object-level permissions (i.e., does the user have permission
  to run this specific Job?) are not enforced by the URL/view used in this case. A
  user with permissions to run even a single Job can actually run all configured JobButton
  Jobs. Fix will be available in Nautobot 1.6.8 and 2.1.0 "
