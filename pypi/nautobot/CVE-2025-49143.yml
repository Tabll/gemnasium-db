package_slug: "pypi/nautobot"
title: "Nautobot may allows uploaded media files to be accessible without authentication"
description: "Files uploaded by users to Nautobot's `MEDIA_ROOT` directory, including
  DeviceType image attachments as well as images attached to a Location, Device, or
  Rack, are served to users via a URL endpoint that was not enforcing user authentication.
  As a consequence, such files can be retrieved by anonymous users who know or can
  guess the correct URL for a given file.\n\nFor DeviceType image attachments, a mitigating
  factor is that no URL endpoint exists for listing the contents of the `devicetype-images/`
  subdirectory, and the file names are as specified by the uploading user, so any
  given DeviceType image attachment can only be retrieved by correctly guessing its
  file name.\n\nSimilarly, for all other image attachments, while the images *can*
  be listed by accessing the `/api/extras/image-attachments/` endpoint *as an authenticated
  user only*, absent that authenticated access, accessing the files would again require
  guessing file names correctly."
