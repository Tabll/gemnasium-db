title: "Nautobot dynamic-group-members doesn't enforce permission restrictions on
  member objects"
description: "_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nA user with
  permissions to view Dynamic Group records (`extras.view_dynamicgroup` permission)
  can use the Dynamic Group detail UI view (`/extras/dynamic-groups/<uuid>/`) and/or
  the members REST API view (`/api/extras/dynamic-groups/<uuid>/members/`) to list
  the objects that are members of a given Dynamic Group.\n\nIn versions of Nautobot
  between 1.3.0 (where the Dynamic Groups feature was added) and 1.6.22 inclusive,
  and 2.0.0 through 2.2.4 inclusive, Nautobot fails to restrict these listings based
  on the member object permissions - for example a Dynamic Group of Device objects
  will list all Devices that it contains, regardless of the user's `dcim.view_device`
  permissions or lack thereof."
