title: "Cross-site Scripting potential in custom links, job buttons, and computed
  fields"
description: "All users of Nautobot versions earlier than 1.6.6 or 2.0.5 are potentially
  affected.\n\nDue to incorrect usage of Django's `mark_safe()` API when rendering
  certain types of user-authored content, including:\n\n- custom links\n- job buttons\n-
  computed fields\n\nit is possible that users with permission to create or edit these
  types of content could craft a malicious payload (such as JavaScript code) that
  would be executed when rendering pages containing this content."
