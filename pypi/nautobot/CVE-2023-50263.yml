package_slug: "pypi/nautobot"
title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "Nautobot is a Network Source of Truth and Network Automation Platform
  built as a web application atop the Django Python framework with a PostgreSQL or
  MySQL database. In Nautobot 1.x and 2.0.x prior to 1.6.7 and 2.0.6, the URLs `/files/get/?name=...`
  and `/files/download/?name=...` are used to provide admin access to files that have
  been uploaded as part of a run request for a Job that has FileVar inputs. Under
  normal operation these files are ephemeral and are deleted once the Job in question
  runs. \n\nIn the default implementation used in Nautobot, as provided by `django-db-file-storage`,
  these URLs do not by default require any user authentication to access; they should
  instead be restricted to only users who have permissions to view Nautobot's `FileProxy`
  model instances.\n\nNote that no URL mechanism is provided for listing or traversal
  of the available file `name` values, so in practice an unauthenticated user would
  have to guess names to discover arbitrary files for download, but if a user knows
  the file name/path value, they can access it without authenticating, so we are considering
  this a vulnerability.\n\nFixes are included in Nautobot 1.6.7 and Nautobot 2.0.6.
  No known workarounds are available other than applying the patches included in those
  versions."
