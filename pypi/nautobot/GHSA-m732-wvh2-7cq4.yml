title: "Unauthenticated views may expose information to anonymous users"
description: "A number of Nautobot URL endpoints were found to be improperly accessible
  to unauthenticated (anonymous) users, including the following:\n\n- `/api/graphql/`
  (1)\n- `/api/users/users/session/` (Nautobot 2.x only; the only information exposed
  to an anonymous user is which authentication backend classes are enabled on this
  Nautobot instance)\n- `/dcim/racks/<uuid:pk>/dynamic-groups/` (1)\n- `/dcim/devices/<uuid:pk>/dynamic-groups/`
  (1)\n- `/extras/job-results/<uuid:pk>/log-table/`\n- `/extras/secrets/provider/<str:provider_slug>/form/`
  (the only information exposed to an anonymous user is the fact that a secrets provider
  with the given slug (e.g. `environment-variable` or `text-file`) is supported by
  this Nautobot instance)\n- `/ipam/prefixes/<uuid:pk>/dynamic-groups/` (1)\n- `/ipam/ip-addresses/<uuid:pk>/dynamic-groups/`
  (1)\n- `/virtualization/clusters/<uuid:pk>/dynamic-groups/` (1)\n- `/virtualization/virtual-machines/<uuid:pk>/dynamic-groups/`
  (1)\n\n(1) These endpoints will not disclose any Nautobot data to an unauthenticated
  user unless the Nautobot configuration variable `EXEMPT_VIEW_PERMISSIONS` is changed
  from its default value (an empty list) to permit access to specific data by unauthenticated
  users.\n\nOf these endpoints, the only one that poses any significant risk of sensitive
  information disclosure under normal Nautobot operation with a default configuration
  is `/extras/job-results/<uuid:pk>/log-table/`. This endpoint returns an HTML table
  containing all of the logs associated with the specified JobResult; while these
  logs may contain sensitive information depending on the Jobs executed in Nautobot,
  this exposure is mitigated somewhat by the fact that any attacker would have to
  have prior knowledge of the existence of a JobResult with a particular UUID.\n\nIn
  the interest of full disclosure, the following additional endpoints were also accessible
  to anonymous users, but do not disclose any sensitive data when accessed (only a
  listing of other API endpoints).\n\n- `/api/`\n- `/api/circuits/`\n- `/api/dcim/`\n-
  `/api/extras/`\n- `/api/ipam/`\n- `/api/plugins/`\n- `/api/tenancy/`\n- `/api/users/`\n-
  `/api/virtualization/`\n\nAll of the above endpoints have been corrected to require
  user authentication, with the exception of `/api/users/users/session/` which is
  unused at this time and therefore has been simply removed from Nautobot 2.1.9. Additionally,
  we have added test automation which enumerates available Nautobot URL endpoints
  and verifies that appropriate authentication requirements are in place; this test
  was instrumental in identifying the above comprehensive list."
