title: "Nautobot vulnerable to secrets exposure and data manipulation through Jinja2
  templating"
description: "_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nAll users of
  Nautobot versions prior to 2.4.10 or prior to 1.6.32 are potentially affected.\n\nDue
  to insufficient security configuration of the Jinja2 templating feature used in
  computed fields, custom links, etc. in Nautobot:\n\n1. A malicious user could configure
  this feature set in ways that could expose the value of Secrets defined in Nautobot
  when the templated content is rendered.\n2. A malicious user could configure this
  feature set in ways that could call Python APIs to modify data within Nautobot when
  the templated content is rendered, bypassing the object permissions assigned to
  the viewing user."
