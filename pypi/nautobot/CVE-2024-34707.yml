title: "Nautobot's BANNER_* configuration can be used to inject arbitrary HTML content
  into Nautobot pages"
description: "A Nautobot user with admin privileges can modify the `BANNER_TOP`, `BANNER_BOTTOM`,
  and `BANNER_LOGIN` configuration settings via the `/admin/constance/config/` endpoint.
  Normally these settings are used to provide custom banner text at the top and bottom
  of all Nautobot web pages (or specifically on the login page in the case of `BANNER_LOGIN`)
  but it was reported that an admin user can make use of these settings to inject
  arbitrary HTML, potentially exposing Nautobot users to security issues such as cross-site
  scripting (stored XSS)."
