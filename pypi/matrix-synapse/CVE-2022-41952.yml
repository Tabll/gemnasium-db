package_slug: "pypi/matrix-synapse"
title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "Synapse before 1.52.0 with URL preview functionality enabled will attempt
  to generate URL previews for media stream URLs without properly limiting connection
  time. Connections will only be terminated after `max_spider_size` (default: 10M)
  bytes have been downloaded, which can in some cases lead to long-lived connections
  towards the streaming media server (for instance, Icecast). This can cause excessive
  traffic and connections toward such servers if their stream URL is, for example,
  posted to a large room with many Synapse instances with URL preview enabled. Version
  1.52.0 implements a timeout mechanism which will terminate URL preview connections
  after 30 seconds. Since generating URL previews for media streams is not supported
  and always fails, 1.53.0 additionally implements an allow list for content types
  for which Synapse will even attempt to generate a URL preview. Upgrade to 1.53.0
  to fully resolve the issue. As a workaround, turn off URL preview functionality
  by setting `url_preview_enabled: false` in the Synapse configuration file."
