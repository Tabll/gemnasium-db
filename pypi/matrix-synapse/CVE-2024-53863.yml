- "GHSA-vp6v-whfm-rv3g"
package_slug: "pypi/matrix-synapse"
title: "Synapse can be forced to thumbnail unexpected file formats, invoking external,
  potentially untrustworthy decoders"
description: "In Synapse versions before 1.120.1, enabling the `dynamic_thumbnails`
  option or processing a specially crafted request could trigger the decoding and
  thumbnail generation of uncommon image formats, potentially invoking external tools
  like Ghostscript for processing.\n\nThis significantly expands the attack surface
  in a historically vulnerable area, presenting a risk that far outweighs the benefit,
  particularly since these formats are rarely used on the open web or within the Matrix
  ecosystem.\n\nFor a list of image formats, as well as decoding libraries and helper
  programs used, see [the Pillow documentation](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/handbook/image-file-formats.html)."
