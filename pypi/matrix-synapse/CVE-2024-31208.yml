title: "Synapse V2 state resolution weakness allows Denial of Service (DoS)"
description: "A remote Matrix user with malicious intent, sharing a room with Synapse
  instances before 1.105.1, can dispatch specially crafted events to exploit a weakness

  and accumulate excessive data in the database of such instances, resulting in a
  denial of service.\n\nServers in private federations, or those that do not federate,
  are not affected."
