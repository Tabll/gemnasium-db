package_slug: "pypi/matrix-synapse"
title: "Synapse's unauthenticated writes to the media repository allow planting of
  problematic content"
description: "Synapse before version 1.106 allows, by design, unauthenticated remote
  participants to trigger a download and caching of remote media from a remote homeserver
  to the local media repository. Such content then also becomes available for download
  from the local homeserver in an unauthenticated way. The implication is that unauthenticated
  remote adversaries can use this functionality to plant problematic content into
  the media repository."
