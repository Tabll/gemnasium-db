identifier: "CVE-2021-21393"
package_slug: "pypi/matrix-synapse"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package
  matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and
  VoIP. Synapse is missing input validation of some parameters on the endpoints
  used to confirm third-party identifiers. This could cause excessive use of disk space
  and memory leading to resource exhaustion. Note that the groups feature is not part
  of the Matrix specification and the chosen maximum lengths are arbitrary. Not all
  clients might abide by them."
