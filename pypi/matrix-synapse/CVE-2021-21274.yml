- "GHSA-2hwx-mjrm-v3g8"
package_slug: "pypi/matrix-synapse"
title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package
  matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and
  VoIP. In Synapse, a malicious homeserver could redirect requests to their `.well-known`
  file to a large file. This can lead to a denial of service attack where homeservers
  will consume significantly more resources when requesting the `.well-known` file
  of a malicious homeserver. This affects any server which accepts federation requests
  from untrusted servers. As a workaround, the `federation_domain_allow list` setting
  can be used to restrict the homeservers communicated with over federation."
