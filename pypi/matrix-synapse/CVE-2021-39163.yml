title: "Adding a private/unlisted room to a community exposes room metadata in an
  unauthorised manner."
description: "Unauthorised users can access the name, avatar, topic and number of
  members of a room if they know the ID of the room. This vulnerability is limited
  to homeservers where:\n- the vulnerable homeserver is in the room; and\n- untrusted
  users are permitted to create groups (communities).\n\nBy default, only homeserver
  administrators can create groups. However, homeserver administrators can already
  access this information in the database or using the admin API. As a result, only
  homeservers where the configuration setting `enable_group_creation` has been set
  to `true` are impacted."
