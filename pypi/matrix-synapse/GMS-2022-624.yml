title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "Synapse before 1.52.0 with URL preview functionality enabled
  will attempt to generate URL previews for media stream URLs without properly limiting
  connection time. Connections will only be terminated after `max_spider_size` (default:
  10M) bytes have been downloaded, which can in some cases lead to long-lived connections
  towards the streaming media server (for instance, Icecast). This can cause excessive
  traffic and connections toward such servers if their stream URL is, for example,
  posted to a large room with many Synapse instances with URL preview enabled."
