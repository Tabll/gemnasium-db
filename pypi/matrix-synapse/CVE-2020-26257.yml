identifier: "CVE-2020-26257"
package_slug: "pypi/matrix-synapse"
title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "Synapse is a reference homeserver implementation of Matrix. A malicious
  or poorly-implemented homeserver can inject malformed events into a room by specifying
  a different room id in the path of a `/send_join`, `/send_leave`, `/invite` or `/exchange_third_party_invite`
  request. This can lead to a denial of service in which future events will not be
  correctly sent to other servers over federation. This affects any server which accepts
  federation requests from untrusted servers."
