identifier: "CVE-2021-29471"
package_slug: "pypi/matrix-synapse"
title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python. Matrix 
  is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse 
  `Push rules` can specify conditions under which they will match, including 
  `event_match`, which matches event content against a pattern including
  wildcards. Certain patterns can cause very poor performance in the matching engine,
  leading to a denial-of-service when processing moderate length events. The issue
  is patched A potential workaround might be to prevent users from making custom push
  rules, by blocking such requests at a reverse-proxy."
