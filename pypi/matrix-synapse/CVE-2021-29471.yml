title: "Denial of service attack via push rule patterns in matrix-synapse"
description: "\"Push rules\" can specify [conditions](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.6.1#conditions)
  under which they will match, including `event_match`, which matches event content
  against a pattern including wildcards.\n\nCertain patterns can cause very poor performance
  in the matching engine, leading to a denial-of-service when processing moderate
  length events."
