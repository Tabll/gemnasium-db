title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python. Matrix is
  an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse `Push rules`
  can specify conditions under which they will match, including `event_match`, which
  matches event content against a pattern including wildcards. Certain patterns can
  cause very poor performance in the matching engine, leading to a denial-of-service
  when processing moderate length events. The issue is patched A potential workaround
  might be to prevent users from making custom push rules, by blocking such requests
  at a reverse-proxy."
