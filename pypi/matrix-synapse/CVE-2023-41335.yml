package_slug: "pypi/matrix-synapse"
title: "matrix-synapse vulnerable to temporary storage of plaintext passwords during
  password changes"
description: "### Impact\n\nWhen users update their passwords, the new credentials
  may be briefly held in the server database. While this does not grant the server
  any added capabilities—it already learns the users' passwords as part of the authentication
  process—it does disrupt the expectation that passwords won't be stored in the database.
  As a result, these passwords could inadvertently be captured in database backups
  for a longer duration.\n\nThese temporarily stored passwords are automatically erased
  after a 48-hour window.\n\n### Patches\nhttps://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/16272\n\n###
  References\n\nThis bug was due to a regression in https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/13188."
