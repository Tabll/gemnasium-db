package_slug: "pypi/matrix-synapse"
title: "URL Redirection to Untrusted Site (Open Redirect)"
description: "Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package
  matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and
  VoIP. In Synapse, requests to user provided domains were not restricted to external
  IP addresses when calculating the key validity for third-party invite events and
  sending push notifications. This could cause Synapse to make requests to internal
  infrastructure. The type of request was not controlled by the user, although limited
  modification of request bodies was possible. For the most thorough protection server
  administrators should remove the deprecated `federation_ip_range_blacklist` from
  their settings after upgrading to Synapse v1.25.0 which will result in Synapse using
  the improved default IP address restrictions. See the new `ip_range_blacklist` and
  `ip_range_whitelist` settings if more specific control is necessary."
