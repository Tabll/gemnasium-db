package_slug: "pypi/jupyterhub-firstuseauthenticator"
title: "Improper Access Control"
description: "FirstUseAuthenticator is a JupyterHub authenticator that helps new users
  set their password on their first login to JupyterHub. When JupyterHub is used with
  FirstUseAuthenticator, a vulnerability allows unauthorized access to any user's
  account if `create_users=True` and the username is known or guessed. One may upgrade
  to or apply a patch manually to mitigate the vulnerability. For those who cannot
  upgrade, there is no complete workaround, but a partial mitigation exists. One can
  disable user creation with `c.FirstUseAuthenticator.create_users = False`, which
  will only allow login with fully normalized usernames for already existing users
  prior to jupyterhub-firstuserauthenticat If any users have never logged in with
  their normalized username (i.e. lowercase), they will still be vulnerable until
  a patch or upgrade occurs."
