title: "NULL Pointer Dereference"
description: "There is a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in VTK, and it lies
  in IO/Infovis/vtkXMLTreeReader.cxx. The vendor didn't check the return value of
  libxml2 API 'xmlDocGetRootElement', and try to dereference it. It is unsafe as the
  return value can be NULL and that NULL pointer dereference may crash the application."
