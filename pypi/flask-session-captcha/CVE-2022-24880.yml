title: "Potential Captcha Validate Bypass in flask-session-captcha"
description: "flask-session-captcha is a package which allows users to extend Flask
  by adding an image based captcha stored in a server side session.\n\nThe `captcha.validate()`
  function would return `None` if passed no value (e.g. by submitting a request with
  an empty form).\n\nIf implementing users were checking the return value to be **False**,
  the captcha verification check could be bypassed.\n\nSample vulnerable code:\n```python\nif
  captcha.validate() == False:\n... # abort\nelse:\n... # do stuff\n```"
