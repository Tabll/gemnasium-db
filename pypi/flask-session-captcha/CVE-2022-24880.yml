title: "Potential Captcha Validate Bypass in flask-session-captcha"
description: "flask-session-captcha is a package which allows users to extend Flask
  by adding an image based captcha stored in a server side session. In versions prior
  to 1.2.1, the `captcha.validate()` function would return `None` if passed no value
  (e.g. by submitting an having an empty form). If implementing users were checking
  the return value to be **False**, the captcha verification check could be bypassed.
  Version 1.2.1 fixes the issue. Users can workaround the issue by not explicitly
  checking that the value is False. Checking the return value less explicitly should
  still work."
