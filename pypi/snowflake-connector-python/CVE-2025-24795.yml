title: "snowflake-connector-python vulnerable to insecure cache files permissions"
description: "### Issue\nSnowflake discovered and remediated a vulnerability in the
  Snowflake Connector for Python. On Linux systems, when temporary credential caching
  is enabled, the Snowflake Connector for Python will cache temporary credentials
  locally in a world-readable file.\n\nThis vulnerability affects versions 2.3.7 through
  3.13.0. Snowflake fixed the issue in version 3.13.1.\n\n### Vulnerability Details\nOn
  Linux, when either EXTERNALBROWSER or USERNAME_PASSWORD_MFA authentication methods
  are used with temporary credential caching enabled, the Snowflake Connector for
  Python will cache the temporary credentials in a local file. In the vulnerable versions
  of the Driver, this file is created with world-readable permissions.\n\n### Solution\nSnowflake
  released version 3.13.1 of the Snowflake Connector for Python, which fixes this
  issue. We recommend users upgrade to version 3.13.1.\n\n### Additional Information\nIf
  you discover a security vulnerability in one of our products or websites, please
  report the issue to HackerOne. For more information, please see our [Vulnerability
  Disclosure Policy](https://hackerone.com/snowflake?type=team)."
