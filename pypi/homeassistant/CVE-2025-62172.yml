title: "Home Assistant has Stored XSS vulnerability in Energy dashboard from Energy
  Entity Name"
description: "An authenticated party can add a malicious name to the Energy entity,
  allowing for Cross-Site Scripting attacks against anyone who can see the Energy
  dashboard, when they hover over any information point (The blue bar in the picture
  below)\n<img width=\"955\" height=\"568\" alt=\"1_cens\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed855216-c306-4b50-affc-cda100e72b74\"

  and gets exploited that way, through the default name."
