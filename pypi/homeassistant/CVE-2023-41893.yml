package_slug: "pypi/homeassistant"
title: "Home Assistant vulnerable to account takeover via auth_callback login"
description: "Home assistant is an open source home automation. The audit team’s analyses
  confirmed that the `redirect_uri` and `client_id` are alterable when logging in.
  Consequently, the code parameter utilized to fetch the `access_token` post-authentication
  will be sent to the URL specified in the aforementioned parameters. Since an arbitrary
  URL is permitted and `homeassistant.local` represents the preferred, default domain
  likely used and trusted by many users, an attacker could leverage this weakness
  to manipulate a user and retrieve account access. Notably, this attack strategy
  is plausible if the victim has exposed their Home Assistant to the Internet, since
  after acquiring the victim’s `access_token` the adversary would need to utilize
  it directly towards the instance to achieve any pertinent malicious actions. To
  achieve this compromise attempt, the attacker must send a link with a `redirect_uri`
  that they control to the victim’s own Home Assistant instance. In the eventuality
  the victim authenticates via said link, the attacker would obtain code sent to the
  specified URL in `redirect_uri`, which can then be leveraged to fetch an `access_token`.
  Pertinently, an attacker could increase the efficacy of this strategy by registering
  a near identical domain to `homeassistant.local`, which at first glance may appear
  legitimate and thereby obfuscate any malicious intentions. This issue has been addressed
  in version 2023.9.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
  for this vulnerability."
