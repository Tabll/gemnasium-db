package_slug: "pypi/homeassistant"
title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "Home Assistant is open source home automation software. Prior to version
  2023.12.3, the login page discloses all active user accounts to any unauthenticated
  browsing request originating on the Local Area Network. Version 2023.12.3 contains
  a patch for this issue.\n\nWhen starting the Home Assistant 2023.12 release, the
  login page returns all currently active user accounts to browsing requests from
  the Local Area Network. Tests showed that this occurs when the request is not authenticated
  and the request originated locally, meaning on the Home Assistant host local subnet
  or any other private subnet. The rationale behind this is to make the login more
  user-friendly and an experience better aligned with other applications that have
  multiple user-profiles.\n\nHowever, as a result, all accounts are displayed regardless
  of them having logged in or not and for any device that navigates to the server.
  This disclosure is mitigated by the fact that it only occurs for requests originating
  from a LAN address. But note that this applies to the local subnet where Home Assistant
  resides and to any private subnet that can reach it."
