title: "MCP Python SDK has Unhandled Exception in Streamable HTTP Transport, Leading
  to Denial of Service"
description: "If a client deliberately triggers an exception after establishing a
  streamable HTTP session, this can lead to an uncaught ClosedResourceError on the
  server side, causing the server to crash and requiring a restart to restore service.
  Impact may vary depending on the deployment conditions, and presence of infrastructure-level
  resilience measures.\n\nThank you to Rich Harang for reporting this issue."
