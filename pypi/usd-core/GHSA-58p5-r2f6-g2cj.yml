title: "Pixar OpenUSD Sdf_PathNode Module Use-After-Free Vulnerability Leading to
  Potential Remote Code Execution"
description: "A Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerability has been discovered in the Sdf_PathNode
  module of the Pixar OpenUSD library. This issue occurs during the deletion of the
  Sdf_PrimPathNode object in multi-threaded environments, where freed memory is accessed.
  This results in segmentation faults or bus errors, allowing attackers to potentially
  exploit the vulnerability for remote code execution (RCE). By using a specially
  crafted .usd file, an attacker could gain control of the affected system. The vulnerability
  has been confirmed in multiple OpenUSD tools, including sdfdump, usdtree, usdcat,
  and sdffilter."
