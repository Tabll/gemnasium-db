package_slug: "pypi/requests"
title: "Requests `Session` object does not verify requests after making first request
  with verify=False"
description: "When using a `requests.Session`, if the first request to a given origin
  is made with `verify=False`, TLS certificate verification may remain disabled for
  all subsequent requests to that origin, even if `verify=True` is explicitly specified
  later.\n\nThis occurs because the underlying connection is reused from the session's
  connection pool, causing the initial TLS verification setting to persist for the
  lifetime of the pooled connection. As a result, applications may unintentionally
  send requests without certificate verification, leading to potential man-in-the-middle
  attacks and compromised confidentiality or integrity.\n\nThis behavior affects versions
  of `requests` prior to 2.32.0."
