identifier: "CVE-2015-2296"
package_slug: "pypi/requests"
title: "Session fixation in resolve_redirects()"
description: "The `resolve_redirects()` function in `sessions.py` allows a remote,
  user-assisted attacker to conduct a session fixation attack. This flaw exists because
  the application, when establishing a new session, does not invalidate an existing
  session identifier and assign a new one. With a specially crafted request fixating
  the session identifier, a context-dependent attacker can ensure a user authenticates
  with the known session identifier, allowing the session to be subsequently hijacked."
