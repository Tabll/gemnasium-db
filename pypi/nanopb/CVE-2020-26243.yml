package_slug: "pypi/nanopb"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "Nanopb is a small code-size Protocol Buffers implementation. The following
  workarounds are available: 1) Set the option `no_unions` for the oneof field. This
  will generate fields as separate instead of C union, and avoids triggering the problematic
  code. 2) Set the type of the submessage field inside oneof to `FT_POINTER`. This
  way the whole submessage will be dynamically allocated and the problematic code
  is not executed. 3) Use an arena allocator for nanopb, to make sure all memory can
  be released afterwards."
