package_slug: "pypi/nanopb"
title: "nanopb vulnerable to invalid free() call with oneofs and PB_ENABLE_MALLOC"
description: "Decoding a specifically formed message can cause invalid `free()` or
  `realloc()` calls if the message type contains an `oneof` field, and the `oneof`
  directly contains both a pointer field and a non-pointer field. If the message data
  first contains the non-pointer field and then the pointer field, the data of the
  non-pointer field is incorrectly treated as if it was a pointer value. Such message
  data rarely occurs in normal messages, but it is a concern when untrusted data is
  parsed."
