title: "Werkzeug possible resource exhaustion when parsing file data in forms"
description: "Applications using Werkzeug to parse `multipart/form-data` requests
  are vulnerable to resource exhaustion. A specially crafted form body can bypass
  the `Request.max_form_memory_size` setting.\n\n\nThe `Request.max_content_length`
  setting, as well as resource limits provided by deployment software and platforms,
  are also available to limit the resources used during a request. This vulnerability
  does not affect those settings. All three types of limits should be considered and
  set appropriately when deploying an application."
