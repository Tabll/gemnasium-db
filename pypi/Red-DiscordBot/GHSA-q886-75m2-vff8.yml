title: "Duplicate Advisory: Unauthorized privilege escalation in Mod module"
description: "# Duplicate Advisory\n\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it
  is a duplicate of GHSA-mp9m-g7qj-6vqr. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n# Original Description\n\nRed Discord Bot before version 3.4.1 has
  an unauthorized privilege escalation exploit in the Mod module. This exploit allows
  Discord users with a high privilege level within the guild to bypass hierarchy checks
  when the application is in a specific condition that is beyond that user's control.
  By abusing this exploit, it is possible to perform destructive actions within the
  guild the user has high privileges in. This exploit has been fixed in version 3.4.1.
  As a workaround, unloading the Mod module with unload mod or, disabling the massban
  command with command disable global massban can render this exploit not accessible.
  We still highly recommend updating to 3.4.1 to completely patch this issue."
