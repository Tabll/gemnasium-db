title: "Code Injection"
description: "Red Discord Bot has a Remote Code Execution vulnerability in the Streams
  module. This exploit allows Discord users with specifically crafted \"going live\"
  messages to inject code into the Streams module's going live message. By abusing
  this exploit, it's possible to perform destructive actions and/or access sensitive
  information. As a workaround, unloading the Trivia module with `unload streams`
  can render this exploit not accessible."
