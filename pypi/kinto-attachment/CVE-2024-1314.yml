package_slug: "pypi/kinto-attachment"
title: "Kinto Attachment's attachments can be replaced on read-only records"
description: "### Impact\n\nThe attachment file of an existing record can be replaced
  if the user has `\"read\"` permission on one of the parent (collection or bucket).\n\nAnd
  if the `\"read\"` permission is given to `\"system.Everyone\"` on one of the parent,
  then the attachment can be replaced on a record using an anonymous request.\n\nNote
  that if the parent has no explicit read permission, then the records attachments
  are safe.\n\n### Patches\n\n- Patch released in kinto-attachment 6.4.0\n- https://github.com/Kinto/kinto-attachment/commit/f4a31484f5925cbc02b59ebd37554538ab826ca1\n\n###
  Workarounds\n\nNone if the read permission has to remain granted.\n\nUpdating to
  6.4.0 or applying the patch individually (if updating is not feasible) is strongly
  recommended.\n\n### References\n\n- https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1879034"
