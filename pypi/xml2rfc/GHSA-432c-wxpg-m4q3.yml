title: "xml2rfc has file inclusion irregularities"
description: "Version [3.12.0](https://github.com/ietf-tools/xml2rfc/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#3120---2021-12-08)
  changed `xml2rfc` so that it would not access local files without the presence of
  its new `--allow-local-file-access` flag.\nThis prevented XML External Entity (XXE)
  injection attacks with `xinclude` and XML entity references.\n\nIt was discovered
  that `xml2rfc` does not respect `--allow-local-file-access` when a local file is
  specified as `src` in `artwork` or `sourcecode` elements. Furthermore, XML entity
  references can include any file inside the source dir and below without using the
  `--allow-local-file-access` flag.\n\nThe `xml2rfc <= 3.26.0` behaviour:\n\n|  |
  `xinclude` | XML entity reference | `artwork src=` | `sourcecode src=` |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|
  without `--allow-local-file-access` flag | No filesystem access | Any file in xml2rfc
  templates dir and below, any file in source directory and below | Access source
  directory and below | Access source directory and below |\n| with `--allow-local-file-access`
  flag | Access any file on filesystem[^1] | Access any file on filesystem[^1] | Access
  source directory and below | Access source directory and below | Access source directory
  and below |\n\n[^1]: Access any file of the filesystem with the permissions of the
  user running `xml2rfc` can access."
