identifier: "CVE-2020-26263"
package_slug: "pypi/tlslite-ng"
title: "Inadequate Encryption Strength"
description: "tlslite-ng is an open source python library that implements SSL and
  TLS cryptographic protocols. In tlslite-ng, the code that performs decryption and
  padding check in RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 decryption is data dependant. In particular, the
  code has multiple ways in which it leaks information about the decrypted ciphertext.
  It aborts as soon as the plaintext does not start with All TLS servers that enable
  RSA key exchange as well as applications that use the RSA decryption API directly
  are vulnerable. This is patched . Note: the patches depend on Python processing
  the individual bytes in side-channel free manner, this is known to not the case
  (see reference). As such, users that require side-channel resistance are recommended
  to use different TLS implementations, as stated in the security policy of tlslite-ng."
