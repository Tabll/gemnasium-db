title: "OpaMiddleware does not filter HTTP OPTIONS requests"
description: "HTTP `OPTIONS` requests are always allowed by `OpaMiddleware`, even
  when they lack authentication, and are passed through directly to the application.\n\nThe
  maintainer uncertain whether this should be classed as a \"bug\" or \"security issue\"
  â€“ but is erring on the side of \"security issue\" as an application could reasonably
  assume OPA controls apply to *all* HTTP methods, and it bypasses more sophisticated
  policies."
