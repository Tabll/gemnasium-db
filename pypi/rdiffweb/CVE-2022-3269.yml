package_slug: "pypi/rdiffweb"
title: "rdiffweb vulnerable to account access via session fixation"
description: "rdiffweb prior to 2.4.7 fails to invalidate session cookies on logout,
  leading to session fixation and allowing an attacker to access a users account.
  After logging in and logging out, the application continues to use the preauthentication
  cookies. The cookies remain the same after closing the browser and after password
  reset. The same cookies are reassigned for additional user logins which can lead
  to session fixation. An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the account of
  users who are using the same browser as long as a single session cookie persists
  on that browser once the attacker obtains a session cookie through another attack.
  This issue is patched in version 2.4.7. There are no known workarounds."
