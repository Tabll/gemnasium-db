title: "Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition"
description: "b2-sdk-python is a python library to access cloud storage provided by
  backblaze. Linux and Mac releases of the SDK version 1.14.0 and below contain a
  key disclosure vulnerability that, in certain conditions, can be exploited by local
  attackers through a time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition. SDK users
  of the SqliteAccountInfo format is vulnerable while users of the InMemoryAccountInfo
  format are safe. The SqliteAccountInfo saves API keys (and bucket name-to-id mapping)
  in a local database file ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME/b2/account_info, ~/.b2_account_info or
  a user-defined path). When first created, the file is world readable and is (typically
  a few milliseconds) later altered to be private to the user. If the directory containing
  the file is readable by a local attacker then during the brief period between file
  creation and permission modification, a local attacker can race to open the file
  and maintain a handle to it. This allows the local attacker to read the contents
  after the file after the sensitive information has been saved to it. Consumers of
  this SDK who rely on it to save data using SqliteAccountInfo class should upgrade
  to the latest version of the SDK. Those who believe a local user might have opened
  a handle using this race condition, should remove the affected database files and
  regenerate all application keys. Users should upgrade to b2-sdk-python 1.14.1 or
  later."
