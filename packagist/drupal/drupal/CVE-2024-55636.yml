title: "Drupal core contains a potential PHP Object Injection vulnerability"
description: "Drupal core contains a potential PHP Object Injection vulnerability
  that (if combined with another exploit) could lead to Artbitrary File Deletion.
  It is not directly exploitable.\n\nThis issue is mitigated by the fact that in order
  to be exploitable, a separate vulnerability must be present that allows an attacker
  to pass unsafe input to `unserialize()`. There are no such known exploits in Drupal
  core.\n\nTo help protect against this vulnerability, types have been added to properties
  in some of Drupal core's classes. If an application extends those classes, the same
  types may need to be specified on the subclass to avoid a `TypeError`.\n\nThis issue
  affects Drupal Core: from 8.0.0 before 10.2.11, from 10.3.0 before 10.3.9, from
  11.0.0 before 11.0.8."
