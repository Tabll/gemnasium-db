package_slug: "packagist/drupal/drupal"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "jQuery-UI is the official jQuery user interface library used by drupal. Prior 
  to version 1.13.0, accepting the value of various `*Text` options of the Datepicker widget
  from untrusted sources may execute untrusted code. The issue is fixed in jQuery
  UI 1.13.0. The values passed to various `*Text` options are now always treated as
  pure text, not HTML. A workaround is to not accept the value of the `*Text` options
  from untrusted sources."
