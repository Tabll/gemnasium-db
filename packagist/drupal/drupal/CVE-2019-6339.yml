identifier: "CVE-2019-6339"
package_slug: "packagist/drupal/drupal"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in PHP's built-in phar
  stream wrapper when performing file operations on an untrusted `phar://` URI. Some
  Drupal code (core, contrib, and custom) may be performing file operations on insufficiently
  validated user input, thereby being exposed to this vulnerability. This vulnerability
  is mitigated by the fact that such code paths typically require access to an administrative
  permission or an atypical configuration."
