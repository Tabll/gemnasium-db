identifier: "CVE-2017-6922"
package_slug: "packagist/drupal/drupal"
title: "Files uploaded by anonymous users accessed by other users"
description: "Private files that have been uploaded by an anonymous user but not permanently
  attached to content on the site should only be visible to the anonymous user that
  uploaded them, rather than all anonymous users. Drupal core does not provide this
  protection, allowing an access bypass vulnerability to occur. This issue is mitigated
  by the fact that in order to be affected, the site must allow anonymous users to
  upload files into a private file system."
