title: "Drupal Anonymous Open Redirect"
description: "Drupal core and contributed modules frequently use a \"destination\"
  query string parameter in URLs to redirect users to a new destination after completing
  an action on the current page. Under certain circumstances, malicious users can
  use this parameter to construct a URL that will trick users into being redirected
  to a 3rd party website, thereby exposing the users to potential social engineering
  attacks."
