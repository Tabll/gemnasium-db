title: "Drupal Malicious file upload with filenames stating with dot"
description: "Drupal 8 core's file_save_upload() function does not strip the leading
  and trailing dot ('.') from filenames, like Drupal 7 did.\n\nUsers with the ability
  to upload files with any extension in conjunction with contributed modules may be
  able to use this to upload system files such as .htaccess in order to bypass protections
  afforded by Drupal's default .htaccess file.\n\nAfter this fix, file_save_upload()
  now trims leading and trailing dots from filenames."
