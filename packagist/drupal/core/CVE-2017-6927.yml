identifier: "CVE-2017-6927"
package_slug: "packagist/drupal/core"
title: "JavaScript cross-site scripting prevention is incomplete"
description: "Drupal has a Drupal.checkPlain() JavaScript function which is used to
  escape potentially dangerous text before outputting it to HTML (as JavaScript output
  is not auto-escaped by either Drupal 7 or Drupal 8). This function does not correctly
  handle all methods of injecting malicious HTML, leading to a cross-site scripting
  vulnerability under certain circumstances. The PHP functions which Drupal provides
  for HTML escaping are not affected."
