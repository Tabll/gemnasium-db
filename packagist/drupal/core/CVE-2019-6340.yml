title: "Drupal Core Remote Code Execution Vulnerability"
description: "Some field types do not properly sanitize data from non-form sources
  in Drupal 8.5.x before 8.5.11 and Drupal 8.6.x before 8.6.10. This can lead to arbitrary
  PHP code execution in some cases. A site is only affected by this if one of the
  following conditions is met: The site has the Drupal 8 core RESTful Web Services
  (rest) module enabled and allows PATCH or POST requests, or the site has another
  web services module enabled, like JSON:API in Drupal 8, or Services or RESTful Web
  Services in Drupal 7. (Note: The Drupal 7 Services module itself does not require
  an update at this time, but you should apply other contributed updates associated
  with this advisory if Services is in use.)"
