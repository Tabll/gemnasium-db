title: "Drupal core uses a vulnerable Third-party library CKEditor"
description: "The Drupal project uses the third-party library [CKEditor](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4),
  which has released a [security improvement](https://ckeditor.com/blog/CKEditor-4.14-with-Paste-from-LibreOffice-released/#security-issues-fixed)
  that is needed to protect some Drupal configurations.\n\nVulnerabilities are possible
  if Drupal is configured to use the WYSIWYG CKEditor for your site's users. An attacker
  that can create or edit content may be able to exploit this Cross Site Scripting
  (XSS) vulnerability to target users with access to the WYSIWYG CKEditor, and this
  may include site admins with privileged access.\n\nThe latest versions of Drupal
  update CKEditor to 4.14 to mitigate the vulnerabilities."
