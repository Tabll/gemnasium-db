title: "Drupal core contains a potential PHP Object Injection vulnerability"
description: "Drupal core contains a potential PHP Object Injection vulnerability
  that (if combined with another exploit) could lead to Remote Code Execution. It
  is not directly exploitable.\n\nThis issue is mitigated by the fact that in order
  for it to be exploitable, a separate vulnerability must be present to allow an attacker
  to pass unsafe input to `unserialize()`. There are no such known exploits in Drupal
  core.\n\nTo help protect against this potential vulnerability, types have been added
  to properties in some of Drupal core's classes. If an application extends those
  classes, the same types may need to be specified on the subclass to avoid a `TypeError`.\n\nThis
  issue affects Drupal Core: from 8.0.0 before 10.2.11, from 10.3.0 before 10.3.9,
  from 11.0.0 before 11.0.8."
