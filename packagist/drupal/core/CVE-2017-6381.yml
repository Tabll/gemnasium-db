identifier: "CVE-2017-6381"
package_slug: "packagist/drupal/core"
title: "Remote code execution"
description: "A 3rd party development library including with Drupal 8 development
  dependencies is vulnerable to remote code execution. This is mitigated by the default
  .htaccess protection against PHP execution, and the fact that Composer development
  dependencies aren't normal installed. You might be vulnerable to this if you are
  running a version of Drupal before 8.2.2. To be sure you arenâ€™t vulnerable, you
  can remove the /vendor/phpunit directory from the site root of your production deployments."
