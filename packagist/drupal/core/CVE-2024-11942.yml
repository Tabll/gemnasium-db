title: "Drupal core vulnerable to improper error handling"
description: "Under certain uncommon site configurations, a bug in the CKEditor 5
  module can cause some image uploads to move the entire webroot to a different location
  on the file system. This could be exploited by a malicious user to take down a site.\n\nThe
  issue is mitigated by the fact that several non-default site configurations must
  exist simultaneously for this to occur."
