identifier: "CVE-2017-6923"
package_slug: "packagist/drupal/core"
title: "Missing Authorization"
description: "When creating a view, you can optionally use Ajax to update the displayed
  data via filter parameters. The views subsystem/module did not restrict access to
  the Ajax endpoint to only views configured to use Ajax. This is mitigated if you
  have access restrictions on the view. It is best practice to always include some
  form of access restrictions on all views, even if you are using another module to
  display them."
