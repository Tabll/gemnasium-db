identifier: "CVE-2016-5385"
package_slug: "packagist/drupal/core"
title: "Improper Access Control"
description: "PHP through 7.0.8 does not attempt to address RFC 3875 section 4.1.18
  namespace conflicts and therefore does not protect applications from the presence
  of untrusted client data in the `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable, which might allow
  remote attackers to redirect an application's outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary
  proxy server via a crafted Proxy header in an HTTP request, as demonstrated by (1)
  an application that makes a getenv('HTTP_PROXY') call or (2) a CGI configuration
  of PHP, aka an `httpoxy` issue."
