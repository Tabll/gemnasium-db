identifier: "CVE-2016-5385"
package_slug: "packagist/drupal/core"
title: "Improper Access Control"
description: "PHP does not attempt to address RFC section namespace conflicts and
  therefore does not protect applications from the presence of untrusted client data
  in the `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to
  redirect an application's outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy server via
  a crafted Proxy header in an HTTP request, as demonstrated by (1) an application
  that makes a getenv('HTTP_PROXY') call or (2) a CGI configuration of PHP, aka an
  `httpoxy` issue."
