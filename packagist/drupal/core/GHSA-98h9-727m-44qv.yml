title: "Drupal core Multiple vulnerabilities due to the use of the third-party library
  Archive_Tar"
description: "The Drupal project uses the third-party library [Archive_Tar](https://pear.php.net/package/Archive_Tar/),
  which has released a security improvement that is needed to protect some Drupal
  configurations.\n\nMultiple vulnerabilities are possible if Drupal is configured
  to allow .tar, .tar.gz, .bz2 or .tlz file uploads and processes them.\n\nThe latest
  versions of Drupal update Archive_Tar to 1.4.9 to mitigate the file processing vulnerabilities."
