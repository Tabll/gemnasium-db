title: "Drupal core Open Redirect vulnerability"
description: "Drupal 7 has an Open Redirect vulnerability. For example, a user could
  be tricked into visiting a specially crafted link which would redirect them to an
  arbitrary external URL.\n\nThe vulnerability is caused by insufficient validation
  of the destination query parameter in the drupal_goto() function.\n\nOther versions
  of Drupal core are not vulnerable."
