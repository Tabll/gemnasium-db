title: "Badaso CMS file upload vulnerability"
description: "An arbitrary code execution vulnerability in Badaso CMS 2.9.11. The
  Media Manager allows authenticated users to upload files containing embedded PHP
  code via the file-upload endpoint, bypassing content-type validation. When such
  a file is accessed via its URL, the server executes the PHP payload, enabling an
  attacker to run arbitrary system commands and achieve full compromise of the underlying
  host. This has been demonstrated by embedding a backdoor within a PDF and renaming
  it with a .php extension."
