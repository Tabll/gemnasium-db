title: "MagicLink: Insecure Deserialization of MagicLink Actions Leads to Remote Code
  Execution"
description: "MagicLink stores serialized action objects in the `magic_links.action`
  database column and deserializes them without integrity validation or class allowlisting
  in [src/MagicLink.php](src/MagicLink.php#L59-L77) and [src/Actions/ResponseAction.php](src/Actions/ResponseAction.php#L64-L77).
  An attacker with the ability to manipulate database records (e.g., via SQL injection
  or compromised admin access) could inject malicious serialized objects containing
  arbitrary closures, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) when the magic link is
  visited."
