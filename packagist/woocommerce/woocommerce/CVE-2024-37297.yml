description: "A vulnerability introduced in WooCommerce 8.8 allows for cross-site
  scripting. A bad actor can manipulate a link to include malicious HTML & JavaScript
  content. While the content is not saved to the database, the links may be sent to
  victims for malicious purposes. The injected JavaScript could hijack content & data
  stored in the browser, including the session.\nThe URL content is read through the
  Sourcebuster.js library and then inserted without proper sanitization to the classic
  checkout and registration forms."
