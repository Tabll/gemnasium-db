title: "Neuron MySQLWriteTool allows arbitrary/destructive SQL when exposed to untrusted
  prompts (agent “footgun”)"
description: "`MySQLWriteTool` executes arbitrary SQL provided by the caller using
  `PDO::prepare()` + `execute()` without semantic restrictions.\n\nThis is consistent
  with the name (“write tool”), but in an LLM/agent context it becomes a high-risk
  capability: prompt injection or indirect prompt manipulation can cause execution
  of destructive queries such as `DROP TABLE`, `TRUNCATE`, `DELETE`, `ALTER`, or privilege-related
  statements (subject to DB permissions).\n\n\n\n**Who is impacted:** Deployments
  that expose an agent with `MySQLWriteTool` enabled to untrusted input and/or run
  the tool with a DB user that has broad privileges."
