title: "Neuron MySQLSelectTool “read-only” bypass via `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE` (file
  write → potential RCE)"
description: "`MySQLSelectTool` is intended to be a read-only SQL tool (e.g., for
  LLM agent querying). However, validation based on the first keyword (e.g., `SELECT`)
  and a forbidden-keyword list does not block file-writing constructs such as `INTO
  OUTFILE` / `INTO DUMPFILE`.\n\nAs a result, an attacker who can influence the tool
  input (e.g., prompt injection through a public agent endpoint) may be able to write
  arbitrary content to files on the DB server.\n\nIf the MySQL/MariaDB account has
  the `FILE` privilege and server configuration permits writes to a useful location
  (e.g., a web-accessible directory), the impact can escalate to remote code execution
  on the application host (for example, by writing a PHP web shell).\n\n**Who is impacted:**
  Deployments that expose an agent using `MySQLSelectTool` to untrusted input and
  run with overly-permissive DB privileges/configuration."
