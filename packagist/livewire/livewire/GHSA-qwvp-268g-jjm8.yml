title: "Data Leakage Vulnerability in livewire/livewire"
description: "livewire/livewire versions greater than 2.2.4 and less than 2.2.6 are
  affected by a data leakage vulnerability. The `$this->validate()` method, which
  is expected to return only the validated dataset, was returning all properties of
  the Livewire component. This regression introduced a security risk, allowing unvalidated
  data to be exposed, which could lead to unexpected behavior and potential security
  issues."
