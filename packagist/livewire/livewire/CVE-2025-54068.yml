title: "Livewire is vulnerable to remote command execution during component property
  update hydration"
description: "In Livewire v3 (≤ 3.6.3), a vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers
  to achieve remote command execution in specific scenarios. The issue stems from
  how certain component property updates are hydrated. This vulnerability is unique
  to Livewire v3 and does not affect prior major versions. Exploitation requires a
  component to be mounted and configured in a particular way, but does not require
  authentication or user interaction."
