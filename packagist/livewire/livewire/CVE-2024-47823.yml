package_slug: "packagist/livewire/livewire"
title: "Livewire Remote Code Execution on File Uploads"
description: "In livewire/livewire prior to `v2.12.7` and `v3.5.2`, the file extension
  of an uploaded file is guessed based on the MIME type. As a result, the actual file
  extension from the file name is not validated. An attacker can therefore bypass
  the validation by uploading a file with a valid MIME type (e.g., `image/png`) and
  a “.php” file extension.\nIf the following criteria are met, the attacker can carry
  out an RCE attack:\n\n- Filename is composed of the original file name using `$file->getClientOriginalName()`\n-
  Files stored directly on your server in a public storage disk\n- Webserver is configured
  to execute “.php” files"
