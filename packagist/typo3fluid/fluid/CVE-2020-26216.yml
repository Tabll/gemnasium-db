identifier: "CVE-2020-26216"
package_slug: "packagist/typo3fluid/fluid"
title: "Cross-site Scripting"
description: "TYPO3 Fluid is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting. Three XSS vulnerabilities
  have been detected in Fluid - `TagBasedViewHelper` allowed XSS through maliciously
  crafted additionalAttributes arrays by creating keys with attribute-closing quotes
  followed by HTML. When rendering such attributes, `TagBuilder` would not escape the
  keys. `ViewHelpers` which used the `CompileWithContentArgumentAndRenderStatic` trait,
  and which declared escapeOutput = false, would receive the content argument in unescaped
  format. Subclasses of `AbstractConditionViewHelper` would receive the then and else
  arguments in unescaped format. More details are available in the linked advisory."
