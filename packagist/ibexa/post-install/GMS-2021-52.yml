description: "The default configuration for platform.sh (.platform.app.yaml) allows
  access to uploaded files if you know or can guess their location, regardless of
  whether roles grant content read access to the content containing those files. If

  legacy files that should not be readable, including the legacy var directory and
  extension directories."
