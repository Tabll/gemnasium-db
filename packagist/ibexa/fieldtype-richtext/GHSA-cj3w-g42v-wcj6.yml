title: "ibexa/fieldtype-richtext allows access to external entities in XML"
description: "This security advisory resolves a vulnerability in the RichText field
  type. By entering a maliciously crafted input into the RichText XML, an attacker
  could perform an attack using XML external entity (XXE) injection, which might be
  able to read files on the server. To exploit this vulnerability the attacker would
  need to already have edit permission to content with RichText fields, which typically
  means Editor role or higher. The fix removes unsafe elements from XML code, while
  preserving safe elements.\n\nIf you have a stored XXE attack in your content drafts,
  the fix prevents it from extracting data both during editing and preview. However,
  if such an attack has already been published and the result is stored in the content,
  it is unfortunately not possible to detect and remove it by automatic means."
