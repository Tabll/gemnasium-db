title: "ibexa/fieldtype-richtext has an XSS vulnerability via acronym custom tag in
  Rich Text"
description: "This security advisory resolves an XSS vulnerability in acronym custom
  tag in Rich Text, in the back office of the DXP. Back office access and varying
  levels of editing and management permissions are required to exploit this vulnerability.
  This typically means Editor or Administrator role, or similar. Injected XSS is persistent
  and may in some cases be reflected in the front office, possibly affecting end users.
  The fixes ensure XSS is escaped, and any existing injected XSS is rendered harmless."
