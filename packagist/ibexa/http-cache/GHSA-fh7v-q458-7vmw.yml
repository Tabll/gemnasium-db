  VCL templates enable compression of API and JSON messages. This is a potential case
  of the BREACH vulnerability, which affects HTTP compression, where secrets can be
  extracted through carefully crafted requests. The fix disables compression in these
  templates. Please make sure to make the same change in your configuration files,
