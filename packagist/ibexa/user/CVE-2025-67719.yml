- "GHSA-x93p-w2ch-fg67"
package_slug: "packagist/ibexa/user"
title: "Ibexa User Bundle is missing password change validation"
description: "The vulnerability is in the password change dialog in the back office.
  During the transition from v4 to v5 a mistake was made in the validation code which
  caused the validation of the previous password to not run as expected. This made
  it possible for a logged in user to change password in the back office without knowing
  the previous password. For example if someone logs in, leaves their workstation
  unlocked, and another person uses the same machine."
