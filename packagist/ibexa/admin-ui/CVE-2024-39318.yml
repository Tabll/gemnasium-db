package_slug: "packagist/ibexa/admin-ui"
title: "Ibexa Admin UI vulnerable to DOM-based Cross-site Scripting in file upload
  widget"
description: "The file upload widget is vulnerable to XSS payloads in filenames. Access
  permission to upload files is required. As such, in most cases only authenticated
  editors and administrators will have the required permission. It is not persistent,
  i.e. the payload is only executed during the upload. In effect, an attacker will
  have to trick an editor/administrator into uploading a strangely named file. The
  fix ensures XSS is escaped."
