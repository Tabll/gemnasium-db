title: "Ibexa DXP users with the Company admin role can assign any role to any user"
description: "Critical severity. Users with the Company admin role (introduced by
  the company account feature in v4) can assign any role to any user. This also applies
  to any other user that has the role / assign policy. Any subtree limitation in place
  does not have any effect.\n\nThe role / assign policy is typically only given to
  administrators, which limits the scope in most cases, but please verify who has
  this policy in your installaton. The fix ensures that subtree limitations are working
  as intended."
