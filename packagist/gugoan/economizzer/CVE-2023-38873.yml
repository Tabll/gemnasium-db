title: "Economizzer vulnerable to Clickjacking"
description: "The commit 3730880 (April 2023) and v.0.9-beta1 of gugoan Economizzer
  is vulnerable to Clickjacking. Clickjacking, also known as a \"UI redress attack\",
  is when an attacker uses multiple transparent or opaque layers to trick a user into
  clicking on a button or link on another page when they were intending to click on
  the top-level page. Thus, the attacker is \"hijacking\" clicks meant for their page
  and routing them to another page, most likely owned by another application, domain,
  or both."
