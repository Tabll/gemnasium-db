title: "[TagAwareCipher] - Decryption Failure (Regex Match)"
description: "Vulnerability in **SecureProps** involves a regex failing to detect
  tags during decryption of encrypted data.\n\nThis occurs when the encrypted data
  has been encoded with `NullEncoder` and passed to `TagAwareCipher`, and contains
  special characters such as `\\n`. As a result, the decryption process is skipped
  since the tags are not detected. This causes the encrypted data to be returned in
  plain format.\n\nThe vulnerability affects users who implement `TagAwareCipher`
  with any base cipher that has `NullEncoder` (not default)."
