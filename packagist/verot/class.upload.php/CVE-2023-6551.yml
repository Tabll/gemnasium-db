description: "As a simple library, class.upload.php does not perform an in-depth check
  on uploaded files, allowing a stored XSS vulnerability when the default configuration
  is used. \n\n\nDevelopers must be aware of that fact and use extension allow listing
  accompanied by forcing the server to always provide content-type based on the file
  extension. \n\n\nThe README has been updated to include these guidelines.\n\n\n"
