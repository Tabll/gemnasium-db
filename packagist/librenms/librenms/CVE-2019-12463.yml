package_slug: "packagist/librenms/librenms"
title: "Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output"
description: "An issue was discovered in LibreNMS 1.50.1. The scripts that handle
  graphing options (includes/html/graphs/common.inc.php and includes/html/graphs/graphs.inc.php)
  do not sufficiently validate or encode several fields of user supplied input. Some
  parameters are filtered with mysqli_real_escape_string, which is only useful for
  preventing SQL injection attacks; other parameters are unfiltered. This allows an
  attacker to inject RRDtool syntax with newline characters via the html/graph.php
  and html/graph-realtime.php scripts. RRDtool syntax is quite versatile and an attacker
  could leverage this to perform a number of attacks, including disclosing directory
  structure and filenames, disclosing file content, denial of service, or writing
  arbitrary files. NOTE: relative to CVE-2019-10665, this requires authentication
  and the pathnames differ."
