package_slug: "packagist/librenms/librenms"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream
  Component ('Injection')"
description: "An issue was discovered in LibreNMS through 1.47. The scripts that handle
  the graphing options (html/includes/graphs/common.inc.php and html/includes/graphs/graphs.inc.php)
  do not sufficiently validate or encode several fields of user supplied input. Some
  parameters are filtered with mysqli_real_escape_string, which is only useful for
  preventing SQL injection attacks; other parameters are unfiltered. This allows an
  attacker to inject RRDtool syntax with newline characters via the html/graph.php
  script. RRDtool syntax is quite versatile and an attacker could leverage this to
  perform a number of attacks, including disclosing directory structure and filenames,
  file content, denial of service, or writing arbitrary files."
