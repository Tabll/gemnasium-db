title: "LibreNMS: SQL Injection in ajax_table.php spreads through a covert data stream."
description: "*SQL Injection in IPv6 Address Search functionality via `address` parameter**\n\nA
  SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `ajax_table.php` endpoint. The application
  fails to properly sanitize or parameterize user input when processing IPv6 address
  searches. Specifically, the `address` parameter is split into an address and a prefix,
  and the prefix portion is directly concatenated into the SQL query string without
  validation. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands, potentially
  leading to unauthorized data access or database manipulation."
