package_slug: "packagist/librenms/librenms"
title: "LibreNMS has Broken Access control on Graphs Feature"
description: "LibreNMS is an auto-discovering PHP/MySQL/SNMP based network monitoring
  which includes support for a wide range of network hardware and operating systems.
  In affected versions of LibreNMS when a user accesses their device dashboard, one
  request is sent to `graph.php` to access graphs generated on the particular Device.
  This request can be accessed by a low privilege user and they can enumerate devices
  on librenms with their id or hostname. Leveraging this vulnerability a low privilege
  user can see all devices registered by admin users. This vulnerability has been
  addressed in commit `489978a923` which has been included in release version 23.11.0.
  Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
