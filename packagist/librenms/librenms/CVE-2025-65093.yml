title: "LibreNMS is vulnerable to SQL Injection (Boolean-Based Blind) in hostname
  parameter in ajax_output.php endpoint"
description: "A **Boolean-Based Blind SQL Injection** vulnerability was identified
  in the LibreNMS application at the `/ajax_output.php` endpoint. The `hostname` parameter

  binding, allowing an attacker to manipulate the query logic and infer data from
  the database through conditional responses.\n\n---"
