title: "LibreNMS has a Stored XSS vulnerability in its Alert Transport name field"
description: "LibreNMS <= 25.8.0 contains a **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
  vulnerability in the Alert Transports management functionality. When an administrator
  creates a new Alert Transport, the value of the `Transport name` field is stored
  and later rendered in the **Transports** column of the **Alert Rules** page without
  proper input validation or output encoding. This leads to arbitrary JavaScript execution
  in the adminâ€™s browser."
