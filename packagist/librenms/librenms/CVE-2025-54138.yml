title: "LibreNMS has Authenticated Remote File Inclusion in ajax_form.php that Allows
  RCE"
description: "LibreNMS 25.6.0 contains an architectural vulnerability in the `ajax_form.php`
  endpoint that permits Remote File Inclusion based on user-controlled POST input.\n\nThe
  application directly uses the `type` parameter to dynamically include `.inc.php`
  files from the trusted path `includes/html/forms/`, without validation or allowlisting:\n\n```php\nif
  (file_exists('includes/html/forms/' . $_POST['type'] . '.inc.php')) {\ninclude_once
  'includes/html/forms/' . $_POST['type'] . '.inc.php';\n}\n```\nThis pattern introduces
  a latent Remote Code Execution (RCE) vector if an attacker can stage a file in this
  include path â€” for example, via symlink, development misconfiguration, or chained
  vulnerabilities.\n\n>  This is not an arbitrary file upload bug. But it does provide
  a powerful execution sink for attackers with write access (direct or indirect) to
  the include directory."
