title: "LibreNMS has an Authenticated OS Command Injection"
description: "An authenticated attacker can create dangerous directory names on the
  system and alter sensitive configuration parameters through the web portal. Those
  two defects combined then allows to inject arbitrary OS commands inside `shell_exec()`
  calls, thus achieving arbitrary code execution.\n\nWith all this, an authenticated
  attacker can:\n- Create a malicious Device with shell metacharacters inside its
  hostname\n- Force the creation of directory containing shell metacharacters through
  the PollDevice job\n- Modify the `snmpget` configuration variable to point to a
  valid system binary, while also using the directory created in the previous step
  via a path traversal (i.e: `/path/to/install/dir/rrd/<DEVICE_HOSTNAME>/../../../../../../../bin/ls`)\n-
  Trigger a code execution via the `shell_exec()` call contained in the `AboutController.php`
  script"
