title: "Freeform Craft Plugin CP UI (builder/integrations) has Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  (XSS) issue"
description: "**Summary**\nAn authenticated, low-privilege user (able to create/edit
  forms) can inject arbitrary HTML/JS into the Craft Control Panel (CP) builder and
  integrations views. User-controlled form labels and integration metadata are rendered
  with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without sanitization, leading to stored XSS that
  executes when any admin views the builder/integration screens.\n\n**Affected Product**\n-
  Ecosystem: Packagist (Craft CMS plugin)\n- Package: solspace/craft-freeform\n- Version:
  <= 5.14.6 (latest observed). Likely all 5.x until patched."
