title: "Sharp user-provided input can be evaluated in a SharpShowTextField with Vue
  template syntax"
description: "A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in code16/sharp
  when rendering content using the SharpShowTextField component.\n\nIn affected versions,
  expressions wrapped in `{{` & `}}` were evaluated by Vue. This allowed attackers
  to inject arbitrary JavaScript or HTML that executes in the browser when the field
  is displayed.\n\nFor example, if a field’s value contains `{{ Math.random() }}`,
  it will be executed instead of being displayed as text."
