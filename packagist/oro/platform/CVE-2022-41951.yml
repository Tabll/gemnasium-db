title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "OroPlatform is a PHP Business Application Platform (BAP) designed to
  make development of custom business applications easier and faster. Path Traversal
  is possible in `Oro\\Bundle\\GaufretteBundle\\FileManager::getTemporaryFileName`.
