identifier: "CVE-2020-11094"
package_slug: "packagist/rainlab/debugbar-plugin"
title: "Inclusion of Sensitive Information in Log Files"
description: "The October CMS debugbar plugin contains a feature where it will log
  all requests (and all information pertaining to each request including session data)
  whenever it is enabled. This presents a problem if the plugin is ever enabled on
  a system that is open to untrusted users as the potential exists for them to use
  this feature to view all requests being made to the application and obtain sensitive
  information from those requests. There even exists the potential for account takeovers
  of authenticated users by non-authenticated public users, which would then lead
  to a number of other potential issues as an attacker could theoretically get full
  access to the system if the required conditions existed."
