title: "Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')"
description: "Smarty is a template engine for PHP, facilitating the separation of
  presentation (HTML/CSS) from application logic. Prior to versions 3.1.45 and 4.1.1,
  template authors could inject php code by choosing a malicious {block} name or {include}
  file name. Sites that cannot fully trust template authors should upgrade to versions
  3.1.45 or 4.1.1 to receive a patch for this issue. There are currently no known
  workarounds."
