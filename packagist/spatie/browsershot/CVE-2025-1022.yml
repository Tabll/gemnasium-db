package_slug: "packagist/spatie/browsershot"
title: "Browsershot Path Traversal"
description: "Versions of the package spatie/browsershot before 5.0.5 are vulnerable
  to Improper Input Validation in the setHtml function, invoked by Browsershot::html(),
  which can be bypassed by omitting the slashes in the file URI (e.g., file:../../../../etc/passwd).
  This is due to missing validations of the user input that should be blocking file
  URI schemes (e.g., file:// and file:/) in the HTML content."
