title: "PHPECC vulnerable to multiple cryptographic side-channel attacks"
description: "### ECDSA Canonicalization\n\nPHPECC is vulnerable to malleable ECDSA
  signature attacks. \n\n### Constant-Time Signer\n\nWhen generating a new ECDSA signature,
  the GMPMath adapter was used. This class wraps the GNU Multiple Precision arithmetic
  library (GMP), which does not aim to provide constant-time implementations of algorithms.\n\nAn
  attacker capable of triggering many signatures and studying the time it takes to
  perform each operation would be able to leak the secret number, `k`, and thereby
  learn the private key.\n\n### EcDH Timing Leaks\n\nWhen calculating a shared secret
  using the `EcDH` class, the scalar-point multiplication is based on the arithmetic
  defined by the `Point` class.\n\nEven though the library implements a Montgomery
  ladder, the `add()`, `mul()`, and `getDouble()` methods on the `Point` class are
  not constant-time. This means that your ECDH private keys are leaking information
  about each bit of your private key through a timing side-channel."
