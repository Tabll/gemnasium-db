title: "Snipe-IT has Cross-site Scripting vulnerability in CSV import workflow"
description: "Snipe-IT v8.3.4 (build 20218) contains a reflected cross-site scripting
  (XSS) vulnerability in the CSV Import workflow. When an invalid CSV file is uploaded,
  the application returns a progress_message value that is rendered as raw HTML in
  the admin interface. An attacker can intercept and modify the POST /livewire/update
  request to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript into the progress_message. Because
  the server accepts the modified input without sanitization and reflects it back
  to the user, arbitrary JavaScript executes in the browser of any authenticated admin
  who views the import page."
