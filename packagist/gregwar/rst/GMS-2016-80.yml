title: "Local File Inclusion Vulnerability"
description: "Gregwar is vulnerable to local file inclusion when including RST templates."
date: "2016-10-31"
pubdate: "2016-10-31"
affected_range: "<1.0.3"
fixed_versions:
- "v1.0.3"
affected_versions: "All versions before 1.0.3"
solution: "Upgrade to version 1.0.3 and set the \"include\" parameter according to
  your needs. If you're loading RST templates from a database, disable include. If
  you're loading RST templates from the filesystem and need include for snippets,
  jail all includes to within a common directory."
