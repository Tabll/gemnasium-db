description: "## usd-2024-0009 | Reflected XSS in Oveleon Cookiebar\n\n### Details\n**Advisory
  ID**: usd-2024-0009 \n**Product**: Cookiebar   \n**Affected Version**: 2.X  \n**Vulnerability
  Type**: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site
  Scripting')   \n**Security Risk**: HIGH, CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N
  \  \n**Vendor URL**: https://www.usd.de/    \n**Vendor acknowledged vulnerability**:
  Yes    \n**Vendor Status**: Fixed   \n**CVE Number**: Not requested yet    \n**CVE
  Link**: Not requested yet    \n**First Published**: Published  \n**Last Update**:
  2024-07-29\n\n\n### Affected Component\n\nThe `block` function in `CookiebarController.php`.\n\n\n###
  Desciption\n\nOveleon's Cookiebar is an extension for the popular Contao CMS.\nThe
  `block/locale` endpoint does not properly sanitize the user-controlled `locale`
  input before including it in the backend's HTTP response, thereby causing reflected
  XSS.\n\n### Proof of Concept\nThe vulnerability could be triggered by entering the
  following Link:\n\n```\nhttps://[redacted].de/cookiebar/block/dens82w%22%3E%3Cimg%20src%3da%20onerror%3dalert(1)%3Ew9qt\nn/[id]?redirect=https%3A%2F%2F[...]amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D3%26amp%3Bmo\ndestbranding%3D1%26amp%3Brel%3D0\n```\n\nIt
  is likely related to the following function in the Oveleon Cookiebar source code:\n\n```php\n
  \   /**\n     * Block content\n     *\n     * @Route(\"/cookiebar/block/{locale}/{id}\",
  name=\"cookiebar_block\")\n     */\n    public function block(Request $request,
  string $locale, int $id): Response\n    {\n        System::loadLanguageFile('tl_cookiebar',
  $locale);\n\n        $this->framework->initialize();\n\n        $objCookie = CookieModel::findById($id);\n\n
  \       if (null === $objCookie || null === $request->headers->get('referer'))\n
  \       {\n            throw new PageNotFoundException();\n        }\n\n        $strUrl
  = $request->get('redirect');\n\n        // Protect against XSS attacks\n        if(!Validator::isUrl($strUrl))\n
  \       {\n            return new Response('The redirect destination must be a valid
  URL.', Response::HTTP_BAD_REQUEST);\n        }\n\n        $objTemplate = new FrontendTemplate($objCookie->blockTemplate
  ?: 'ccb_element_blocker');\n\n        $objTemplate->language = $locale;\n        $objTemplate->id
  = $objCookie->id;\n        $objTemplate->title = $objCookie->title;\n        $objTemplate->type
  = $objCookie->type;\n        $objTemplate->iframeType = $objCookie->iframeType;\n
  \       $objTemplate->description = $objCookie->blockDescription;\n        $objTemplate->redirect
  = $request->get('redirect');\n        $objTemplate->acceptAndDisplayLabel = $this->translator->trans('tl_cookiebar.acceptAndDisplayLabel',
  [], 'contao_default', $locale);\n\n        return $objTemplate->getResponse();\n
  \   }\n```\n\n### Fix\nSanitize the `locale` input to prevent XSS payloads from
  being executed in a user's browser.\n\n\n### References\n- https://github.com/oveleon/contao-cookiebar/blob/2.x/src/Controller/CookiebarController.php\n-
