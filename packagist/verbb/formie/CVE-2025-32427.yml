package_slug: "packagist/verbb/formie"
title: "Formie has XSS vulnerability for importing forms"
description: "When importing a form from JSON, if the field label or handle contained
  malicious content, the output wasn't correctly escaped when viewing a preview of
  what was to be imported.\n\nAs imports are undertaking primarily by users who have
  themselves exported the form from one environment to another, and would require
  direct manipulation of the JSON export, this is marked as moderate. This vulnerability
  will not occur unless someone deliberately tampers with the export."
