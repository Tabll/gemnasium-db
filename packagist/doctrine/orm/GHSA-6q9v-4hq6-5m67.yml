title: "Doctrine SQL injection vulnerability"
description: "Doctrine is prone to SQL injection vulnerability. Users of Doctrine
  1.2 and 2 should update to the newly released versions of both libraries immediately.
  Both versions only include the security fix and no other changes to their previous
  versions 1.2.3 and 2.0.2.\n\nAffected versions are:\n- 1.2.3 and earlier for PostgreSQL
  and DB2 Dialects\n- 2.0.2 and earlier\n\nThe security issue was found to affect
  the `Doctrine\\DBAL\\Platforms\\AbstractPlatform::modifyLimitQuery()` function which
  does not cast input values for limit and offset to integer and allows malicious
  SQL to be executed if these parameters are passed into Doctrine 2 directly from
  request variables without previous cast to integer. Functionality building on top
  using limit queries in the ORM such as `Doctrine\\ORM\\Query::setFirstResult()`
  and `Doctrine\\ORM\\Query::setMaxResults()` are also affected by this security issue.\n\nThe
  fix for this security issue breaks backwards compatibility for developers that extend
  the `Doctrine\\DBAL\\Platforms\\AbstractPlatform::modifyLimitQuery()` method, because
  it is now marked as final. Please overwrite the `Doctrine\\DBAL\\Platforms\\AbstractPlatform::doModifyLimitQuery()`
  method instead."
