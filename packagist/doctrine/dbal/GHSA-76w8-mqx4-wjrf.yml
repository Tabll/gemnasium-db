description: "The identifier quoting in Doctrine DBAL has a potential security problem
  when user-input is passed into this function, making the security aspect of this
  functionality obsolete.\nIf you make use of AbstractPlatform::quoteIdentifier()
  or Doctrine::quoteIdentifier() please upgrade immediately. The ORM itself does not
  use identifier quoting in combination with user-input, however we still urge everyone
  to update to the latest version of DBAL."
