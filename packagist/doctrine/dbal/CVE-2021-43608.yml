package_slug: "packagist/doctrine/dbal"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')"
description: "Doctrine DBAL 3.x before 3.1.4 allows SQL Injection. The escaping of
  offset and length inputs to the generation of a LIMIT clause was not probably cast
  to an integer, allowing SQL injection to take place if application developers passed
  unescaped user input to the DBAL QueryBuilder or any other API that ultimately uses
  the AbstractPlatform::modifyLimitQuery API."
