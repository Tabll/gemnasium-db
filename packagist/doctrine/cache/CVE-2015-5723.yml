package_slug: "packagist/doctrine/cache"
title: "Security Misconfiguration Vulnerability"
description: "Doctrine uses `mkdir($cacheDirectory, 0777)` to create caches directories.
  If your application is running with umask(0), this allows an attacker to write arbitrary
  code into the cache directory which can be executed with the user privileges of
  the webserver. You are only affected by this vulnerability, if your application
  runs with a umask of 0. "
