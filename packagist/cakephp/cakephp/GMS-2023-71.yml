title: "CakePHP vulnerable to Denial of Service attack through XML payloads"
description: "RequestHandlerComponent had a vulnerability that would allow well crafted
  requests to create a denial of service attack. RequestHandlerComponent leverages
  `Xml::build()` which allows reading local files. We recommend that all applications
  using RequestHandlerComponent upgrade, or disable parsing XML payloads."
