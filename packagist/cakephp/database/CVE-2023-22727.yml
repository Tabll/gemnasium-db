package_slug: "packagist/cakephp/database"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')"
description: "CakePHP is a development framework for PHP web apps. In affected versions
  the `Cake\\Database\\Query::limit()` and `Cake\\Database\\Query::offset()` methods
  is vulnerable to SQL injection if passed un-sanitized user request data. This issue
  has been fixed in 4.2.12, 4.3.11, 4.4.10. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable
  to upgrade may mitigate this issue by using CakePHP's Pagination library. Manually
  validating or casting parameters to these methods will also mitigate the issue."
