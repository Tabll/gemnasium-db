title: "Craft CMS Vulnerable to SQL Injection in Element Indexes via `criteria[orderBy]`"
description: "The `element-indexes/get-elements` endpoint is vulnerable to **SQL Injection**
  via the `criteria[orderBy]` parameter (JSON body). The application fails to sanitize
  this input before using it in the database query.\nAn attacker with **Control Panel
  access** can inject arbitrary SQL into the `ORDER BY` clause by omitting `viewState[order]`
  (or setting both to the same payload).\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The `ORDER BY` clause executes
  per row. `SLEEP(1)` on 10 rows = 10s delay.\n\n---"
