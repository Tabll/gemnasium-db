title: "Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data"
description: "All Craft CMS versions between 3.0.0 and 3.7.32 disclose password hashes
  of users who authenticate using their E-Mail address or username in Anti-CSRF-Tokens.
  Craft CMS uses a cookie called CRAFT_CSRF_TOKEN and a HTML hidden field called CRAFT_CSRF_TOKEN
  to avoid Cross Site Request Forgery attacks. The CRAFT_CSRF_TOKEN cookie discloses
  the password hash in without encoding it whereas the corresponding HTML hidden field
  discloses the users' password hash in a masked manner, which can be decoded by using
  public functions of the YII framework."
