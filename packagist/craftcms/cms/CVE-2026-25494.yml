title: "Craft CMS Vulnerable to SSRF in GraphQL Asset Mutation via Alternative IP
  Notation"
description: "The `saveAsset` GraphQL mutation uses `filter_var(..., FILTER_VALIDATE_IP)`
  to block a specific list of IP addresses. However, alternative IP notations (hexadecimal,
  mixed) are not recognized by this function, allowing attackers to bypass the blocklist
  and access cloud metadata services.\n\n---"
