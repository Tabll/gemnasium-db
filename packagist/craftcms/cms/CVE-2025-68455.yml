title: "Craft CMS vulnerable to potential authenticated Remote Code Execution via
  malicious attached Behavior"
description: "This was reported as a vulnerability in Yii framework on August 7th
  (https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/security/advisories/GHSA-gcmh-9pjj-7fp4). The Yii
  framework team denies responsibility for this (placing the onus on application developers)
  and hence has not (and seemingly will not) provide a fix at the framework level.
  Hence, I am reporting this to Craft as I found it to affect the latest (`5.6.0`)
  version of Craft CMS.\n\nLeveraging a legitimate but maliciously crafted Yii `Behavior`
  class, it’s possible to trigger Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Reflection when
  the tainted `Behavior` is attached to a Yii `Component`, and an event is also fired
  on the tainted `Component`."
