- "CVE-2022-29933"
package_slug: "packagist/craftcms/cms"
title: "Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password"
description: "Craft CMS through 3.7.36 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker, who
  knows at least one valid username, to reset the account's password and take over
  the account by providing a crafted HTTP header to the application while using the
  password reset functionality. Specifically, the attacker must send X-Forwarded-Host
  to the /index.php?p=admin/actions/users/send-password-reset-email URI. NOTE: the
  vendor's position is that a customer can already work around this by adjusting the
  configuration (i.e., by not using the default configuration)."
