title: "Craft CMS vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via GraphQL Asset
  Upload Mutation"
description: "The Craft CMS GraphQL `save_<VolumeName>_Asset` mutation is vulnerable
  to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). This vulnerability arises because the `_file`
  input, specifically its `url` parameter, allows the server to fetch content from
  arbitrary remote locations without proper validation. Attackers can exploit this
  by providing internal IP addresses or cloud metadata endpoints as the `url`, forcing
  the server to make requests to these restricted services. The fetched content is
  then saved as an asset, which can subsequently be accessed and exfiltrated, leading
  to potential data exposure and infrastructure compromise. This exploitation requires
  specific GraphQL permissions for asset management within the targeted volume.\n\nUsers
  should update to the patched 5.8.21 and 4.16.17 releases to mitigate the issue.References:\n\nhttps://github.com/craftcms/cms/commit/013db636fdb38f3ce5657fd196b6d952f98ebc52\n\nhttps://github.com/craftcms/cms/blob/5.x/CHANGELOG.md"
