title: "Craft CMS stores arbitrary content provided by unauthenticated users in session
  files"
description: "Craft CMS stores arbitrary content provided by unauthenticated users
  in session files. This content could be accessed and executed, possibly using an
  independent vulnerability. Craft CMS redirects requests that require authentication
  to the login page and generates a session file on the server at `/var/lib/php/sessions`.
  Such session files are named `sess_[session_value]`, where `[session_value]` is
  provided to the client in a `Set-Cookie` response header. Craft CMS stores the return
  URL requested by the client without sanitizing parameters. Consequently, an unauthenticated
  client can introduce arbitrary values, such as PHP code, to a known local file location
  on the server. Craft CMS versions 5.7.5 and 4.15.3 have been released to address
  this issue."
