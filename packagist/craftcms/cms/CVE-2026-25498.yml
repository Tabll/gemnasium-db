title: "Craft CMS Vulnerable to potential authenticated Remote Code Execution via
  malicious attached Behavior"
description: "A Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in Craft CMS where
  the `assembleLayoutFromPost()` function in `src/services/Fields.php` fails to sanitize
  user-supplied configuration data before passing it to `Craft::createObject()`. This
  allows authenticated administrators to inject malicious Yii2 behavior configurations
  that execute arbitrary system commands on the server. This vulnerability represents
  an **unpatched variant** of the behavior injection vulnerability addressed in GHSA-255j-qw47-wjh5,
  affecting different endpoints through a separate code path.\n\n---"
