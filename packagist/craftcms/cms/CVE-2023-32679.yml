title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream
  Component ('Injection')"
description: "Craft CMS is an open source content management system. In affected versions
  of Craft CMS an unrestricted file extension may lead to Remote Code Execution. If
  the name parameter value is not empty string('') in the View.php's doesTemplateExist()
  -> resolveTemplate() -> _resolveTemplateInternal() -> _resolveTemplate() function,
  it returns directly without extension verification, so that arbitrary extension
  files are rendered as twig templates. When attacker with admin privileges on a DEV
  or an improperly configured STG or PROD environment, they can exploit this vulnerability
  to remote code execution. Code execution may grant the attacker access to the host
  operating system. This issue has been addressed in version 4.4.6. Users are advised
  to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
