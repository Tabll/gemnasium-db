title: "Craft CMS Vulnerable to SSRF in GraphQL Asset Mutation via HTTP Redirect"
description: "The `saveAsset` GraphQL mutation validates the initial URL hostname
  and resolved IP against a blocklist, but Guzzle follows HTTP redirects by default.
  An attacker can bypass all SSRF protections by hosting a redirect that points to
  cloud metadata endpoints or any internal IP addresses.\n\n---"
