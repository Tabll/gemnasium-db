title: "Craft CMS: save_images_Asset graphql mutation can be abused to exfiltrate
  AWS credentials of underlying host"
description: "- The save_images_Asset graphql mutation allows a user to give a url
  of an image to download.  (Url must use a domain, not a raw IP.)\n- Attacker sets
  up domain attacker.domain with an A record of something like 169.254.169.254 (special
  AWS metadata IP)\n- Attacker invokes save_images_Asset with url: http://attacker.domain/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials
  and filename \"foo.txt\"\n- Craft fetches sensitive information on attacker's behalf,
  and makes it available for download at /assets/images/foo.txt\n- Normal checks to
  verify that image is valid are bypassed because of .txt extension\n- Normal checks
  to verify that url is not an IP address are bypassed because user provided a valid
  domain that resolves to a sensitive internal IP address"
