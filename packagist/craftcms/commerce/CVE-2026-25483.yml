title: "Craft Commerce has Stored XSS via Order Status Message with potential database
  exfiltration"
description: "A stored XSS vulnerability exists in Craft Commerce’s Order Status History
  Message. The message is rendered using the `|md` filter, which permits raw HTML,
  enabling malicious script execution. If a user has database backup utility permissions
  (which do not require an elevated session), an attacker can exfiltrate the entire
  database, including all user credentials, customer PII, order history, and 2FA recovery
  codes.\n\nUsers are recommended to update to the patched 5.5.2 release to mitigate
  the issue.\n\n---"
