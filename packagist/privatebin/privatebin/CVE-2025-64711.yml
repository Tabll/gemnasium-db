identifiers:
- "CVE-2025-64711"
- "GHSA-r9x7-7ggj-fx9f"
package_slug: "packagist/privatebin/privatebin"
title: "PrivateBin vulnerable to malicious filename use for self-XSS / HTML injection
  locally for users"
description: "Dragging a file whose filename contains HTML is reflected verbatim into
  the page via the drag-and-drop helper, so any user who drops a crafted file on PrivateBin
  will execute arbitrary JavaScript within their own session (self-XSS). This allows
  an attacker who can entice a victim to drag or otherwise attach such a file to exfiltrate
  plaintext, encryption keys, or stored pastes before they are encrypted or sent.\n\n**Note
  1:** as the malicious filename must contain the `>` character, the victim must not
  be using Windows for this to work, since this OS simply forbids this character in
  filenames.\n\n**Note 2:** most PrivateBin instances use the Content-Security-Policy
  header to prevent most use-cases of this vulnerability. This report will describe
  the impact as if this header had been disabled by the PrivateBin instance owner."
