package_slug: "packagist/privatebin/privatebin"
title: "PrivateBin allows shortening of URLs for other domains"
description: "In [v1.5](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#15-2022-12-11)
  we introduced the YOURLS server-side proxy. The idea was to allow using the YOURLs
  URL shortener without running the YOURLs instance without authentication and/or
  exposing the authentication token to the public, allowing anyone to shorten any
  URL. With the proxy mechanism, anyone can shorten any URL pointing to the configured
  PrivateBin instance. The vulnerability allowed other URLs to be shortened, as long
  as they contain the PrivateBin instance, defeating the limit imposed by the proxy.\n\nNeither
  the confidentially of existing pastes on the server nor the configuration options
  including the YOURLs token are affected."
