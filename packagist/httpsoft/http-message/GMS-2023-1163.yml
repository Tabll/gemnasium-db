title: "Improper header validation in httpsoft/http-message"
description: "### Impact\n\nImproper header parsing. An attacker could sneak in a
  newline (`\\n`) into both the header names and values. While the specification states
  that `\\r\\n\\r\\n` is used to terminate the header list, many servers in the wild will
  also accept `\\n\\n`.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue is patched in 1.0.12.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere
  are no known workarounds.\n\n### References\n\n* https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7230#section-3.2.4"
