title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "Laravel is a web application framework. Laravel contain a possible cross-site
  scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Blade templating engine. A broken HTML element
  may be clicked and the user taken to another location in their browser due to XSS.
  This is due to the user being able to guess the parent placeholder SHA-1 hash by
  trying common names of sections. If the parent template contains an exploitable
  HTML structure an XSS vulnerability can be exposed. This vulnerability has been
  patched by determining the parent placeholder at runtime and using a random hash
  that is unique to each request."
