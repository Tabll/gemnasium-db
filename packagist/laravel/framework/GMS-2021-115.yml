title: "SQL Server LIMIT / OFFSET SQL Injection in laravel/framework and illuminate/database"
description: "### Impact\n\nThose using SQL Server with Laravel and allowing user
  input to be passed directly to the `limit` and `offset` functions are vulnerable
  to SQL injection. Other database drivers such as MySQL and Postgres are not affected
  by this vulnerability.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis problem has been patched on Laravel
  versions 6.20.26, 7.30.5, and 8.40.0.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nYou may workaround this
  vulnerability by ensuring that only integers are passed to the `limit` and `offset`
  functions, as well as the `skip` and `take` functions.\n"
