title: "Laravel Encrypter Component Potential Decryption Failure Leading to Unintended
  Behavior"
description: "The Laravel Encrypter component is susceptible to a vulnerability that
  may result in decryption failure, leading to an unexpected return of `false`. Exploiting
  this issue requires the attacker to manipulate the encrypted payload before decryption.
  When combined with weak type comparisons in the application's code, such as the
  example below:\n\n```\n<?php\n\n$decyptedValue = decrypt($secret);\n\nif ($decryptedValue
  == '') {\n// Code is run even though decrypted value is false...\n}\n```"
