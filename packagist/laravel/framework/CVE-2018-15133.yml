title: "Laravel Framework RCE Vulnerability"
description: "In Laravel Framework through 5.5.40 and 5.6.x through 5.6.29, remote
  code execution might occur as a result of an unserialize call on a potentially untrusted
  X-XSRF-TOKEN value. This involves the decrypt method in `Illuminate/Encryption/Encrypter.php`
  and PendingBroadcast in `gadgetchains/Laravel/RCE/3/chain.php` in phpggc. The attacker
  must know the application key, which normally would never occur, but could happen
  if the attacker previously had privileged access or successfully accomplished a
  previous attack."
