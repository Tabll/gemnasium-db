package_slug: "packagist/laravel/framework"
title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "In Laravel Framework through 5.5.40 and 5.6.x through 5.6.29, remote
  code execution might occur as a result of an unserialize call on a potentially untrusted
  X-XSRF-TOKEN value. This involves the decrypt method in Illuminate/Encryption/Encrypter.php
  and PendingBroadcast in gadgetchains/Laravel/RCE/3/chain.php in phpggc. The attacker
  must know the application key, which normally would never occur, but could happen
  if the attacker previously had privileged access or successfully accomplished a
  previous attack."
