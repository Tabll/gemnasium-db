title: "Laravel Reverb Missing API Signature Verification"
description: "A community member disclosed an issue where verification signatures
  for requests sent to Reverb's Pusher-compatible API were not being verified. This
  API is used in scenarios such as broadcasting a message from a backend service or
  for obtaining statistical information (such as number of connections) about a given
  channel.\n\nThe verification signature is a hash comprised of different parts of
  the request signed by the app's secret key. The signature is sent as part of the
  request and should be regenerated by Reverb. Only when both the signature in the
  request and the one generated by Reverb match should the request be allowed. This
  helps to verify the request came from a known source.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> This issue
  only affects the Pusher-compatible API endpoints and not the WebSocket connections
  themselves. In order to exploit this vulnerability, the application ID which, should
  never be exposed, would need to be known by an attacker.\n\nThe following endpoints
  were affected:\n\n```\nPOST /events\nPOST /events_batch\nGET /connections\nGET /channels\nGET
  /channel\nGET /channel_users\nPOST /users_terminate\n```"
