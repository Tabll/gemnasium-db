title: "Laravel Redis Horizontal Scaling Insecure Deserialization"
description: "This vulnerability affects Laravel Reverb versions prior to v1.7.0 when
  horizontal scaling is enabled (`REVERB_SCALING_ENABLED=true`).\n\nThe exploitability
  of this vulnerability is increased because Redis servers are commonly deployed without
  authentication.\n\nWith horizontal scaling enabled, Reverb servers communicate via
  Redis PubSub. Reverb previously passed data from the Redis channel directly into
  PHP’s `unserialize()` function without restricting which classes could be instantiated.\n\n**Risk:**
  Remote Code Execution (RCE)"
