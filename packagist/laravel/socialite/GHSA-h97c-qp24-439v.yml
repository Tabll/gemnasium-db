title: "Insecure State Generation in laravel/socialite"
description: "laravel/socialite versions prior to 2.0.9 are found to have an insecure
  state generation mechanism, potentially exposing the OAuth authentication process
  to security risks. The issue has been addressed in version 2.0.9 by ensuring that
  the state is generated using a truly random approach, enhancing the security of
  the OAuth flow."
