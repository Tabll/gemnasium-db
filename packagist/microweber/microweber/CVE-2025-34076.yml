title: "Microweber CMS API has authenticated local file inclusion vulnerability"
description: "An authenticated local file inclusion vulnerability exists in Microweber
  CMS versions < 1.2.11 through misuse of the backup management API. Authenticated
  users can abuse the /api/BackupV2/upload and /api/BackupV2/download endpoints to
  read arbitrary files from the underlying filesystem. By specifying an absolute file
  path in the src parameter of the upload request, the server may relocate or delete
  the target file depending on the web service userâ€™s privileges. The corresponding
  download endpoint can then be used to retrieve the file contents, effectively enabling
  local file disclosure. This behavior stems from insufficient validation of user-supplied
  paths and inadequate restrictions on file access and backup logic."
