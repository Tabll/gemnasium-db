package_slug: "packagist/microweber/microweber"
title: "Incorrect Authorization"
description: "Users Account Pre-Takeover or Users Account Takeover. in GitHub repository
  microweber/microweber prior to 1.2.15. Victim Account Take Over. Since, there is
  no email confirmation, an attacker can easily create an account in the application
  using the Victim’s Email. This allows an attacker to gain pre-authentication to
  the victim’s account. Further, due to the lack of proper validation of email coming
  from Social Login and failing to check if an account already exists, the victim
  will not identify if an account is already existing. Hence, the attacker’s persistence
  will remain. An attacker would be able to see all the activities performed by the
  victim user impacting the confidentiality and attempt to modify/corrupt the data
  impacting the integrity and availability factor. This attack becomes more interesting
  when an attacker can register an account from an employee’s email address. Assuming
  the organization uses G-Suite, it is much more impactful to hijack into an employee’s
  account."
