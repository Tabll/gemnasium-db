identifier: "CVE-2019-10905"
package_slug: "packagist/erusev/parsedown"
title: "Code Injection"
description: "Parsedown, when safe mode is used and HTML markup is disabled, might
  allow attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code if a script (already running
  on the affected page) executes the contents of any element with a specific class.
  This occurs because spaces are permitted in code block infostrings, which interferes
  with the intended behavior of a single class name beginning with the language- substring."
