title: "Bolt CMS vulnerable to authenticated remote code execution"
description: "Bolt CMS versions 3.7.0 and earlier contain a chain of vulnerabilities
  that together allow an authenticated user to achieve remote code execution. A user
  with valid credentials can inject arbitrary PHP code into the displayname field
  of the user profile, which is rendered unsanitized in backend templates. The attacker
  can then list and rename cached session files via the /async/browse/cache/.sessions
  and /async/folder/rename endpoints. By renaming a .session file to a path under
  the publicly accessible /files/ directory with a .php extension, the attacker can
  turn the injected code into an executable web shell. Finally, the attacker triggers
  the payload via a crafted HTTP GET request to the rogue file.\n\nNOTE: The vendor
  announced that Bolt 3 reached end-of-life after 31 December 2021."
