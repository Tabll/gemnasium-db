package_slug: "packagist/pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "Pimcore admin-ui-classic-bundle provides a Backend UI for Pimcore. The
  translation value with text including “%s” (from “%suggest%) is parsed by sprintf()
  even though it’s supposed to be output literally to the user. The translations may
  be accessible by a user with comparatively lower overall access (as the translation
  permission cannot be scoped to certain “modules”) and a skilled attacker might be
  able to exploit the parsing of the translation string in the dialog box. This issue
  has been patched in commit `abd77392` which is included in release 1.1.2. Users
  are advised to update to version 1.1.2 or apply the patch manually.\n"
