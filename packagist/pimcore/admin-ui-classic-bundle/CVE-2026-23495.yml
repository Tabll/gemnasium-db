title: "Pimcore's Admin Classic Bundle is Missing Function Level Authorization on
  \"Predefined Properties\" Listing"
description: "The API endpoint for listing Predefined Properties in the Pimcore platform
  lacks adequate server-side authorization checks. Predefined Properties are configurable
  metadata definitions (e.g., name, key, type, default value) used across documents,
  assets, and objects to standardize custom attributes and improve editorial workflows,
  as documented in Pimcore's official properties guide. Testing confirmed that an
  authenticated backend user without explicit permissions for property management
  could successfully call the endpoint and retrieve the complete list of these configurations.
  This exemplifies Broken Access Control (OWASP Top 10 A01:2021), enabling unauthorized
  access to administrative features and potentially violating role-based access controls
  inherent to Pimcore's multi-user environment."
