title: "Pimcore Web2Print Tools Bundle \"Favourite Output Channel Configuration\"
  Missing Function Level Authorization"
description: "The application fails to enforce proper server-side authorization checks
  on the API endpoint responsible for managing \"Favourite Output Channel Configurations.\"
  Testing revealed that an authenticated backend user without explicitely lacking
  permissions for this feature was still able to successfully invoke the endpoint
  and modify or retrieve these configurations. This violates the principle of least
  privilege and constitutes a classic example of Broken Access Control (OWASP Top
  10 A01:2021). Because authorization is not validated at the function level, any
  authenticated user can perform actions intended only for privileged roles, leading
  to horizontal or vertical privilege escalation."
