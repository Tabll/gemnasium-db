package_slug: "packagist/pimcore/pimcore"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')"
description: "Pimcore is an Open Source Data & Experience Management Platform. Pimcore
  offers developers listing classes to make querying data easier. This listing classes
  also allow to order or group the results based on one or more columns which should
  be quoted by default. The actual issue is that quoting is not done properly in both
  cases, so there's the theoretical possibility to inject custom SQL if the developer
  is using this methods with input data and not doing proper input validation in advance
  and so relies on the auto-quoting being done by the listing classes. This issue
  has been resolved in version 10.4.4. Users are advised to upgrade or to apple the
  patch manually. There are no known workarounds for this issue."
