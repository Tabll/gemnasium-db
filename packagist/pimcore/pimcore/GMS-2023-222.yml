description: "### Impact\nThe upload functionality for updating user profile does
  not properly validate the file content-type, allowing any authenticated user to
  bypass this security check by adding a valid signature (p.e. GIF89) and sending
  any invalid content-type. This could allow an authenticated attacker to upload HTML
  files with JS content that will be executed in the context of the domain.\n\n###
