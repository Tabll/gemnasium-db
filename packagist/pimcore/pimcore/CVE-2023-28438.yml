title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')"
description: "Pimcore is an open source data and experience management platform. Prior
  to version 10.5.19, since a user with 'report' permission can already write arbitrary
  SQL queries and given the fact that this endpoint is using the GET method (no CSRF
  protection), an attacker can inject an arbitrary query by manipulating a user to
  click on a link. Users should upgrade to version 10.5.19 to receive a patch or,
  as a workaround, may apply the patch manually."
