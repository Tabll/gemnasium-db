title: "Pimcore Has an Incomplete Patch for CVE-2023-30848"
description: "An **incomplete SQL injection patch** in the Admin Search Find API allows
  an authenticated attacker to perform **blind SQL injection**.\nAlthough CVE-2023-30848
  attempted to mitigate SQL injection by removing SQL comments (--) and catching syntax
  errors, the fix is insufficient. Attackers can still inject SQL payloads that do
  not rely on comments and infer database information via blind techniques. This vulnerability
  affects the admin interface and can lead to **database information disclosure**."
