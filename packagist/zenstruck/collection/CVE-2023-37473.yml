title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream
  Component ('Injection')"
description: "zenstruck/collections is a set of helpers for iterating/paginating/filtering
  collections. Passing _callable strings_ (ie `system`) caused the function to be
  executed. This would result in a limited subset of specific user input being executed
  as if it were code. This issue has been addressed in commit `f4b1c48820` and included
  in release version 0.2.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade
  should ensure that user input is not passed to either `EntityRepository::find()`
  or `query()`."
