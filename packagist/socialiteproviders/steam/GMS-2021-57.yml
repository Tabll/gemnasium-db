title: "Steam Socialite Provider v1 does not correctly validate openid server"
description: "### Impact\nThe outdated version 1 of the Steam Socialite Provider doesn't
  check properly if the login comes from `steamcommunity.com`, allowing a malicious
  actor to substitute their own openID server.\n\n### Patches\nThis vulnerability
  only affects the outdated v1.x versions of the package. These are no longer maintained,
  users should upgrade to v3 or v4, which use a hardcoded endpoint to verify the login.\n\n###
