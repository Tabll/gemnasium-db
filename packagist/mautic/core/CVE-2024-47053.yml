title: "Mautic allows Improper Authorization in Reporting API"
description: "This advisory addresses an authorization vulnerability in Mautic's HTTP
  Basic Authentication implementation. This flaw could allow unauthorized access to
  sensitive report data.\n\n* **Improper Authorization:** An authorization flaw exists
  in Mautic's API Authorization implementation. Any authenticated user, regardless
  of assigned roles or permissions, can access all reports and their associated data
  via the API.  This bypasses the intended access controls governed by the \"Reporting
  Permissions > View Own\" and \"Reporting Permissions > View Others\" permissions,
  which should restrict access to non-System Reports."
