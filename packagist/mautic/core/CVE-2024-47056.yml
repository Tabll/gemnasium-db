package_slug: "packagist/mautic/core"
title: "Mautic does not shield .env files from web traffic"
description: "This advisory addresses a security vulnerability in Mautic where sensitive
  `.env` configuration files may be directly accessible via a web browser. This exposure
  could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, including database credentials,
  API keys, and other critical system configurations.\n\nSensitive Information Disclosure
  via `.env` File Exposure: The `.env` file, which typically contains environment
  variables and sensitive application configurations, is directly accessible via a
  web browser due to missing web server configurations that restrict access to such
  files. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to view the contents of this file
  by simply navigating to its URL."
