title: "Mautic's Predictable Page Indexing Might Lead to Sensitive Data Exposure"
description: "This advisory addresses a security vulnerability in Mautic where unpublished
  page previews could be accessed by unauthenticated users and potentially indexed
  by search engines. This could lead to the unintended disclosure of draft content
  or sensitive information.\n\nUnauthorized Access to Unpublished Page Previews: The
  page preview functionality for unpublished content, accessible via predictable URLs
  (e.g., `/page/preview/1`, `/page/preview/2`), lacked proper authorization checks.
  This allowed any unauthenticated user to view content that was not yet intended
  for public release, and allowed search engines to index these private preview URLs,
  making the content publicly discoverable."
