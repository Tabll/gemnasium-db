identifier: "CVE-2021-27910"
package_slug: "packagist/mautic/core"
title: "Cross-site Scripting"
description: "Insufficient sanitization / filtering allows for arbitrary JavaScript
  Injection in Mautic using the bounce management callback function. An attacker with
  access to the bounce management callback function (identified with the Mailjet webhook,
  but it is assumed this will work uniformly across all kinds of webhooks) can inject
  arbitrary JavaScript Code into the `error` and `error_related_to` parameters of
  the POST request (`POST /mailer/<product / webhook>/callback`). It is noted that
  there is no authentication needed to access this function. The JavaScript Code is
  stored permanently in the web application and executed every time an authenticated
  user views the details page of a single contact / lead in Mautic. This means, arbitrary
  code can be executed to, e.g., steal or tamper with information."
