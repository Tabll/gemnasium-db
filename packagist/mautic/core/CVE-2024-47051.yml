title: "Mautic allows Remote Code Execution and File Deletion in Asset Uploads"
description: "This advisory addresses two critical security vulnerabilities present
  in Mautic versions before 5.2.3.  These vulnerabilities could be exploited by authenticated
  users.\n\n* **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Asset Upload:**  A Remote Code Execution
  vulnerability has been identified in the asset upload functionality. Insufficient
  enforcement of allowed file extensions allows an attacker to bypass restrictions
  and upload executable files, such as PHP scripts.\n\n* **Path Traversal File Deletion:**
  A Path Traversal vulnerability exists in the upload validation process.  Due to
  improper handling of path components, an authenticated user can manipulate the file
  deletion process to delete arbitrary files on the host system."
