package_slug: "packagist/mautic/core"
title: "Mautic vulnerable to Improper Access Control in UI upgrade process"
description: "The logic in place to facilitate the update process via the user interface
  lacks access control to verify if permission exists to perform the tasks. Prior
  to this patch being applied it might be possible for an attacker to access the Mautic
  version number or to execute parts of the upgrade process without permission. As
  upgrading in the user interface is deprecated, this functionality is no longer required."
