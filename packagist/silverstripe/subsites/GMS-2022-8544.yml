package_slug: "packagist/silverstripe/subsites"
title: "Subsite weakens file permissions"
description: "The subsites module can weaken edit restrictions on some files and allow
  a malicious user to edit files they do not have edit rights to.\n\nThis only affects
  projects with the subsites module installed. Regression testing should focus on
  custom file logic.\n\nBe advised that this is not a case of a user being able to
  edit a file in subsites they do not have access to. As a reminder, all separation
  of content achieved with the subsites module should be viewed as cosmetic and not
  appropriate for security-critical applications."
