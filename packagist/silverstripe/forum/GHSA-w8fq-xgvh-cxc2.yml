title: "Silverstripe Forum Module CSRF Vulnerability"
description: "A number of form actions in the Forum module are directly accessible.
  A malicious user (e.g. spammer) can use GET requests to create Members and post
  to forums, bypassing CSRF and anti-spam measures.\n\nAdditionally, a forum moderator
  could be tricked into clicking a specially crafted URL, resulting in a topic being
  moved.\n\nThanks to Michael Strong for discovering."
