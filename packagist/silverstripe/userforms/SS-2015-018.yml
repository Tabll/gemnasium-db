title: "File upload exposure"
description: "The userforms module allows CMS administrators to create public facing
  forms with file upload abilities. These files are uploaded into a predictable public
  path on the website, unless configured otherwise by the CMS administrator setting
  up the form. While the name of the uploaded file itself is not predictable, certain
  actions taken by CMS authors could expose it. For example, submission notification
  emails contain a link to the file without authorisation checks."
