title: "silverstripe/userforms file upload exposure on UserForms module"
description: "The [userforms module](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-userforms)
  allows CMS administrators to create public facing forms with file upload abilities.
  These files are uploaded into a predictable public path on the website, unless configured
  otherwise by the CMS administrator setting up the form. While the name of the uploaded
  file itself is not predictable, certain actions taken by CMS authors could expose
  it. For example, submission notification emails contain a link to the file without
  authorisation checks.\n\nIn 3.0.0 this field is disabled by default, but re-enabled
  upon installation of the [secure assets module](https://github.com/silverstripe-labs/silverstripe-secureassets).
  When this is installed, the field can once again be used within a form, and will
  automatically lock this folder to a secure list of users, which can then be configured
  further by an administrator.\n\nExisting file upload fields will not be disabled,
  but will require re-enabling via config or installation of secure assets to become
  editable again.\n\nIf any upload field points or is pointed to a folder that is
  not secured, and the secure assets module is present, then that folder will have
  the secure permissions applied automatically."
