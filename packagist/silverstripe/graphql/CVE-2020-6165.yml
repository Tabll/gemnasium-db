identifier: "CVE-2020-6165"
package_slug: "packagist/silverstripe/graphql"
title: "Incorrect Default Permissions"
description: "The automatic permission-checking mechanism in the `silverstripe/graphql`
  module does not provide complete protection against lists that are limited (e.g.,
  through pagination), resulting in records that should have failed a permission check
  being added to the final result set. GraphQL endpoints are configured by default
  (e.g., for assets), but the `admin/graphql` endpoint is access protected by default.
  This limits the vulnerability to all authenticated users, including those with limited
  permissions (e.g., where viewing records exposed through `admin/graphql` requires
  administrator permissions). However, if custom GraphQL endpoints have been configured
  for a specific implementation (usually under `/graphql`), this vulnerability could
  also be exploited through unauthenticated requests. This vulnerability only applies
  to reading records; it does not allow unauthorised changing of records."
