description: "`silverstripe/graphql` serves Silverstripe data as GraphQL representations.
  In versions 4.2.2 and 4.1.1, an attacker could use a specially crafted graphql query
  to execute a denial of service attack against a website which has a publicly exposed
  graphql endpoint. This mostly affects websites with particularly large/complex graphql
  schemas. Users should upgrade to `silverstripe/graphql` 4.2.3 or 4.1.2 to remedy
  the vulnerability."
