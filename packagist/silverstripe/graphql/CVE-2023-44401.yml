package_slug: "packagist/silverstripe/graphql"
title: "Incorrect Authorization"
description: "The Silverstripe CMS GraphQL Server serves Silverstripe data as GraphQL
  representations. In versions 4.0.0 prior to 4.3.7 and 5.0.0 prior to 5.1.3, `canView`
  permission checks are bypassed for ORM data in paginated GraphQL query results where
  the total number of records is greater than the number of records per page. Note
  that this also affects GraphQL queries which have a limit applied, even if the query
  isnâ€™t paginated per se. This has been fixed in versions 4.3.7 and 5.1.3 by ensuring
  no new records are pulled in from the database after performing `canView` permission
  checks for each page of results. This may result in some pages in the query results
  having less than the maximum number of records per page even when there are more
  pages of results. This behavior is consistent with how pagination works in other
  areas of Silverstripe CMS, such as in `GridField`, and is a result of having to
  perform permission checks in PHP rather than in the database directly. One may disable
  these permission checks by disabling the `CanViewPermission` plugin."
