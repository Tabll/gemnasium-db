package_slug: "packagist/silverstripe/admin"
title: "Incorrect Authorization"
description: "Silverstripe Admin provides a basic management interface for the Silverstripe
  Framework. In versions on the 1.x branch prior to 1.13.19 and on the 2.x branch
  prior to 2.1.8, users who don't have edit or delete permissions for records exposed
  in a `ModelAdmin` can still edit or delete records using the CSV import form, provided
  they have create permissions. The likelihood of a user having create permissions
  but not having edit or delete permissions is low, but it is possible. Note that
  this does not affect any `ModelAdmin` which has had the import form disabled via
  the `showImportForm` public property. Versions 1.13.19 and 2.1.8 contain a patch
  for the issue. Those who have a custom implementation of `BulkLoader` should update
  their implementations to respect permissions when the return value of `getCheckPermissions()`
  is true. Those who use any `BulkLoader` in their own project logic, or maintain
  a module which uses it, should consider passing `true` to `setCheckPermissions()`
  if the data is provided by users."
