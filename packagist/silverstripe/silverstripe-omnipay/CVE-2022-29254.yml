title: "Interpretation Conflict"
description: "silverstripe-omnipay is a SilverStripe integration with Omnipay PHP
  payments library. For a subset of Omnipay gateways (those that use intermediary
  states like `isNotification()` or `isRedirect()`), if the payment identifier or
  success URL is exposed it is possible for payments to be prematurely marked as completed
  without payment being taken. This is mitigated by the fact that most payment gateways
  hide this information from users, however some issuing banks offer flawed 3DSecure
  implementations that may inadvertently expose this data. The following versions
  have been patched to fix this issue: `2.5.2`, `3.0.2`, `3.1.4`, and `3.2.1`. There
  are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
