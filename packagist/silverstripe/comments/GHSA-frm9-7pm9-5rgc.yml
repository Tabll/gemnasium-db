title: "SilverStripe comments module includes version of jQuery vulnerable to Cross-site
  Scripting"
description: "The silverstripe/comments module, the cwp/starter-theme and the cwp/watea-theme
  include an outdated version of jQuery by default, which contains XSS vulnerabilities
  if user input is used in certain contexts. Though no known exploit has been found
  for these in the existing usage, user customisation to these themes could have made
  them exploitable.\n\nCWP 2.0.0 has been released with the fixed cwp/stater-theme
  and silverstripe/comments module, and SilverStripe 4.2.0 will be released with the
  fixed silverstripe-themes/simple theme."
