package_slug: "packagist/silverstripe/recipe-cms"
title: "Incorrect Default Permissions"
description: "SilverStripe 4.5.0 allows attackers to read certain records that should
  not have been placed into a result set. This affects silverstripe/recipe-cms. The
  automatic permission-checking mechanism in the silverstripe/graphql module does
  not provide complete protection against lists that are limited (e.g., through pagination),
  resulting in records that should have failed a permission check being added to the
  final result set. GraphQL endpoints are configured by default (e.g., for assets),
  but the admin/graphql endpoint is access protected by default. This limits the vulnerability
  to all authenticated users, including those with limited permissions (e.g., where
  viewing records exposed through admin/graphql requires administrator permissions).
  However, if custom GraphQL endpoints have been configured for a specific implementation
  (usually under /graphql), this vulnerability could also be exploited through unauthenticated
  requests. This vulnerability only applies to reading records; it does not allow
  unauthorised changing of records."
