description: "The SS_Report, and the reports CMS section only checks `canView()` when
  listing the reports that can be viewed by the current user.\n\nIt does not (and
  should) perform `canView` checks when the report is actually viewed, so if you know
  the URL to a report and can otherwise access the Reports section of the CMS, you
  can view any report."
