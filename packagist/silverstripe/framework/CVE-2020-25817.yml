identifier: "CVE-2020-25817"
package_slug: "packagist/silverstripe/framework"
title: "Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference"
description: "SilverStripe has an XXE Vulnerability in CSSContentParser. A developer
  utility meant for parsing HTML within unit tests can be vulnerable to XML External
  Entity (XXE) attacks. When this developer utility is misused for purposes involving
  external or user submitted data in custom project code, it can lead to vulnerabilities
  such as XSS on HTML output rendered through this custom code. This is now mitigated
  by disabling external entities during parsing."
