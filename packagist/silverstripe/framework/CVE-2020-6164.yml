identifier: "CVE-2020-6164"
package_slug: "packagist/silverstripe/framework"
title: "Information Exposure"
description: "In SilverStripe, a specific URL path configured by default through the
  silverstripe/framework module can be used to disclose the fact that a domain is
  hosting a Silverstripe application. There is no disclosure of the specific version.
  The functionality on this URL path is limited to execution in a CLI context, and
  is not known to present a vulnerability through web-based access. As a side effect,
  this preconfigured path also blocks the creation of other resources on this path
  (e.g. a page)."
