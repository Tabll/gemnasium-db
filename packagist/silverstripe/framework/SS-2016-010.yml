title: "ReadOnly transformation for formfields exploitable"
description: "Form fields returning `isReadonly()` as true are vulnerable to reflected
  XSS injections. This includes `ReadonlyField`, `LookupField`, `HTMLReadonlyField`,
  as well as special purpose fields like `TimeField_Readonly`. Values submitted to
  through these form fields are not filtered out from the form session data, and might
  be shown to the user depending on the form behaviour. For example, form validation
  errors cause the form to re-render with previously submitted values by default.
  SilverStripe forms automatically load values from request data (GET and POST), which
  enables malicious use of URLs if your form uses these fields and does not overwrite
  data on form construction. Readonly and disabled form fields are already filtered
  out in `saveInto()`, so maliciously submitted data on these fields does not make
  it into the database unless you are accessing form values directly in your saving
  logic."
