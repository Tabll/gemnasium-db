title: "silverstripe/framework ReadOnly transformation for formfields exploitable"
description: "Form fields returning isReadonly() as true are vulnerable to reflected
  XSS injections. This includes ReadonlyField, LookupField, HTMLReadonlyField, as
  well as special purpose fields like TimeField_Readonly. Values submitted to through
  these form fields are not filtered out from the form session data, and might be
  shown to the user depending on the form behaviour. For example, form validation
  errors cause the form to re-render with previously submitted values by default.\n\nSilverStripe
  forms automatically load values from request data (GET and POST), which enables
  malicious use of URLs if your form uses these fields and doesn't overwrite data
  on form construction.\n\nReadonly and disabled form fields are already filtered
  out in Form->saveInto(), so maliciously submitted data on these fields doesn't make
  it into the database unless you are accessing form values directly in your saving
  logic."
