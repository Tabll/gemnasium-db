title: "silverstripe/framework's URL parameters `isDev` and `isTest` unguarded"
description: "The URL parameters `isDev` and `isTest` are accessible to unauthenticated
  users who access a SilverStripe website or application. This allows unauthorised
  users to expose information that is usually hidden on production environments such
  as verbose errors (including backtraces) and other debugging tools only available
  to sites running in \"dev mode\". Core functionality does not expose user data through
  these methods. Depending on your website configuration, community modules might
  have added more specific functionality which can be used to either access or alter
  user data.\n\nWe have fixed the usage of isDev and isTest in SilverStripe 4.x, and
  removed the URL parameters in the next major release of SilverStripe."
