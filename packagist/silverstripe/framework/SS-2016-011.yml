title: "ChangePasswordForm doesn't check Member::canLogIn()"
description: "After performing a password reset, `ChangePasswordForm::doChangePassword()`
  logs in the user without checking `Member::canLogIn()`. This presents an issue for
  sites that are using the extension point in that method to deny access to users
  (for example members that have not been “approved”, or members that have had their
  access revoked temporarily). It looks like `Member::canLogIn()` was originally designed
  to only be used for checking whether the user is locked out (due to too many incorrect
  login attempts) but has been opened up to other uses. "
