title: "Silverstripe X-Forwarded-Host request hostname injection"
description: "A potential hostname injection vulnerability has been found which could
  allow attackers to alter url resolution.\n\nIf a request contains the X-Forwarded-Host
  HTTP header a website would then use its value in place of the actual HTTP hostname.
  In cases where caching is enabled, this could allow an attacker to potentially embed
  a remote url as the base_url for any site. This would then cause other visitors
  to the site to be redirected unknowingly.\n\nThis header is necessary for servers
  running behind a reverse proxy (such as nginx). Such servers are likely not vulnerable
  to this risk.\n\nA fix has been merged into the default installer, although existing
  projects which do not run behind a reverse proxy should update their htaccess as
  below:\n```\n<IfModule mod_headers.c>"
