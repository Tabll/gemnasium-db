title: "silverstripe/framework Privilege Escalation Risk in Member Edit form"
description: "A member with the permission `EDIT_PERMISSIONS` and access to the \"Security\"
  section is able to re-assign themselves (or another member) to `ADMIN` level.\n\nCMS
  Fields for the member are constructed using DirectGroups instead of Groups relation
  which results in bypassing security logic preventing privilege escalation."
