title: "VersionedRequestFilter vulnerability"
description: "A cross-site scripting vulnerability in `VersionedRequestFilter` has
  been found. If an incoming user request should not be able to access the requested
  stage, an error message is created for display on the CMS login page that they are
  redirected to. In this error message, the URL of the requested page is interpolated
  into the error message without being escaped; hence, arbitrary HTML can be injected
  into the CMS login page."
