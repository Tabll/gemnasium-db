package_slug: "packagist/silverstripe/framework"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "Silverstripe Framework is the MVC framework that powers Silverstripe
  CMS. When a new member record is created and a password is not set, an empty encrypted
  password is generated. As a result, if someone is aware of the existence of a member
  record associated with a specific email address, they can potentially attempt to
  log in using that empty password. Although the default member authenticator and
  login form require a non-empty password, alternative authentication methods might
  still permit a successful login with the empty password. This issue has been patched
  in versions 4.13.4 and 5.0.13.\n\n\n"
