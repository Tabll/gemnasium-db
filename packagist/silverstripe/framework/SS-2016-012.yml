title: "Missing ACL on reports"
description: "The `SS_Report`, and the reports CMS section only checks `canView()`
  when listing the reports that can be viewed by the current user. It does not (and
  should) perform `canView` checks when the report is actually viewed, so if you know
  the URL to a report and can otherwise access the Reports section of the CMS, you
  can view any report."
