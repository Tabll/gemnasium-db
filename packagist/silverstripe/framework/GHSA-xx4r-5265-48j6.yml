title: "silverstripe/framework SQL injection in full text search "
description: "When performing a fulltext search in SilverStripe 4.0.0 the 'start'
  querystring parameter is never escaped safely. This exposes a possible SQL injection
  vulnerability.\n\nThe issue exists in 3.5 and 3.6 but is less vulnerable, as SearchForm
  sanitises these variables prior to passing to mysql."
