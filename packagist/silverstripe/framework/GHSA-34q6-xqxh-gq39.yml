title: "Silverstripe XSS In rewritten hash links"
description: "A high level XSS vulnerability has been discovered in the SilverStripe
  framework which causes links containing hash anchors (E.g. href=\"#anchor\") to
  be rewritten in an unsafe way.\n\nThe rewriteHashlinks option on SSViewer will rewrite
  these to contain the current url, although without adequate escaping, meaning that
  HTML could be injected via injecting unsafe values to any page via the querystring.\n\nDue
  to the nature of this issue it is likely that a large number of SilverStripe sites
  are affected."
