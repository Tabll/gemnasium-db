title: "Silverstripe HtmlEditor embed url sanitisation"
description: "\"Add from URL\" doesn't clearly sanitise URL server side\n\nHtmlEditorField_Toolbar
  has an action HtmlEditorField_Toolbar#viewfile, which gets called by the CMS when
  adding a media \"from a URL\" (i.e. via oembed).\n\nThis action gets the URL to
  add in the GET parameter FileURL. However it doesn't do any URL sanitising server
  side. The current logic will pass this through to Oembed, which will probably reject
  most dangerous URLs, but it's possible future changes would break this."
