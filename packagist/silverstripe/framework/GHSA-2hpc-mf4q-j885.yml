title: "Silverstripe CSRF vulnerability in GridFieldAddExistingAutocompleter"
description: "GridField does not have sufficient CSRF protection, meaning that in
  some cases users with CMS access can be tricked into posting unspecified data into
  the CMS from external websites. Amongst other default CMS interfaces, GridField
  is used for management of groups, users and permissions in the CMS.\n\nThe resolution
  for this issue is to ensure that all gridFieldAlterAction submissions are checked
  for the SecurityID token during submission."
