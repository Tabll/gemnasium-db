package_slug: "packagist/silverstripe/framework"
title: "Silverstripe Framework has a Cross-site Scripting vulnerability with encoded
  payload"
description: "A bad actor with access to edit content in the CMS could send a specifically
  crafted encoded payload to the server, which could be used to inject a JavaScript
  payload on the front end of the site. The payload would be sanitised on the client-side,
  but server-side sanitisation doesn't catch it.\n\nThe server-side sanitisation logic
  has been updated to sanitise against this type of attack."
