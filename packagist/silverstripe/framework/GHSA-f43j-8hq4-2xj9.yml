title: "silverstripe/framework uploaded PHP script execution in assets"
description: "A weakness in the .htaccess rules preventing requests to uploaded PHP
  scripts allows PHP scripts that had made their way into the assets directory to
  be successfully executed through the use of a specially crafted URL. There are protections
  in place to disallow upload of PHP scripts through the CMS, meaning this weakness
  does not lead to direct vulnerabilities.\n\nIn addition, sites hosted on the New
  Zealand Common Web Platform or SilverStripe Platform have additional configuration
  in place which prevents PHP script execution in assets, even in a malicious party
  manages to upload these into the folder."
