title: "silverstripe/framework CSV Excel Macro Injection"
description: "In the CSV export feature of the CMS it's possible for the output to
  contain macros and scripts, which if imported without sanitisation into software
  (including Microsoft Excel) may be executed.\n\nIn order to safeguard against this
  threat all potentially executable cell values exported from CSV will be prepended
  with a literal tab character."
