title: "Silverstripe External redirection risk in Security?ReturnURL"
description: "A vulnerability has been found in the SilverStripe framework where a
  login url can be potentially redirected to an external site.\n\nFor example, the
  url http://www.my-silverstripe-site.com/Security/login?BackURL=/\\attacker-site.com
  will redirect successful logins to the page http://attacker-site.com. If that website
  were set up to look identical to the first with \"login failed\" then the user will
  likely just enter their user/pass again."
