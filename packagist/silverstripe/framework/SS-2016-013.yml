title: "Member.Name isn't escaped"
description: "The core template `framework/templates/Includes/GridField_print.ss`
  uses \"Printed by $Member.Name\". If the currently logged in members first name
  or surname contain XSS, this prints the raw HTML out, because `Member->getName()`
  just returns the raw `FirstName + Surname` as a string, which is injected directly."
