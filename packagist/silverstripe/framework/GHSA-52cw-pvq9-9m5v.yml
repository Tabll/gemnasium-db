title: "Silverstripe uses TinyMCE which allows svg files linked in object tags"
description: "TinyMCE v6 has a configuration value `convert_unsafe_embeds` set to
  `false` which allows svg files containing javascript to be used in `<object>` or
  `<embed>` tags, which can be used as a vector for XSS attacks.\n\nNote that `<embed>`
  tags are not allowed by default.\n\nAfter patching the default value of `convert_unsafe_embeds`
  will be set to `true`. This means that `<object>` tags will be converted to iframes
  instead the next time the page is saved, which may break any pages that rely upon
  previously saved `<object>` tags. Developers can override this configuration if
  desired to revert to the original behaviour.\n\nWe reviewed the potential impact
  of this vulnerability within the context of Silverstripe CMS. We concluded this
  is a medium impact vulnerability given how TinyMCE is used by Silverstripe CMS."
