title: "Silverstripe Missing security check on dev/build/defaults"
description: "The buildDefaults method on DevelopmentAdmin is missing a permission
  check.\n\nIn live mode, if you access /dev/build, you are requested to login first.
  However, if you access /dev/build/defaults, then the action is performed without
  any login check. This should be protected in the same way that /dev/build is.\nThe
  buildDefaults view is requireDefaultRecords() on each DataObject class, and hence
  has the potential to modify database state. It also lists all modified tables, allowing
  attackers more insight into which modules are used, and how the database tables
  are structured."
