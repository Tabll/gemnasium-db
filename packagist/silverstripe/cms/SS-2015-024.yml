title: "Queued jobs serialised data exposure"
description: "SavedJobData and SavedJobMessages contain php serialized data. There's
  no point showing these to a CMS Admin as they're not human readable. Worse, it might
  be insecure, as a malicious CMS Admin might be able to craft a payload thats dangerous
  to unserialize. This issue has been resolved by hiding this content, even from administrators."
