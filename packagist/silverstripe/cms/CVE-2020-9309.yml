package_slug: "packagist/silverstripe/cms"
title: "Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type"
description: "Silverstripe CMS through 4.5 can be susceptible to script execution
  from malicious upload contents under allowed file extensions (for example HTML code
  in a TXT file). When these files are stored as protected or draft files, the MIME
  detection can cause browsers to execute the file contents. Uploads stored as protected
  or draft files are allowed by default for authorised users only, but can also be
  enabled through custom logic as well as modules such as silverstripe/userforms.
  Sites using the previously optional silverstripe/mimevalidator module can configure
  MIME allow lists rather than extension allow lists, and hence prevent this issue.
  Sites on the Common Web Platform (CWP) use this module by default, and are not affected."
