title: "Silverstripe SiteTree Creation Permission Vulnerability"
description: "A vulnerability exists in the permission validation for SiteTree object
  creation. By default user permissions are not validated by the SiteTree::canCreate
  method, unless overridden by user code or via the configuration system.\n\nThis
  vulnerability will allow users, or unauthenticated guests, to create new SiteTree
  objects in the database. This vulnerability is present when such users are given
  CMS access via other means, or if there is another mechanism (such as RestfulServer
  module) which allows model editing and relies on model-level permission checks.\n\nThis
  vulnerability is restricted to the creation of draft or live pages, and does not
  allow users to edit, publish, or unpublish existing pages.\n\nAll users should upgrade
  as soon as possible."
