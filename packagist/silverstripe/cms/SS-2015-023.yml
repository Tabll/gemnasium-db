title: "Advanced workflow member field exposure"
description: "By default, the CMS Admin editable template for the NotifyUsers action
  has access to a large number of fields, including (for instance) `Member#Password`.
  This would allow a malicious CMS Admin to extract other admin passwords by adding
  a template emailing these fields to themselves when other admins trigger the workflow.
  A new configuration option has been added; when this option is set to `true` via
  the Config API then only member fields specified via `Member.summary_fields` may
  be accessed."
