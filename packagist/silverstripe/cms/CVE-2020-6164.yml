description: "In SilverStripe through 4.5.0, a specific URL path configured by default
  through the silverstripe/framework module can be used to disclose the fact that
  a domain is hosting a Silverstripe application. There is no disclosure of the specific
  version. The functionality on this URL path is limited to execution in a CLI context,
  and is not known to present a vulnerability through web-based access. As a side-effect,
  this preconfigured path also blocks the creation of other resources on this path
  (e.g. a page)."
