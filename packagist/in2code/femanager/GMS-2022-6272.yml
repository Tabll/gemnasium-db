title: "TYPO3 Extension femanager vulnerable to Broken Access Control"
description: "The TYPO3 Extension femanager prior to versions 5.5.2, 6.3.3, and 7.0.1
  is vulnerable to broken access control. The `usergroup.inList` validation can be
  bypassed resulting in new frontend users created by the extension may be members
  of groups that are restricted. The vulnerability is only exploitable if the field
  usergroup is available in the registration form. Versions 5.5.2, 6.3.3, and 7.0.1
  contain patches."
