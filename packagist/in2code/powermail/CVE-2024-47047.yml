title: "powermail TYPO3 extension has Insecure Direct Object Reference"
description: "An issue was discovered in the powermail extension through 12.4.0 for
  TYPO3. It fails to validate the mail parameter of the createAction, resulting in
  Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in some configurations. An unauthenticated
  attacker can use this to display user-submitted data of all forms persisted by the
  extension. The fixed versions are 7.5.1, 8.5.1, 10.9.1, and 12.4.1."
