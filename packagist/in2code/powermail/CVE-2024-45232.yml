title: "\"powermail\" (powermail) Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)"
description: "An issue was discovered in powermail extension through 12.3.5 for TYPO3.
  It fails to validate the mail parameter of the confirmationAction, resulting in
  Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR). An unauthenticated attacker can use this
  to display the user-submitted data of all forms persisted by the extension. This
  can only be exploited when the extension is configured to save submitted form data
  to the database (`plugin.tx_powermail.settings.db.enable=1`), which however is the
  default setting of the extension. The fixed versions are 7.5.0, 8.5.0, 10.9.0, and
  12.4.0."
