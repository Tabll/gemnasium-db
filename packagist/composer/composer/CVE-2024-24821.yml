title: "Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere"
description: "Composer is a dependency Manager for the PHP language. In affected versions
  several files within the local working directory are included during the invocation
  of Composer and in the context of the executing user. As such, under certain conditions
  arbitrary code execution may lead to local privilege escalation, provide lateral
  user movement or malicious code execution when Composer is invoked within a directory
  with tampered files. All Composer CLI commands are affected, including composer.phar's
  self-update. The following scenarios are of high risk: Composer being run with sudo,
  Pipelines which may execute Composer on untrusted projects, Shared environments
  with developers who run Composer individually on the same project. This vulnerability
  has been addressed in versions 2.7.0 and 2.2.23. It is advised that the patched
  versions are applied at the earliest convenience. Where not possible, the following
  should be addressed: Remove all sudo composer privileges for all users to mitigate
  root privilege escalation, and avoid running Composer within an untrusted directory,
  or if needed, verify that the contents of `vendor/composer/InstalledVersions.php`
  and `vendor/composer/installed.php` do not include untrusted code. A reset can also
  be done on these files by the following:```sh\nrm vendor/composer/installed.php
  vendor/composer/InstalledVersions.php\ncomposer install --no-scripts --no-plugins\n```"
