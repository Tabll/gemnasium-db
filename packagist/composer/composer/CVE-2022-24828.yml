package_slug: "packagist/composer/composer"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "Composer is a dependency manager for the PHP programming language. Integrators
  using Composer code to call `VcsDriver::getFileContent` can have a code injection
  vulnerability if the user can control the `$file` or `$identifier` argument. This
  leads to a vulnerability on packagist.org for example where the composer.json's
  `readme` field can be used as a vector for injecting parameters into hg/Mercurial
  via the `$file` argument, or git via the `$identifier` argument if you allow arbitrary
  data there (Packagist does not, but maybe other integrators do). Composer itself
  should not be affected by the vulnerability as it does not call `getFileContent`
  with arbitrary data into `$file`/`$identifier`. To the best of our knowledge this
  was not abused, and the vulnerability has been patched on packagist.org and Private
  Packagist within a day of the vulnerability report."
