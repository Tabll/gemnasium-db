title: "Composer is vulnerable to ANSI sequence injection"
description: "Attackers controlling remote sources that Composer downloads from might
  in some way inject ANSI control characters in the terminal output of various Composer
  commands, causing mangled output and potentially leading to confusion or DoS of
  the terminal application.\n\nThere is no proven exploit and this has thus a low
  severity but Composer still published a CVE as it has potential for abuse, and Composer
  wants to be on the safe side informing users that they should upgrade."
