title: "TYPO3 Scheduler Module vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery"
description: "### Problem\nA vulnerability has been identified in the backend user
  interface functionality involving deep links. Specifically, this functionality is
  susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Additionally, state-changing actions
  in downstream components incorrectly accepted submissions via HTTP GET and did not
  enforce the appropriate HTTP method.\n\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability
  requires the victim to have an active session on the backend user interface and
  to be deceived into interacting with a malicious URL targeting the backend, which
  can occur under the following conditions:\n\n* the user opens a malicious link,
  such as one sent via email.\n* the user visits a compromised or manipulated website
  while the following settings are misconfigured:\n  + `security.backend.enforceReferrer`
  feature is disabled,\n  + `BE/cookieSameSite` configuration is set to `lax` or `none`\n\nThe
  vulnerability in the affected downstream component “Scheduler Module” allows attackers
  to trigger pre-defined command classes - which can lead to unauthorized import or
  export of data in the worst case.\n\n### Solution\nUpdate to TYPO3 versions 11.5.42
  ELTS that fixes the problem described.\n\n### Credits\nThanks to Gabriel Dimitrov
  who reported this issue and to TYPO3 core and security members Benjamin Franzke,
  Oliver Hader, Andreas Kienast, Torben Hansen, Elias Häußler who fixed the issue.\n\n###
