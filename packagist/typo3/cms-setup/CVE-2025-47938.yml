package_slug: "packagist/typo3/cms-setup"
title: "TYPO3 Unverified Password Change for Backend Users"
description: "### Problem\nThe backend user management interface allows password changes
  without requiring the current password. When an administrator updates their own
  account or modifies other user accounts via the admin interface, the current password
  is not requested for verification.\n\nThis behavior may lower the protection against
  unauthorized access in scenarios where an admin session is hijacked or left unattended,
  as it enables password changes without additional authentication.\n\n### Solution\nUpdate
  to TYPO3 versions 9.5.51 ELTS, 10.4.50 ELTS, 11.5.44 ELTS, 12.4.31 LTS, 13.4.12
  LTS that fix the problem described.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> In these versions, administrators
  are required to verify their identity through step-up authentication (also known
  as sudo mode) when changing backend user passwords.\n\n### Credits\nThanks to the
  National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) of Switzerland for reporting this issue, and
  to TYPO3 core & security team member Benjamin Franzke for fixing it."
