package_slug: "packagist/typo3/html-sanitizer"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "TYPO3 HTML Sanitizer is an HTML sanitizer, written in PHP, aiming to
  provide cross-site-scripting-safe markup based on explicitly allowed tags, attributes
  and values. Starting in version 1.0.0 and prior to versions 1.5.1 and 2.1.2, due
  to an encoding issue in the serialization layer, malicious markup nested in a `noscript`
  element was not encoded correctly. `noscript` is disabled in the default configuration,
  but might have been enabled in custom scenarios. This allows bypassing the cross-site
  scripting mechanism of TYPO3 HTML Sanitizer. Versions 1.5.1 and 2.1.2 fix the problem."
