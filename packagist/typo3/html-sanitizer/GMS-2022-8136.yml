package_slug: "packagist/typo3/html-sanitizer"
title: "Duplicate of ./packagist/typo3/html-sanitizer/CVE-2022-23499.yml"
description: "Due to a parsing issue in the upstream package `masterminds/html5`,
  malicious markup used in a sequence with special HTML CDATA sections cannot be filtered
  and sanitized. This allows bypassing the cross-site scripting mechanism of `typo3/html-sanitizer`.
  Besides that, the upstream package `masterminds/html5` provides HTML raw text elements
  (`script`, `style`, `noframes`, `noembed` and `iframe`) as DOMText nodes, which
  were not processed and sanitized further. None of the mentioned elements were defined
  in the default builder configuration, that's why only custom behaviors, using one
  of those tag names, were vulnerable to cross-site scripting.\n\n### Solution\nUpdate
  to `typo3/html-sanitizer` versions 1.5.0 or 2.1.1 that fix the problem described.\n"
