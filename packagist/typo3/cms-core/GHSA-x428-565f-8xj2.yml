title: "TYPO3 Arbitrary Code Execution and Cross-Site Scripting in Backend API"
description: "Backend API configuration using Page TSconfig is vulnerable to arbitrary
  code execution and cross-site scripting. TSconfig fields of page properties in backend
  forms can be used to inject malicious sequences. Field tsconfig_includes is vulnerable
  to directory traversal leading to same scenarios as having direct access to TSconfig
  settings.\n\nA valid backend user account having access to modify values for fields
  `pages.TSconfig` and `pages.tsconfig_includes` is needed in order to exploit this
  vulnerability."
