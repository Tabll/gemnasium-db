title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system released
  under the GNU GPL. It has been discovered that the expiration time of a password
  reset link for TYPO3 backend users has never been evaluated. As a result, a password
  reset link could be used to perform a password reset even if the default expiry
  time of two hours has been exceeded. Update to TYPO3 version 10.4.32 or 11.5.16
  that fix the problem. There are no known workarounds for this issue."
