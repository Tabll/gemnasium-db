  is vulnerable to Insecure Deserialization when being used with the additional PHP
  PECL package `yaml`, which is capable of unserializing YAML contents to PHP objects.
  A valid backend user account as well as having PHP setting `yaml.decode_php` enabled
  is needed to exploit this vulnerability (which is the default value according to
  PHP documentation)."
