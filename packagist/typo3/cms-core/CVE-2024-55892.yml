title: "TYPO3 Potential Open Redirect via Parsing Differences"
description: "### Problem\nApplications that use `TYPO3\\CMS\\Core\\Http\\Uri` to
  parse externally provided URLs (e.g., via a query parameter) and validate the host
  of the parsed URL may be vulnerable to open redirect or SSRF attacks if the URL
  is used after passing the validation checks.\n\n### Solution\nUpdate to TYPO3 versions
  9.5.49 ELTS, 10.4.48 ELTS, 11.5.42 ELTS, 12.4.25 LTS, 13.4.3 LTS that fix the problem
  described.\n\n### Credits\nThanks to Sam Mush and Christian EÃŸl who reported this
  issue and to TYPO3 core & security team member Benjamin Franzke who fixed the issue.\n\n###
