title: "TYPO3 CMS Authentication Bypass vulnerability"
description: "It has been discovered that TYPO3â€™s Salted Password system extension
  (which is a mandatory system component) is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass when
  using hashing methods which are related by PHP class inheritance. In standard TYPO3
  core distributions stored passwords using the blowfish hashing algorithm can be
  overridden when using MD5 as the default hashing algorithm by just knowing a valid
  username. Per default the Portable PHP hashing algorithm (PHPass) is used which
  is not vulnerable."
