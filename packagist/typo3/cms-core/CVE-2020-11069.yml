identifier: "CVE-2020-11069"
package_slug: "packagist/typo3/cms-core"
title: "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
description: "In TYPO3 CMS, it has been discovered that the backend user interface
  and install tool are vulnerable to a same-site request forgery. A backend user can
  be tricked into interacting with a malicious resource an attacker previously managed
  to upload to the web server. Scripts are then executed with the privileges of the
  victims' user session. In a worst-case scenario, new admin users can be created
  which can directly be used by an attacker. The vulnerability is basically a cross-site
  request forgery (CSRF) triggered by a cross-site scripting vulnerability (XSS).
  Malicious payload such as HTML containing JavaScript might be provided by either
  an authenticated backend user or by a non-authenticated user using a third party
  extension, e.g., file upload in a contact form with knowing the target location.
  To be successful, the attacked victim requires an active and valid backend or install
  tool user session at the time of the attack."
