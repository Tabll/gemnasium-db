title: "TYPO3 Arbitrary Code Execution via File List Module"
description: "Due to missing file extensions in $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['BE'][‘fileDenyPattern’],
  backend users are allowed to upload *.phar, *.shtml, *.pl or *.cgi files which can
  be executed in certain web server setups. A valid backend user account is needed
  in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nDerivatives of Debian GNU Linux are handling
  *.phar files as PHP applications since PHP 7.1 (for unofficial packages) and PHP
  7.2 (for official packages).\n\nThe file extension *.shtml is bound to server side
  includes which are not enabled per default in most common Linux based distributions.
  File extension *.pl and *.cgi require additional handlers to be configured which
  is also not the case in most common distributions (except for /cgi-bin/ location)."
