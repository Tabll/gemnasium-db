title: "TYPO3 Insecure Deserialization in Query Generator & Query View"
description: "An issue was discovered in TYPO3 before 8.7.30, 9.x before 9.5.12, and
  10.x before 10.2.2. It has been discovered that the classes QueryGenerator and QueryView
  are vulnerable to insecure deserialization. One exploitable scenario requires having
  the system extension ext:lowlevel (Backend Module: DB Check) installed, with a valid
  backend user who has administrator privileges. The other exploitable scenario requires
  having the system extension ext:sys_action installed, with a valid backend user
  who has limited privileges."
