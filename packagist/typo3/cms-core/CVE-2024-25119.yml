package_slug: "packagist/typo3/cms-core"
title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system released
  under the GNU GPL. The plaintext value of `$GLOBALS['SYS']['encryptionKey']` was
  displayed in the editing forms of the TYPO3 Install Tool user interface. This allowed
  attackers to utilize the value to generate cryptographic hashes used for verifying
  the authenticity of HTTP request parameters. Exploiting this vulnerability requires
  an administrator-level backend user account with system maintainer permissions.
  Users are advised to update to TYPO3 versions 8.7.57 ELTS, 9.5.46 ELTS, 10.4.43
  ELTS, 11.5.35 LTS, 12.4.11 LTS, 13.0.1 that fix the problem described. There are
  no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
