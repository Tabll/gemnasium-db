package_slug: "packagist/typo3/cms-core"
title: "Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm"
description: "In TYPO3 CMS greater than or equal to 9.0.0 and less than 9.5.20, and
  greater than or equal to 10.0.0 and less than 10.4.6, it has been discovered that
  an internal verification mechanism can be used to generate arbitrary checksums.
  This allows to inject arbitrary data having a valid cryptographic message authentication
  code (HMAC-SHA1) and can lead to various attack chains including potential privilege
  escalation, insecure deserialization & remote code execution. The overall severity
  of this vulnerability is high based on mentioned attack chains and the requirement
  of having a valid backend user session (authenticated). This has been patched in
  versions 9.5.20 and 10.4.6."
