title: "TYPO3 Allows Information Disclosure via DBAL Restriction Handling"
description: "### Problem\nWhen performing a database query involving multiple tables
  through the database abstraction layer (DBAL), frontend user permissions are only
  applied via `FrontendGroupRestriction` to the last table. As a result, data from
  additional tables included in the same query may be unintentionally exposed to unauthorized
  users.\n\n### Solution\nUpdate to TYPO3 versions 9.5.51 ELTS, 10.4.50 ELTS, 11.5.44
  ELTS, 12.4.31 LTS, 13.4.12 LTS that fix the problem described.\n\n### Credits\nThanks
  to Christian Futterlieb for reporting this issue, and to TYPO3 security team member
  Elias Häußler for fixing it."
