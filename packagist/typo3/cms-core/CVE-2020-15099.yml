package_slug: "packagist/typo3/cms-core"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "In TYPO3 CMS greater than or equal to 9.0.0 and less than 9.5.20, and
  greater than or equal to 10.0.0 and less than 10.4.6, in a case where an attacker
  manages to generate a valid cryptographic message authentication code (HMAC-SHA1)
  - either by using a different existing vulnerability or in case the internal encryptionKey
  was exposed - it is possible to retrieve arbitrary files of a TYPO3 installation.
  This includes the possibility to fetch typo3conf/LocalConfiguration.php, which again
  contains the encryptionKey as well as credentials of the database management system
  being used. In case a database server is directly accessible either via internet
  or in a shared hosting network, this allows the ability to completely retrieve,
  manipulate or delete database contents. This includes creating an administration
  user account - which can be used to trigger remote code execution by injecting custom
  extensions. This has been patched in versions 9.5.20 and 10.4.6."
