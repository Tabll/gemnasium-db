package_slug: "packagist/typo3/cms-core"
title: "Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling"
description: "TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system released
  under the GNU GPL. In affected versions requesting invalid or non-existing resources
  via HTTP triggers the page error handler which again could retrieve content to be
  shown as an error message from another page. This leads to a scenario in which the
  application is calling itself recursively - amplifying the impact of the initial
  attack until the limits of the web server are exceeded. Users are advised to update
  to TYPO3 version 11.5.16 to resolve this issue. There are no known workarounds for
  this issue."
