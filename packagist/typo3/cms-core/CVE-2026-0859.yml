title: "TYPO3 CMS Allows Insecure Deserialization via Mailer File Spool"
description: "### Problem\nLocal platform users who can write to TYPO3’s mail‑file
  spool directory can craft a file that the system will automatically deserialize
  without any class restrictions. This flaw allows an attacker to inject and execute
  arbitrary PHP code in the public scope of the web server.\n\nThe vulnerability is
  triggered when TYPO3 is configured with `$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['MAIL']['transport_spool_type']
  = 'file';` and a scheduler task or cron job runs the command `mailer:spool:send`.
  The spool‑send operation performs the insecure deserialization that is at the core
  of this issue.\n\n### Solution\nUpdate to TYPO3 versions 10.4.55 ELTS, 11.5.49 ELTS,
  12.4.41 LTS, 13.4.23 LTS, 14.0.2 that fix the problem described.\n\n### Credits\nThanks
  to Vitaly Simonovich for reporting this issue, and to TYPO3 security team members
  Elias Häußler and Oliver Hader for fixing it.\n\n### References\n* [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2026-004](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2026-004)"
