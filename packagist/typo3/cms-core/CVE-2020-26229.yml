identifier: "CVE-2020-26229"
package_slug: "packagist/typo3/cms-core"
title: "Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference"
description: "TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system. In
  TYPO3 from, and, RSS widgets are susceptible to XML external entity processing.
  This vulnerability is reasonable, but is theoretical - it was not possible to actually
  reproduce the vulnerability with current PHP versions of supported and maintained
  system distributions. At least with libxml2 version 2.9, the processing of XML external
  entities is disabled per default - and cannot be exploited. Besides that, a valid
  backend user account is needed."
