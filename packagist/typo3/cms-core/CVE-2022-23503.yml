package_slug: "packagist/typo3/cms-core"
title: "Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')"
description: "TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system. Versions
  prior to 8.7.49, 9.5.38, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, and 12.1.1 is vulnerable to Code Injection.
  Due to the lack of separating user-submitted data from the internal configuration
  in the Form Designer backend module, it is possible to inject code instructions
  to be processed and executed via TypoScript as PHP code. The existence of individual
  TypoScript instructions for a particular form item and a valid backend user account
  with access to the form module are needed to exploit this vulnerability. This issue
  is patched in versions 8.7.49 ELTS, 9.5.38 ELTS, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, 12.1.1."
