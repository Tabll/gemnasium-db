description: "### Problem\nRestricting frontend login to specific users, organized
  in different storage folders (partitions), can be bypassed. A potential attacker
  might use this ambiguity in usernames to get access to a different account - however,
  credentials must be known to the adversary.\n\n### Solution\nUpdate to TYPO3 versions
  8.7.49 ELTS, 9.5.38 ELTS, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, 12.1.1 that fix the problem described
  above.\n\n### References\n* [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2022-013](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2022-013)\n"
