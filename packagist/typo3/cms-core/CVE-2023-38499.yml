package_slug: "packagist/typo3/cms-core"
title: "Improper Access Control"
description: "TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system. Starting
  in version 9.4.0 and prior to versions 9.5.42 ELTS, 10.4.39 ELTS, 11.5.30, and 12.4.4,
  in multi-site scenarios, enumerating the HTTP query parameters `id` and `L` allowed
  out-of-scope access to rendered content in the website frontend. For instance, this
  allowed visitors to access content of an internal site by adding handcrafted query
  parameters to the URL of a site that was publicly available. TYPO3 versions 9.5.42
  ELTS, 10.4.39 ELTS, 11.5.30, 12.4.4 fix the problem."
