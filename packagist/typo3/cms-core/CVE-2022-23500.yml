title: "Uncontrolled Recursion"
description: "TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system. In
  versions prior to 9.5.38, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, and 12.1.1, requesting invalid or non-existing
  resources via HTTP triggers the page error handler, which again could retrieve content
  to be shown as an error message from another page. This leads to a scenario in which
  the application is calling itself recursively - amplifying the impact of the initial
  attack until the limits of the web server are exceeded. This vulnerability is very
  similar, but not identical, to the one described in CVE-2021-21359. This issue is
  patched in versions 9.5.38 ELTS, 10.4.33, 11.5.20 or 12.1.1."
