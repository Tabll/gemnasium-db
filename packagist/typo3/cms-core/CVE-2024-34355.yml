title: "TYPO3 vulnerable to an HTML Injection in the History Module"
description: "### Problem\nThe history backend module is vulnerable to HTML injection.

  adversaries can still inject malicious HTML markup. Exploiting this vulnerability
  requires a valid backend user account.\n\n### Solution\nUpdate to TYPO3 version
  13.1.1 that fixes the problem described.\n\n### Credits\nThanks to TYPO3 core team
  member Andreas Kienast who reported this issue and to TYPO3 core & security team
  Benjamin Franzke who fixed the issue.\n\n### References\n* [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2024-007](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2024-007)"
