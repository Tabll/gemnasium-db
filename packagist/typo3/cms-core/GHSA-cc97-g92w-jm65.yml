title: "TYPO3 CMS Insecure Deserialization & Arbitrary Code Execution"
description: "Phar files (formerly known as \"PHP archives\") can act als self extracting
  archives which leads to the fact that source code is executed when Phar files are
  invoked. The Phar file format is not limited to be stored with a dedicated file
  extension - \"bundle.phar\" would be valid as well as \"bundle.txt\" would be. This
  way, Phar files can be obfuscated as image or text file which would not be denied
  from being uploaded and persisted to a TYPO3 installation. Due to a missing sanitization
  of user input, those Phar files can be invoked by manipulated URLs in TYPO3 backend
  forms. A valid backend user account is needed to exploit this vulnerability. In
  theory the attack vector would be possible in the TYPO3 frontend as well, however
  no functional exploit has been identified so far."
