title: "typo3 Information Disclosure Security Note"
description: "Due to reports it has been validated that internal workspaces in Neos
  are accessible without authentication. Some users assumed this is a planned feature
  but it is not. A workspace preview should be an additional feature with respective
  security measures in place.\n\nNote that this only allows reading of internal workspaces
  not writing. And for clarification, an internal workspace is a workspace that is
  non public and doesn't have an owner.\n\nGiven that an internal workspace exists
  in your installation, it is possible to view a page in context of that workspace
  by opening a link in this format:\n\nhttps://domain/path/to/page.html@workspace-name\n\nThe
  issue is quite problematic when exploited but at the same time slightly less impactful
  than it sounds. First of all there is no default internal workspace, so the issue
  affects only workspaces created by users. That also means the workspace-name, which
  will also always include a hash is individual to a project and an exploiter must
  get hold of the workspace-name including the hash. This is non trivial as there
  is no indication of the existence of it, but obviously brute force and educated
  guessed can be made."
