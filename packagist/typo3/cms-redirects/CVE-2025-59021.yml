package_slug: "packagist/typo3/cms-redirects"
title: "TYPO3 CMS Allows Broken Access Control in Redirects Module"
description: "### Problem\nBackend users with access to the redirects module and write
  permission on the `sys_redirect` table were able to  read, create, and modify any
  redirect record - without restriction to the user’s own file‑mounts or web‑mounts.
  This allowed attackers to insert or alter redirects pointing to arbitrary URLs -
  facilitating phishing or other malicious redirect attacks.\n\n### Solution\nUpdate
  to TYPO3 versions 10.4.55 ELTS, 11.5.49 ELTS, 12.4.41 LTS, 13.4.23 LTS, 14.0.2 that
  fix the problem described.\n\n### Credits\nThanks to Georg Dümmler for reporting
  this issue, and to TYPO3 security team member Elias Häußler for fixing it.\n\n###
