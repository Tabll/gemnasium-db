package_slug: "packagist/typo3/cms-form"
title: "Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type"
description: "TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system. In
  TYPO3 before versions 8.7.40, 9.5.25, 10.4.14, 11.1.1, due to the lack of ensuring
  file extensions belong to configured allowed mime-types, attackers can upload arbitrary
  data with arbitrary file extensions - however, default _fileDenyPattern_ successfully
  blocked files like _.htaccess_ or _malicious.php_. Besides that, _UploadedFileReferenceConverter_
  transforming uploaded files into proper FileReference domain model objects handles
  possible file uploads for other extensions as well - given those extensions use
  the Extbase MVC framework, make use of FileReference items in their direct or inherited
  domain model definitions and did not implement their own type converter. In case
  this scenario applies, _UploadedFileReferenceConverter_ accepts any file mime-type
  and persists files in the default location. In any way, uploaded files are placed
  in the default location _/fileadmin/user_upload/_, in most scenarios keeping the
  submitted filename - which allows attackers to directly reference files, or even
  correctly guess filenames used by other individuals, disclosing this information.
  No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. This is fixed in versions
  8.7.40, 9.5.25, 10.4.14, 11.1.1."
