title: "TYPO3 CMS Webhooks Server Side Request Forgery"
description: "### Problem\nWebhooks are inherently vulnerable to Server-Side Request
  Forgery (SSRF), which can be exploited by adversaries to target internal resources
  (e.g., _localhost_ or other services on the local network). While this is not a
  vulnerability in TYPO3 itself, it may enable attackers to blindly access systems
  that would otherwise be inaccessible. An administrator-level backend user account
  is required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n### Solution\nUpdate to TYPO3 versions
  12.4.31 LTS, 13.4.12 LTS that fix the problem described.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>\n>
  **Manual actions required**\n>\n> To mitigate potential SSRF risks via webhooks,
  it is recommended to explicitly allow access only to trusted hosts. This can be
  achieved by configuring the allowlist in `$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['HTTP']['allowed_hosts']['webhooks']`.\n>
  \n> If the allowlist is not defined or set to `null`, all requests will be allowed.\n>
  If the allowlist is an empty `array`, all requests will be blocked.\n> \n> By default,
  the factory setting allows all requests. This prevents existing webhooks from failing
  after upgrading to the affected TYPO3 versions. Administrators must configure this
  setting manually to enforce restrictions.\n\n\n### Credits\nThanks to the National
  Cyber Security Center (NCSC) of Switzerland for reporting this issue, and to TYPO3
  core & security team member Benjamin Franzke for fixing it."
