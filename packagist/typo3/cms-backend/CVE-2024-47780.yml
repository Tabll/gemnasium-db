title: "Information Disclosure in TYPO3 Page Tree"
description: "### Problem\nBackend users could see items in the backend page tree
  without having access if the mounts pointed to pages restricted for their user/group,
  or if no mounts were configured but the pages allowed access to \"everybody.\" However,
  affected users could not manipulate these pages.\n\n### Solution\nUpdate to TYPO3
  versions 10.4.46 ELTS, 11.5.40 LTS, 12.4.21 LTS, 13.3.1 that fix the problem described.\n\n###
  Credits\nThanks to Peter Schuler who reported this issue and to TYPO3 core & security
  team member Oliver Hader who fixed the issue."
