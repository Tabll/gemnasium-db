package_slug: "packagist/typo3/cms-backend"
title: "TYPO3 CMS Allows Broken Access Control in Edit Document Controller"
description: "### Problem\nBy exploiting the `defVals` parameter, attackers could
  bypass field‑level access checks during record creation in the TYPO3 backend. This
  gave them the ability to insert arbitrary data into prohibited exclude fields of
  a database table for which the user already has write permission for a reduced set
  of fields.\n\n### Solution\nUpdate to TYPO3 versions 10.4.55 ELTS, 11.5.49 ELTS,
  12.4.41 LTS, 13.4.23 LTS, 14.0.2 that fix the problem described.\n\n### Credits\nThanks
  to Daniel Windloff for reporting this issue, and to TYPO3 core & security team member
  Benjamin Franzke for fixing it.\n\n### References\n* [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2026-001](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2026-001)"
