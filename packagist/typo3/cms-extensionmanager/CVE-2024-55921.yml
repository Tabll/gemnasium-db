title: "TYPO3 Extension Manager Module vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery"
description: "### Problem\nA vulnerability has been identified in the backend user
  interface functionality involving deep links. Specifically, this functionality is
  susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Additionally, state-changing actions
  in downstream components incorrectly accepted submissions via HTTP GET and did not
  enforce the appropriate HTTP method.\n\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability
  requires the victim to have an active session on the backend user interface and
  to be deceived into interacting with a malicious URL targeting the backend, which
  can occur under the following conditions:\n\n* the user opens a malicious link,
  such as one sent via email.\n* the user visits a compromised or manipulated website
  while the following settings are misconfigured:\n  + `security.backend.enforceReferrer`
  feature is disabled,\n  + `BE/cookieSameSite` configuration is set to `lax` or `none`\n\nThe
  vulnerability in the affected downstream component “Extension Manager Module” allows
  attackers to retrieve and install 3rd party extensions from the TYPO3 Extension
  Repository - which can lead to remote code execution in the worst case.\n\n### Solution\nUpdate
  to TYPO3 versions 11.5.42 ELTS, 12.4.25 LTS, 13.4.3 LTS that fix the problem described.\n\n###
