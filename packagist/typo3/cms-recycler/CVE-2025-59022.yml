package_slug: "packagist/typo3/cms-recycler"
title: "TYPO3 CMS Allows Broken Access Control in Recycler Module"
description: "### Problem\nBackend users who had access to the recycler module could
  delete arbitrary data from any database table defined in the TCA - regardless of
  whether they had permission to that particular table. This allowed attackers to
  purge and destroy critical site data, effectively rendering the website unavailable.\n\n###
  Solution\nUpdate to TYPO3 versions 10.4.55 ELTS, 11.5.49 ELTS, 12.4.41 LTS, 13.4.23
  LTS, 14.0.2 that fix the problem described.\n\n### Credits\nThanks to Sven Jürgens
  and Daniel Windloff for reporting this issue, and to TYPO3 security team member
  Elias Häußler for fixing it.\n\n### References\n* [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2026-003](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2026-003)"
