description: "TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system released
  under the GNU GPL. In affected versions the login screen of the standalone install
  tool discloses the full path of the transient data directory (e.g. /var/www/html/var/transient/).
  This applies to composer-based scenarios only - “classic” non-composer installations
  are not affected. This issue has been addressed in version 12.4.8. Users are advised
  to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n"
