title: "Cross-Site Scripting in CKEditor4 WordCount Plugin"
description: "> ### CVSS: `.4) \n\n### Problem\nThe [WordCount](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/wordcount)
  plugin ([`npm:ckeditor-wordcount-plugin`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ckeditor-wordcount-plugin))
  for CKEditor4 is vulnerable to cross-site scripting when switching to the source
  code mode. This plugin is enabled via the `Full.yaml` configuration present, but
  is not active in the default configuration.\n\nIn default scenarios, exploiting
  this vulnerability requires a valid backend user account. However, if custom plugins
  are used on the website frontend, which accept and reflect rich-text content submitted
  by users, no authentication is required.\n\n### Solution\nUpdate to TYPO3 versions
  9.5.42 ELTS, 10.4.39 ELTS, 11.5.30 that fix the problem described above.\n\n###
  Credits\nThanks to Sybille Peters who reported this issue, and to TYPO3 core & security
  team member Oliver Hader who fixed the issue.\n\n### References\n*
