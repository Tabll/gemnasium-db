package_slug: "packagist/typo3/cms"
title: "Insufficient Session Expiration"
description: "TYPO3 is an open source web content management system. Prior to versions
  9.5.34 ELTS, 10.4.29, and 11.5.11, Admin Tool sessions initiated via the TYPO3 backend
  user interface had not been revoked even if the corresponding user account was degraded
  to lower permissions or disabled completely. This way, sessions in the admin tool
  theoretically could have been prolonged without any limit. TYPO3 versions 9.5.34
  ELTS, 10.4.29, and 11.5.11 contain a fix for the problem."
