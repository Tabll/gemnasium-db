title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language
  Statement ('Expression Language Injection')"
description: "TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system. Versions
  prior to 9.5.38, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, and 12.1.1 are subject to Sensitive Information
  Disclosure. Due to the lack of handling user-submitted YAML placeholder expressions
  in the site configuration backend module, attackers could expose sensitive internal
  information, such as system configuration or HTTP request messages of other website
  visitors. A valid backend user account having administrator privileges is needed
  to exploit this vulnerability. This issue has been patched in versions 9.5.38 ELTS,
  10.4.33, 11.5.20, 12.1.1."
