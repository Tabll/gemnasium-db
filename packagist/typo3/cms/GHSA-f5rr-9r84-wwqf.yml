title: "Typo3 Broken Access Control in Import Module"
description: "It has been discovered that the Import/Export module is susceptible
  to broken access control. Regular backend users have access to import functionality
  which usually only is available to admin users or users having User TSconfig setting
  options.impexp.enableImportForNonAdminUser explicitly enabled.\n\nDatabase content
  to be imported however was correctly checked against usersâ€™ permissions and not
  affected. However it was possible to upload files by-passing restrictions of the
  file abstraction layer (FAL) - however this did not affect executable files which
  have been correctly secured by fileDenyPattern.\n\nCurrently the only known vulnerability
  is to directly inject *.form.yaml files which could be used to trigger the vulnerability
  of TYPO3-CORE-SA-2018-003 (privilege escalation & SQL injection) - which requires
  the Form Framework (ext:form) being available on an according website. CVSSv3 scoring
  is based on this scenario.\n\nA valid backend user account is needed in order to
  exploit this vulnerability."
