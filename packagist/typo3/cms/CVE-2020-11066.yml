identifier: "CVE-2020-11066"
package_slug: "packagist/typo3/cms"
title: "Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes"
description: "Calling `unserialize()` on malicious user-submitted content can lead
  to modification of dynamically-determined object attributes and result in triggering
  deletion of an arbitrary directory in the file system, if it is writable for the
  web server. It can also trigger message submission via email using the identity
  of the website (mail relay). Another insecure deserialization vulnerability is required
  to actually exploit mentioned aspects."
