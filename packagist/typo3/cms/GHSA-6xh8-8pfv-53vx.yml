title: "Authentication Bypass in TYPO3 CMS"
description: "The default authentication service misses to invalidate empty strings
  as password. Therefore it is possible to authenticate backend and frontend users
  without password set in the database.\nNote: TYPO3 does not allow to create user
  accounts without a password. Your TYPO3 installation might only be affected if there
  is a third party component creating user accounts without password by directly manipulating
  the database."
