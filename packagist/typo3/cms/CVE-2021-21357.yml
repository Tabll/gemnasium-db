identifier: "CVE-2021-21357"
package_slug: "packagist/typo3/cms"
title: "Path Traversal"
description: "Due to improper input validation, attackers can by-pass restrictions
  of predefined options and submit arbitrary data in the Form Designer backend module
  of the Form Framework. In the default configuration of the Form Framework this allows
  attackers to explicitly allow arbitrary mime-types for file uploads - however, default
  `_fileDenyPattern_` successfully blocked files like `_.htaccess_` or `_malicious.php_`.
  Besides that, attackers can persist those files in any writable directory of the
  corresponding TYPO3 installation. A valid backend user account with access to the
  form module is needed to exploit this vulnerability."
