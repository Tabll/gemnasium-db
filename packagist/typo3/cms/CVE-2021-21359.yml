identifier: "CVE-2021-21359"
package_slug: "packagist/typo3/cms"
title: "Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)"
description: "Requesting invalid or non-existing resources via HTTP, triggers the
  page error handler which again could retrieve content to be shown as error message
  from another page. This leads to a scenario in which the application is calling
  itself recursively - amplifying the impact of the initial attack until the limits
  of the web server are exceeded."
