title: "Missing Access Check"
description: "Extbase request handling fails to implement a proper access check for
  requested controller/ action combinations, which makes it possible for an attacker
  to execute arbitrary Extbase actions by crafting a special request. To successfully
  exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have access to at least one Extbase
  plugin or module action in a TYPO3 installation. The missing access check inevitably
  leads to information disclosure or remote code execution, depending on the action
  that an attacker is able to execute."
