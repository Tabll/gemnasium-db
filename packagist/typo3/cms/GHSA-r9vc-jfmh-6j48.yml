title: "TYPO3 frontend login vulnerable to Session Fixation"
description: "It has been discovered that TYPO3 is susceptible to session fixation.
  If a user authenticates while anonymous session data is present, the session id
  is not changed. This makes it possible for attackers to generate a valid session
  id, trick users into using this session id (e.g. by leveraging a different Cross-Site
  Scripting vulnerability) and then maybe getting access to an authenticated session."
