- "CVE-2020-15098"
- "GHSA-m5vr-3m74-jwxp"
package_slug: "packagist/typo3/cms"
title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "In TYPO3 CMS, it has been discovered that an internal verification mechanism
  can be used to generate arbitrary checksums. This allows to inject arbitrary data
  having a valid cryptographic message authentication code (HMAC-SHA1) and can lead
  to various attack chains including potential privilege escalation, insecure deserialization
  & remote code execution. The overall severity of this vulnerability is high based
  on mentioned attack chains and the requirement of having a valid backend user session
  (authenticated)."
