title: "TYPO3 Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability Exploitable by Editors"
description: "It has been discovered that link tags generated by typolink functionality
  in the website's frontend are vulnerable to cross-site scripting - values being
  assigned to HTML attributes have not been parsed correctly. A valid backend user
  account is needed to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nAs second and separate vulnerability
  in the filelist module of the backend user interface has been referenced with this
  advisory as well. Error messages being shown after using a malicious name for renaming
  a file are not propery encoded, thus vulnerable to cross-site scripting. A valid
  backend user account is needed to exploit this vulnerability."
