package_slug: "packagist/typo3/cms"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "The typo3/html-sanitizer package is an HTML sanitizer, written in PHP,
  aiming to provide XSS-safe markup based on explicitly allowed tags, attributes and
  values. Due to a parsing issue in the upstream package `masterminds/html5`, malicious
  markup used in a sequence with special HTML comments cannot be filtered and sanitized.
  This allows for a bypass of the cross-site scripting mechanism of `typo3/html-sanitizer`.
  This issue has been addressed in versions 1.0.7 and 2.0.16 of the `typo3/html-sanitizer`
  package. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue."
