title: "Observable Discrepancy"
description: "TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system released
  under the GNU GPL. It has been discovered that observing response time during user
  authentication (backend and frontend) can be used to distinguish between existing
  and non-existing user accounts. Extension authors of 3rd party TYPO3 extensions
  providing a custom authentication service should check if the extension is affected
  by the described problem. Affected extensions must implement new `MimicServiceInterface::mimicAuthUser`,
  which simulates corresponding times regular processing would usually take. Update
  to TYPO3 version 7.6.58 ELTS, 8.7.48 ELTS, 9.5.37 ELTS, 10.4.32 or 11.5.16 that
  fix this problem. There are no known workarounds for this issue."
