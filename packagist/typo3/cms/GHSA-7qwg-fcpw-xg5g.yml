title: "Privilege Escalation & SQL Injection in TYPO3 CMS"
description: "Failing to properly dissociate system related configuration from user
  generated configuration, the Form Framework (system extension \"form\") is vulnerable
  to SQL injection and Privilege Escalation. Basically instructions can be persisted
  to a form definition file that were not configured to be modified - this applies
  to definitions managed using the form editor module as well as direct file upload
  using the regular file list module. A valid backend user account as well as having
  system extension form activated are needed in order to exploit this vulnerability."
