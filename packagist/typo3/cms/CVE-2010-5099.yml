title: "TYPO3 Path Traversal vulnerability"
description: "The fileDenyPattern functionality in the PHP file inclusion protection
  API in TYPO3 4.2.x before 4.2.16, 4.3.x before 4.3.9, and 4.4.x before 4.4.5 does
  not properly filter file types, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended
  access restrictions and access arbitrary PHP files, as demonstrated using path traversal
  sequences with %00 null bytes and CVE-2010-3714 to read the TYPO3 encryption key
  from localconf.php."
