description: "Due to a missing signature (HMAC) for a request argument, an attacker
  could unserialize arbitrary objects within FLOW3.\n\nTo our knowledge it is neither
  possible to inject code through this vulnerability, nor are there exploitable objects
  within the FLOW3 Base Distribution. However, there might be exploitable objects
  within user applications."
