package_slug: "packagist/getformwork/formwork"
title: "Formwork Improperly Managed Privileges in User creation"
description: "The application fails to properly enforce role-based authorization during
  account creation. Although the system validates that the specified role exists,
  it does not verify whether the current user has sufficient privileges to assign
  highly privileged roles such as admin. As a result, an authenticated user with the
  editor role can create a new account with administrative privileges, leading to
  full administrative access and complete compromise of the CMS."
