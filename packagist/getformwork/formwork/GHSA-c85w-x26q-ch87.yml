title: "Formwork improperly validates input of User role preventing site and panel
  availability"
description: "Improper validation of select fields allows attackers to craft an input
  that crashes the system, resulting in a 500 status and making the entire site and
  administration panel unavailable.\nThis clearly impacts the Availability aspect
  of the CIA triad (confidentiality, integrity, and availability), although the attack
  still has certain limitations."
