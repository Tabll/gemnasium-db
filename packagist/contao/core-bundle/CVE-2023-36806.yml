package_slug: "packagist/contao/core-bundle"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "Contao is an open source content management system. Starting in version
  4.0.0 and prior to versions 4.9.42, 4.13.28, and 5.1.10, it is possible for untrusted
  backend users to inject malicious code into headline fields in the back end, which
  will be executed both in the element preview (back end) and on the website (front
  end). Installations are only affected if there are untrusted back end users who
  have the rights to modify headline fields, or other fields using the input unit
  widget. Contao 4.9.42, 4.13.28, and 5.1.10 have a patch for this issue. As a workaround,
  disable the login for all untrusted back end users."
