description: "Contao is an open source CMS that allows creation of websites and scalable
  web applications. In affected versions it is possible to gain privileged rights
  in the Contao back end. Installations are only affected if they have untrusted back
  end users who have access to the form generator. All users are advised to update
  to Contao 4.4.56, 4.9.18 or 4.11.7. As a workaround users may disable the form generator
  or disable the login for untrusted back end users."
