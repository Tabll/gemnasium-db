title: "contao/core Insufficient input validation allows for code injection and remote
  execution"
description: "contao/core versions 2.x prior to 2.11.17 and 3.x prior to 3.2.9 are
  vulnerable to arbitrary code execution on the server due to insufficient input validation.
  In fact, attackers can remove or change pathconfig.php by entering a URL, meaning
  that the entire Contao installation will no longer be accessible or malicious code
  can be executed."
