package_slug: "packagist/bref/bref"
title: "Interpretation Conflict"
description: "Bref enable serverless PHP on AWS Lambda. When Bref is used with the
  Event-Driven Function runtime and the handler is a `RequestHandlerInterface`, then
  the Lambda event is converted to a PSR7 object. During the conversion process, if
  the request is a MultiPart, each part is parsed and its content added in the `$files`
  or `$parsedBody` arrays. The conversion process produces a different output compared
  to the one of plain PHP when keys ending with and open square bracket ([) are used.
  Based on the application logic the difference in the body parsing might lead to
  vulnerabilities and/or undefined behaviors. This vulnerability is patched in 2.1.13."
