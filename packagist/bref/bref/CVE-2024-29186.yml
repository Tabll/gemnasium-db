title: "Slow String Operations via MultiPart Requests in Event-Driven Functions"
description: "When Bref is used with the Event-Driven Function runtime and the handler
  is a `RequestHandlerInterface`, then the Lambda event is converted to a PSR7 object.\nDuring
  the conversion process, if the request is a MultiPart, each part is parsed. In the
  parsing process, the `Content-Type` header of each part is read using the [`Riverline/multipart-parser`](https://github.com/Riverline/multipart-parser/)
  library.\n\nThe library, in the `StreamedPart::parseHeaderContent` function, performs
  slow multi-byte string operations on the header value.\nPrecisely, the [`mb_convert_encoding`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mb-convert-encoding.php)
  function is used with the first (`$string`) and third (`$from_encoding`) parameters
  read from the header value."
