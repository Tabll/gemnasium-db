package_slug: "packagist/akaunting/akaunting"
title: "Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password"
description: "Akaunting version 2.1.12 and earlier suffers from a password reset spoofing
  vulnerability, wherein an attacker can proxy password reset requests through a running
  Akaunting instance, if that attacker knows the target's e-mail address. This issue
  was fixed in version 2.1.13 of the product. Please note that this issue is ultimately
  caused by the defaults provided by the Laravel framework, specifically how proxy
  headers are handled with respect to multi-tenant implementations. In other words,
  while this is not technically a vulnerability in Laravel, this default configuration
  is very likely to lead to practically identical identical vulnerabilities in Laravel
  projects that implement multi-tenant applications."
