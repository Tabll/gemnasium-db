title: "YesWiki Stored XSS Vulnerability in Comments "
description: "A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in
  the applicationâ€™s comments feature. This issue allows a malicious actor to inject
  JavaScript payloads that are stored and later executed in the browser of any user
  viewing the affected comment.\n\nThe XSS occurs because the application fails to
  properly sanitize or encode user input submitted to the comments. Notably, the application
  sanitizes or does not allow execution of `<script>` tags, but does not account for
  payloads obfuscated using JavaScript block comments like `/* JavaScriptPayload */`."
