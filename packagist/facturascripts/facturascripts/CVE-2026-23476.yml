title: "FacturaScripts is Vulnerable to Reflected XSS"
description: "A reflected XSS bug has been found in FacturaScripts. The problem is
  in how error messages get displayed - it's using Twig's `| raw` filter which skips
  HTML escaping. When a database error is triggered (like passing a string where an
  integer is expected), the error message includes all input and gets rendered without
  sanitization.\n\nAttackers can use this to phish credentials from other users since
  HttpOnly is set on cookies (so stealing cookies directly won't work, but attackers
  can inject a fake login form).\n\n**CVSS 6.1 (Medium-High)**\n\n---"
