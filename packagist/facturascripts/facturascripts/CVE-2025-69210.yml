title: "FacturaScripts is Vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via XML
  File Upload"
description: "A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the product
  file upload functionality.\n\nAuthenticated users can upload crafted XML files containing
  executable JavaScript. These files are later rendered by the application without
  sufficient sanitization or content-type enforcement, allowing arbitrary JavaScript
  execution when the file is accessed.\n\nBecause product files uploaded by regular
  users are visible to administrative users, this vulnerability can be leveraged to
  execute malicious JavaScript in an administrator’s browser session."
