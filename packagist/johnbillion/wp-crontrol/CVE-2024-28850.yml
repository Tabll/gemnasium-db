title: "WP Crontrol vulnerable to possible RCE when combined with a pre-condition"
description: "WP Crontrol includes a feature that allows administrative users to create
  events in the WP-Cron system that store and execute PHP code [subject to the restrictive
  security permissions documented here](https://wp-crontrol.com/docs/php-cron-events/).
  While there is _no known vulnerability in this feature on its own_, there exists
  potential for this feature to be vulnerable to RCE if it were specifically targeted
  via vulnerability chaining that exploited a separate SQLi (or similar) vulnerability.\n\nThis
  is exploitable on a site if one of the below preconditions are met:\n\n* The site
  is vulnerable to a writeable SQLi vulnerability in any plugin, theme, or WordPress
  core\n* The site's database is compromised at the hosting level\n* The site is vulnerable
  to a method of updating arbitrary options in the `wp_options` table\n* The site
  is vulnerable to a method of triggering an arbitrary action, filter, or function
  with control of the parameters"
