title: "WP Crontrol Authenticated (Administrator+) plugin vulnerable to Blind Server-Side
  Request Forgery"
description: "The WP Crontrol plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Blind Server-Side
  Request Forgery in versions 1.17.0 to 1.19.1 via the `wp_remote_request()` function.
  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access
  and above, to make web requests to arbitrary locations originating from the web
  application and can be used to query and modify information from internal services.\n\nIt
  is not possible for a user without Administrator level access to exploit this weakness.
  It is not possible for an Administrator performing an attack to see the HTTP response
  to the request to their chosen URL, nor is it possible for them to time the response."
