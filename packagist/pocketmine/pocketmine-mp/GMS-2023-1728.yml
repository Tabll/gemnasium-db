title: "PocketMine MP vulnerable to uncontrolled resource consumption via mismatched
  type of 'InventoryTransactionPacket'"
description: "### Impact\nA \"mismatch\" type `InventoryTransactionPacket` is sent
  by the client to request a resync of all currently open inventories.\n\nSince PocketMine-MP
  does not rate-limit these \"mismatch\" transactions, and the syncing of inventories
  is not deferred until, e.g. the end of the current tick, they can be used as a very
  cheap bandwidth multiplier by making the server send out many MB of data (network
  serialized inventory items can be very large, especially when dealing with large
  amounts of NBT).\n\nThis is not currently known to have been exploited in the wild.\n\n###
  Patches\nThis problem was fixed in 4.18.0-ALPHA2 by ca6d51498f12427a947467da8fcad7811418e6cc
  alongside the introduction of the `ItemStackRequest` system implementation.\n\n###
  Workarounds\nPlugins can handle `DataPacketReceiveEvent` for `InventoryTransactionPacket`
  and check if the type is `MismatchTransactionData`. If it is, apply some kind of
  rate limit (e.g. max 1 per tick)."
