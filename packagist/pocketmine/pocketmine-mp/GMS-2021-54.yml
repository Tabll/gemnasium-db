description: "### Impact\nOriginally reported in iTXTech/Genisys#1188\n\n```txt\nPotterHarry98\npotterharry98\n```\n\n`deop
  PotterHarry98`\n\nwill remove `potterharry98` from the ops.txt but not `PotterHarry98`.\n\nOperator
  permissions are checked using `Config->exists()` with `lowercase=true`, which will
  result in a match:\nhttps://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/blob/22bb1ce8e03dba57173debf0415390511d68e045/src/utils/Config.php#L449\n\nThis
  means that it's possible to make yourself impossible to de-op (using commands) by
  adding your name to ops.txt with uppercase letters.\n\n### Patches\n4d37b79ff7f9d9452e988387f97919a9a1c4954e\n\n###
  Workarounds\nThis can be easily addressed by removing the offending lines from ops.txt
  manually.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about
