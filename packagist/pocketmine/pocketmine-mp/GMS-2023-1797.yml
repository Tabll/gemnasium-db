title: "PocketMine-MP vulnerable to improperly checked dropped item count leading
  to server crash"
description: "### Impact\nIn 4.18.0, the network handling of inventories was completely
  revamped. Due to this, a bug was introduced which allowed players to request that
  the server drop more of an item than they had available in their hotbar.\n\nThis
  does not lead to any duplication issues, but instead led to a server crash, and
  is believed to have been exploited in the wild.\n\n### Patches\nThis was fixed in
  58974765a68f63a9968a7ff3a06f584ff2ee08d2, which was released in 4.18.1.\n\n### Workarounds\nHandle
  `InventoryTransactionPacket` in `DataPacketReceiveEvent`, and verify that the item
  count dropped isn't more than the available item count. However, it's complicated
  to do this, so it's not recommended."
