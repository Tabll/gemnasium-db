title: "PocketMine-MP server crash with certain invalid JSON payloads in `LoginPacket`
  due to dependency vulnerability (again)"
description: "An attacker could crash PocketMine-MP by sending malformed JSON in `LoginPacket`.\n\nThis
  happened due to the particular handling of NULL types in the json mapper which accepts
  NULL type values in typed arrays which PocketMine-MP did not expect.\n\nCode processing
  arrays in the JSON data could then crash due to unexpected `NULL` elements."
