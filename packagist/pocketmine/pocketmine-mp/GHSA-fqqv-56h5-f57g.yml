title: "PocketMine-MP `ResourcePackDataInfoPacket` amplification vulnerability due
  to lack of resource pack sequence status checking"
description: "A denial-of-service / out-of-memory vulnerability exists in the `STATUS_SEND_PACKS`
  handling of `ResourcePackClientResponsePacket`.\nPocketMine-MP processes the `packIds`
  array without verifying that all entries are unique.\nA malicious (non-standard)
  Bedrock client can send multiple duplicate valid pack UUIDs in the same `STATUS_SEND_PACKS`
  packet, causing the server to send the same pack multiple times. This can quickly
  exhaust memory and crash the server.\nSeverity: **High** â€” Remote DoS from an authenticated
  client.\n\n---"
