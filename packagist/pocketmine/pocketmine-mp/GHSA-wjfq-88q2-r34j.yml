title: "Unhandled exception when decoding form response JSON"
description: "When handling form responses from the client (`ModalFormResponsePacket`),
  the Minecraft Windows client may send weird JSON that `json_decode()` can't understand.
  A workaround for this is implemented in `InGamePacketHandler::stupid_json_decode()`.\n\nAn
  `InvalidArgumentException` is thrown by this function when it fails to fix an error
  found in the JSON, which is not caught by the caller. This leads to a server crash."
