title: "Improperly checked metadata on tools/armour itemstacks received from the client"
description: "Due to a workaround applied in 1.13, an attacker may send a negative
  damage/meta value in a tool or armour item's NBT, which `TypeConverter` then blindly
  uses as if it was valid without being checked.\n\nWhen this invalid metadata value
  reaches `Durable->setDamage()`, an exception is thrown because the metadata is not
  within the expected range for damage values.\n\nThis can be reproduced with either
  a too-large damage value, or a negative one."
