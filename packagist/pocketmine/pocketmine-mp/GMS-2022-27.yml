title: "Unchecked validity of Facing values in PlayerActionPacket"
description: "### Impact\nA remote attacker may crash a server by sending `PlayerActionPacket`
  with invalid facing values (e.g. negative), specifically with `START_BREAK` or `CRACK_BLOCK`
  actions, or with a `UseItemTransactionData` (typically in `InventoryTransactionPacket`).\n\n###
  Patches\nf126479c37ff00a717a828f5271cf8e821d12d6c\n\n### Workarounds\nUsing a plugin,
  cancel `DataPacketReceiveEvent` if the packet is `PlayerActionPacket` and the facing
  is outside the range 0-5 when receiving START_BREAK or CRACK_BLOCK actions, or UseItemTransactionData.
  However, beware that negative values may be legitimate in some cases.\n\n### For
  more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n*
