title: "Improperly checked IDs on itemstacks received from the client leading to server
  crash in PocketMine-MP"
description: "Due to a workaround for unmapped network items implemented in 4.0.0-BETA5
  (8ac16345a3bc099b62c1f5cfbf3b736e621c3f76), arbitrary item IDs are able to be written
  into an item's NBT. The intended purpose of this is to make said unmapped network
  items able to be moved around the inventory without issues.\n\nThis led to an exploit
  due to internal limits on the range that item IDs can occupy (-32768 - 32767), while
  the tag type used to represent the replacement IDs for unknown items is a `TAG_Int`,
  allowing a range from -(2^31) - 2^31 - 1. This leads to an uncaught exception which
  crashes the server."
