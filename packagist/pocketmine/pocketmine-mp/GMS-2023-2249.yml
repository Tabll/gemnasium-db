title: "PocketMine-MP server crash with certain invalid JSON payloads in `LoginPacket`
  due to dependency vulnerability (again)"
description: "### Impact\nAn attacker could crash the server by sending malformed
  JWT JSON in `LoginPacket` due to a security vulnerability in [`netresearch/jsonmapper`](https://github.com/cweiske/JsonMapper),
  due to accepting `NULL` values in arrays whose types do not expect `NULL`.\n\n###
  Patches\nThis problem was fixed in 5.3.1 and 4.23.1 by updating JsonMapper to include
  the following commit: pmmp/netresearch-jsonmapper@4f90e8dab1c9df331fad7d3d89823404e882668c\n\n###
  Workarounds\nA plugin may handle `DataPacketReceiveEvent` for `LoginPacket` and
  check that none of the input arrays contain `NULL` where it's not expected, but
  this is rather cumbersome."
