title: "PocketMine-MP has improperly handled dye colour IDs in banner NBT, leading
  to server crash"
description: "### Impact\n`DyeColorIdMap->fromId()` does not account for the possibility
  that it might be given invalid input. This means that an undefined offset error
  would occur whenever this happened.
  
  This code is indirectly called during 
  [`Banner->deserializeCompoundTag()`](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/blob/38d6284671e8b657ba557e765a6c29b24a7705f5/src/item/Banner.php#L104),
  which is invoked when deserializing any item NBT, whether from network or disk.\n\nAn
  attacker could use this bug to crash a server by providing NBT with invalid values
  for pattern colours in an inventory transaction, or by using `/give` to obtain an
  item with NBT like this.\n\n### Patches\n08b9495bce2d65a6d1d3eeb76e484499a00765eb\n\n###
  Workarounds\nThis is quite difficult to work around via a plugin. Theoretically,
  it's possible to override the `Banner` item class from a plugin and validate the
  data before it reaches `deserializeCompoundTag()`.\n\n### For more information\nIf
