title: "PocketMine-MP allows malicious client data to waste server resources due to
  lack of limits for explode()"
description: "Due to lack of limits by default in the [`explode()`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.explode.php)
  function, malicious clients were able to abuse some packets to waste server CPU
  and memory.\n\nThis is similar to a previous security issue published in https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/security/advisories/GHSA-gj94-v4p9-w672,
  but with a wider impact, including but not limited to:\n\n- Sign editing\n- LoginPacket
  JWT parsing\n- Command parsing\n\nHowever, the estimated impact of these issues
  is low, due to other limits such as the packet decompression limit."
