title: "Uncapped length of skin data fields submitted by players"
description: "### Impact\nSome skin data fields (e.g. skinID, geometryName) are not
  capped in length. These fields are typically saved in the NBT data of a player when
  the player quits the server, or during an autosave.\n\nThis is problematic due to
  the 32767 byte limit on `TAG_String`s. If any of these fields exceeds 32767 bytes,
  an exception will be thrown during data saving, which will cause the server to crash.\n\nOther
  fields (such as skinGeometryData) are also uncapped, but those have a much larger
  2 GB length limit, so this is not a concern for those, particularly considering
  the decompressed packet size limit of 2 MB.\n\n### Patches\nPM3: 958a9dbf0fe3131ab60319c5a939f5dfbfe5dfbb\nPM4:
  6492cac5c10f9fa8443ceddd2191a7b65b73f601\n\n### Workarounds\nA plugin may check
  player skins during `PlayerLoginEvent` and `PlayerSkinChangeEvent` and ensure that
  the offending fields are not larger than 32767 bytes.\n\n### For more information\nIf
