title: "Book page text, count, and author/title length is not limited in PocketMine-MP"
description: "### Impact\nPlayers can fill book pages with as many characters as they
  like; the server does not check this.\nIn addition, the maximum of 50 pages is also
  not enforced, meaning that players can create \"book bombs\".\n\nThis causes a variety
  of problems:\n- Oversized NBT on the wire costing excess bandwidth for server and
  client\n- Server crashes when saving region-based worlds due to exceeding maximum
  chunk size of 1 MB (PM3-specific)\n- Server crashes if any book page exceeds 32
  KiB (due to TAG_String size limit) (PM4-specific)\n\nThis does, however, require
  that an attacker obtain a writable book in the first place in order to exploit the
  problem.\n\n### Patches\nThe bug has been fixed in 3.26.5 and 4.0.5.\n\n### Workarounds\nBan
  writable books, or use a plugin to cancel `PlayerEditBookEvent` to cancel the event
  if `strlen(text) > 1024 || mb_strlen(text) > 256`.\n\n### For more information\nIf
  you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [team@pmmp.io](mailto:team@pmmp.io)\n"
