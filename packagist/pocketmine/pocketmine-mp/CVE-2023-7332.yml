package_slug: "packagist/pocketmine/pocketmine-mp"
title: "PocketMine-MP vulnerable to improperly checked dropped item count leading
  to server crash"
description: "In 4.18.0, the network handling of inventories was completely revamped.
  Due to this, a bug was introduced which allowed players to request that the server
  drop more of an item than they had available in their hotbar.\n\nThis did not lead
  to any duplication issues, but instead led to a server crash, and is believed to
  have been exploited in the wild."
