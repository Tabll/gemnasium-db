title: "PocketMine-MP vulnerable to server crash with certain invalid JSON payloads
  in `LoginPacket` due to vulnerable dependency"
description: "### Impact\nAn attacker could crash the server by sending malformed
  JWT JSON in `LoginPacket` due to a security vulnerability in [`netresearch/jsonmapper`](https://github.com/cweiske/JsonMapper),
  due to improper checking for mapping JSON arrays and objects onto scalar model properties
  such as strings.\n\n### Patches\nThe problem was fixed in a fork of JsonMapper in
  dktapps/JsonMapper@a31902a31f5b6fdb832f57c0e3a3f16a3b41c012. PocketMine-MP releases
  4.20.5 and 4.21.1 have been released with the fix.\n\n### Workarounds\n- Users of
  PocketMine-MP source installations may manually install the patched version of JsonMapper
  by backporting commit pmmp/PocketMine-MP@09668a37d66c6023685a948b7550c918620e98f2.\n-
  A plugin may also be able to workaround this issue by using `DataPacketReceiveEvent`
  to attempt detection of suspicious payloads. An `ErrorException` will be thrown
  in the crash case, which can be caught by plugins.\n\n### References\ncweiske/jsonmapper#210\n"
