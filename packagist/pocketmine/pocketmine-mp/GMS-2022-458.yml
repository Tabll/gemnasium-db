title: "Improperly checked metadata on tools/armour itemstacks received from the client"
description: "Due to a workaround applied in 1.13, an attacker may send
  a negative damage/meta value in a tool or armour item's NBT, which `TypeConverter`
  then blindly uses as if it was valid without being checked.\n\nWhen this invalid
  metadata value reaches `Durable->setDamage()`, an exception is thrown because the
  metadata is not within the expected range for damage values."
