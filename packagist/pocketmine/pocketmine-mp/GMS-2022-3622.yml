title: "PocketMine-MP invalid skin geometry JSON data leading to server crash"
description: "### Impact\n`pocketmine\\entity\\Skin` does not correctly handle errors
  produced by `adhocore/json-comment`, which throws `RuntimeException` rather than
  returning `false` as PocketMine-MP expects.\n\nThis leads to a server crash if the
  skin geometry data is invalid for some reason (e.g. a syntax error).\n\n### Patches\nc9626c610b8f6810c8c987559c9197b2a291f0bb\n\n###
  Workarounds\nA plugin could handle `LoginPacket` and `PlayerSkinPacket` to verify
  the skin geometry data can be parsed correctly, so that the error condition in the
  core code is never reached.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions
  or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [security@pmmp.io](mailto:security@example.com)\n"
