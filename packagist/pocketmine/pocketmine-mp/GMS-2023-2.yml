title: "PocketMine-MP vulnerable to denial-of-service by sending large modal form
  responses"
description: "### Impact\nDue to a workaround for an old client bug (which has since
  been fixed), very large JSON payloads in `ModalFormResponsePacket` were able to
  cause the server to spend a significant amount of time processing the packet. Large
  numbers of these packets were able to hog CPU time so as to prevent the server from
  processing other connections in a timely manner.\n\n### Patches\nThe problem has
  been addressed in 3baa5ab71214f96e6e7ab12cb9beef08118473b5 by removing the workaround
  code.\n\n### Workarounds\nPlugins could cancel `DataPacketReceiveEvent` for this
  packet, decode the data their way, and then call `Player->onFormSubmit()` directly,
  bypassing the vulnerable code."
