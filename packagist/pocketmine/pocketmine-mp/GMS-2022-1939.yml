title: "Improperly checked IDs on itemstacks received from the client leading to server
  crash in PocketMine-MP"
description: "### Impact\nDue to a workaround for unmapped network items implemented
  in 4.0.0-BETA5 (8ac16345a3bc099b62c1f5cfbf3b736e621c3f76), arbitrary item IDs are
  able to be written into an item's NBT. The intended purpose of this is to make said
  unmapped network items able to be moved around the inventory without issues.\n\nThis
  led to an exploit due to internal limits on the range that item IDs can occupy (-32768
  - 32767), while the tag type used to represent the replacement IDs for unknown items
  is a `TAG_Int`, allowing a range from -(2^31) - 2^31 - 1. This leads to an uncaught
  exception which crashes the server.\n\n### Patches\n5fd685e07d61ef670584ed11a52fd5f4b99a81a7\n\n###
  Workarounds\nIn theory this can be checked by plugins using a custom `TypeConverter`,
  but this is likely to be very cumbersome.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have
  any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [team@pmmp.io](mailto:team@pmmp.io)\n"
