title: "Incorrect Authorization"
description: "sf_event_mgt is an event management and registration extension for the
  TYPO3 CMS based on ExtBase and Fluid. In affected versions the existing access control
  check for events in the backend module got broken during the update of the extension
  to TYPO3 12.4, because the `RedirectResponse` from the `$this->redirect()` function
  was never handled. This issue has been addressed in version 7.4.0. Users are advised
  to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
