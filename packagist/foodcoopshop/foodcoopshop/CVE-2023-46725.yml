title: "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
description: "FoodCoopShop is open source software for food coops and local shops.
  Versions prior to 3.6.1 is vulnerable to server-side request forgery. In the Network
  module, a manufacturer account can use the `/api/updateProducts.json` endpoint to
  make the server send a request to an arbitrary host. This means that the server
  can be used as a proxy into the internal network where the server is. Furthermore,
  the checks on a valid image are not adequate, leading to a time of check time of
  use issue. For example, by using a custom server that returns 200 on HEAD requests,
  then return a valid image on first GET request and then a 302 redirect to final
  target on second GET request, the server will copy whatever file is at the redirect
  destination, making this a full SSRF. Version 3.6.1 fixes this vulnerability."
