package_slug: "packagist/statamic/cms"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "Statamic is a Laravel and Git powered CMS. HTML files crafted to look
  like jpg files are able to be uploaded, allowing for XSS. This affects the front-end
  forms with asset fields without any mime type validation, asset fields in the control
  panel, and asset browser in the control panel. Additionally, if the XSS is crafted
  in a specific way, the \"copy password reset link\" feature may be exploited to
  gain access to a user's password reset token and gain access to their account. The
  authorized user is required to execute the XSS in order for the vulnerability to
  occur. In versions 4.46.0 and 3.4.17, the XSS vulnerability has been patched, and
  the copy password reset link functionality has been disabled. "
