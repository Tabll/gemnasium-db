title: "Flarum's logout Route allows open redirects"
description: "The Flarum `/logout` route includes a redirect parameter that allows
  any third party to redirect users from a (trusted) domain of the Flarum installation
  to redirect to any link. Sample: `example.com/logout?return=https://google.com`.
  For logged-in users, the logout must be confirmed. Guests are immediately redirected.
  This could be used by spammers to redirect to a web address using a trusted domain
  of a running Flarum installation.\n\nSome ecosystem extensions modifying the logout
  route have already been affected. Sample: https://discuss.flarum.org/d/22229-premium-wordpress-integration/526"
