title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "flarum is a forum software package for building communities. In versions
  prior to 1.7.0 an admin account which has already been compromised by an attacker
  may use a vulnerability in the `LESS` parser which can be exploited to read sensitive
  files on the server through the use of path traversal techniques. An attacker can
  achieve this by providing an absolute path to a sensitive file in the custom `LESS`
  setting, which the `LESS` parser will then read. For example, an attacker could
  use the following code to read the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file on a linux
  machine. The scope of what files is vulnerable will depend on the permissions given
  to the running flarum process. The vulnerability has been addressed in version `1.7`.
  Users should upgrade to this version to mitigate the vulnerability. Users unable
  to upgrade may mitigate the vulnerability by ensuring that their admin accounts
  are secured with strong passwords and follow other best practices for account security.
  Additionally, users can limit the exposure of sensitive files on the server by implementing
  appropriate file permissions and access controls at the operating system level."
