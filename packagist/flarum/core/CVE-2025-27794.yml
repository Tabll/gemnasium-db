title: "Flarum Vulnerable to Session Hijacking via Authoritative Subdomain Cookie
  Overwrite"
description: "A session hijacking vulnerability exists when an attacker-controlled
  **authoritative subdomain** under a parent domain (e.g., `subdomain.host.com`) sets
  cookies scoped to the parent domain (`.host.com`). This allows session token replacement
  for applications hosted on sibling subdomains (e.g., `community.host.com`) if session
  tokens aren't rotated post-authentication.\n\n**Key Constraints**:\n- Attacker must
  control **any subdomain** under the parent domain (e.g., `evil.host.com` or `x.y.host.com`).\n-
  Parent domain must **not** be on the [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/).\n\nDue
  to non-existent session token rotation after authenticating we can theoretically
  reproduce the vulnerability by using browser dev tools, but due to the browser's
  security measures this does not seem to be exploitable as described.\n\n---"
