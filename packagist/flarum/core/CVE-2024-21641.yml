package_slug: "packagist/flarum/core"
title: "URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')"
description: "Flarum is open source discussion platform software. Prior to version
  1.8.5, the Flarum `/logout` route includes a redirect parameter that allows any
  third party to redirect users from a (trusted) domain of the Flarum installation
  to redirect to any link. For logged-in users, the logout must be confirmed. Guests
  are immediately redirected. This could be used by spammers to redirect to a web
  address using a trusted domain of a running Flarum installation. The vulnerability
  has been fixed and published as flarum/core v1.8.5. As a workaround, some extensions
  modifying the logout route can remedy this issue if their implementation is safe."
