title: "Kirby CMS vulnerable to user enumeration in the brute force protection"
description: "Kirby comes with a built-in brute force protection. By default, 
  it will prevent further login attempts after 10 failed logins from a single IP 
  address or of a single existing user. After every failed login attempt, Kirby 
  inserts a random delay between one millisecond and two seconds to make automated 
  attacks harder and to avoid leaking whether the user exists. Unfortunately, this 
  random delay was not inserted after the brute force limit was reached.
  
  Because Kirby only tracks failed login attempts per email address for existing users 
  but always tracks failed login attempts per IP address, this behavior could be abused 
  by attackers for user enumeration. For this to work, an attacker would need to create
  login requests beyond the trials limit (which is 10 by default) from two or more IP 
  addresses. After the trials limit was reached, the login form immediately blocked 
  further requests for existing users, but not for invalid users.

  This exploit does not scale to brute force attacks because of the delay during the 
  first 10 requests per user, the faint difference between the responses for valid and 
  invalid users and the fact that code-based logins would send an email for every login 
  attempt, which makes the attack easy to spot. The vulnerability is therefore only 
  relevant for targeted attacks."
