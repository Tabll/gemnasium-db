title: "Improper Restriction of Recursive Entity References in DTDs ('XML Entity Expansion')"
description: "Kirby is a content management system. A vulnerability in versions prior
  to 3.5.8.3, 3.6.6.3, 3.7.5.2, 3.8.4.1, and 3.9.6 only affects Kirby sites that use
  the `Xml` data handler (e.g. `Data::decode($string, 'xml')`) or the `Xml::parse()`
  method in site or plugin code. The Kirby core does not use any of the affected methods.\n\nXML
  External Entities (XXE) is a little used feature in the XML markup language that
  allows to include data from external files in an XML structure. If the name of the
  external file can be controlled by an attacker, this becomes a vulnerability that
  can be abused for various system impacts like the disclosure of internal or confidential
  data that is stored on the server (arbitrary file disclosure) or to perform network
  requests on behalf of the server (server-side request forgery, SSRF).\n\nKirby's
  `Xml::parse()` method used PHP's `LIBXML_NOENT` constant, which enabled the processing
  of XML external entities during the parsing operation. The `Xml::parse()` method
  is used in the `Xml` data handler (e.g. `Data::decode($string, 'xml')`). Both the
  vulnerable method and the data handler are not used in the Kirby core. However they
  may be used in site or plugin code, e.g. to parse RSS feeds or other XML files.
  If those files are of an external origin (e.g. uploaded by a user or retrieved from
  an external URL), attackers may be able to include an external entity in the XML
  file that will then be processed in the parsing process. Kirby sites that don't
  use XML parsing in site or plugin code are *not* affected.\n\nThe problem has been
  patched in Kirby 3.5.8.3, 3.6.6.3, 3.7.5.2, 3.8.4.1, and 3.9.6. In all of the mentioned
  releases, the maintainers have removed the `LIBXML_NOENT` constant as processing
  of external entities is out of scope of the parsing logic. This protects all uses
  of the method against the described vulnerability."
