title: "Cross-site scripting from content entered in the tags and multiselect fields"
description: "The tags and multiselect fields allow to select tags from an autocompleted
  list. The tags field also allows to enter new tags or edit existing tags. Kirby
  already handled escaping of the autocompleted tags, but unfortunately the Panel
  used HTML rendering for new or edited tags as well as for custom tags from the content
  file.\n\nThis allowed **attackers with Panel access** to store malicious HTML code
  in a tag. The browser of the victim who visited the modified page in the Panel will
  then have rendered this malicious HTML code.\n\nIt also allowed **self-inflicted
  XSS attacks** in the tags field (meaning that malicious code is executed in the
  browser of the user who entered it). This could be used in social engineering attacks
  where a victim is convinced by an attacker to enter malicious code into a tags field.\n\n**Visitors
  without Panel access** could *only* use this attack vector if your site allows changing
  the content of a tags or multiselect field from a frontend form (for example user
  self-registration or the creation of pages from a contact or other frontend form).
  If you validate or sanitize the provided form data, you are already protected against
  such attacks by external visitors.\n\nYou are also *not* affected by these vulnerabilities
  if your site doesn't have untrustworthy users with Panel access or a way to modify
  field values from the frontend or if you don't use the tags or multiselect fields."
