package_slug: "packagist/getkirby/cms"
title: "Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type"
description: "Kirby is a CMS. In Kirby CMS (getkirby/cms) before version 3.4.5, and
  Kirby Panel before version 2.5.14 , an editor with full access to the Kirby Panel
  can upload a PHP .phar file and execute it on the server. This vulnerability is
  critical if you might have potential attackers in your group of authenticated Panel
  users, as they can gain access to the server with such a Phar file. Visitors without
  Panel access *cannot* use this attack vector. The problem has been patched in Kirby
  2.5.14 and Kirby 3.4.5. Please update to one of these or a later version to fix
  the vulnerability. Note: Kirby 2 reaches end of life on December 31, 2020. We therefore
  recommend to upgrade your Kirby 2 sites to Kirby 3. If you cannot upgrade, we still
  recommend to update to Kirby 2.5.14."
