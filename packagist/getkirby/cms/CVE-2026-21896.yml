package_slug: "packagist/getkirby/cms"
title: "Kirby is missing permission checks in the content changes API"
description: "The missing permission checks allowed attackers with Panel access to
  create or discard a changes version or update the content fields in an existing
  changes version. All of these actions could affect arbitrary models.\n\nThis could
  cause the following impact:\n\n- Attackers could maliciously create changes versions
  for all models of the site, creating editing locks that would prevent other authenticated
  users from making content changes until those locks were cleared.\n- Attackers could
  update the content in a malicious way, for example by adding defamatory or spam
  content or by including malicious links or scripts. While this updated content would
  not immediately be published to the site, an inattentive editor with update permissions
  could inadvertently publish these changes in the belief that an authorized user
  has made them.\n- Attackers could discard extensive changes, making editors lose
  their content work."
