title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "Kirby is a content management system. A vulnerability in versions prior
  to 3.5.8.3, 3.6.6.3, 3.7.5.2, 3.8.4.1, and 3.9.6 affects all Kirby sites that might
  have potential attackers in the group of authenticated Panel users or that allow
  external visitors to upload an arbitrary file to the content folder. Kirby sites
  are not affected if they don't allow file uploads for untrusted users or visitors
  or if the file extensions of uploaded files are limited to a fixed safe list. The
  attack requires user interaction by another user or visitor and cannot be automated.\n\nAn
  editor with write access to the Kirby Panel could upload a file with an unknown
  file extension like `.xyz` that contains HTML code including harmful content like
  `<script>` tags. The direct link to that file could be sent to other users or visitors
  of the site. If the victim opened that link in a browser where they are logged in
  to Kirby and the file had not been opened by anyone since the upload, Kirby would
  not be able to send the correct MIME content type, instead falling back to `text/html`.
  The browser would then run the script, which could for example trigger requests
  to Kirby's API with the permissions of the victim.\n\nThe issue was caused by the
  underlying `Kirby\\Http\\Response::file()` method, which didn't have an explicit
  fallback if the MIME type could not be determined from the file extension. If you
  use this method in site or plugin code, these uses may be affected by the same vulnerability.\n\nThe
  problem has been patched in Kirby 3.5.8.3, 3.6.6.3, 3.7.5.2, 3.8.4.1, and 3.9.6.
  In all of the mentioned releases, the maintainers have fixed the affected method
  to use a fallback MIME type of `text/plain` and set the `X-Content-Type-Options:
  nosniff` header if the MIME type of the file is unknown."
