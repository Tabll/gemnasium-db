package_slug: "packagist/getkirby/cms"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "kirby is a content management system (CMS) that adapts to many different
  projects and helps you build your own ideal interface. Cross-site scripting (XSS)
  is a type of vulnerability that allows execution of any kind of JavaScript code
  inside the Panel session of the same or other users. In the Panel, a harmful script
  can for example trigger requests to Kirby's API with the permissions of the victim.
  If bad actors gain access to your group of authenticated Panel users they can escalate
  their privileges via the Panel session of an admin user. Depending on your site,
  other JavaScript-powered attacks are possible. The multiselect field allows selection
  of tags from an autocompleted list. Unfortunately, the Panel in Kirby 3.5 used HTML
  rendering for the raw option value. This allowed **attackers with influence on the
  options source** to store HTML code. The browser of the victim who visited a page
  with manipulated multiselect options in the Panel will then have rendered this malicious
  HTML code when the victim opened the autocomplete dropdown. Users are *not* affected
  by this vulnerability if you don't use the multiselect field or don't use it with
  options that can be manipulated by attackers. The problem has been patched in Kirby
  3.5.8.1."
