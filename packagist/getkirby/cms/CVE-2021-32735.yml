package_slug: "packagist/getkirby/cms"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "Kirby is a content management system. In Kirby CMS versions 3.5.5 and
  3.5.6, the Panel's `ListItem` component (used in the pages and files section for
  example) displayed HTML in page titles as it is. This could be used for cross-site
  scripting (XSS) attacks. Malicious authenticated Panel users can escalate their
  privileges if they get access to the Panel session of an admin user. Visitors without
  Panel access can use the attack vector if the site allows changing site data from
  a frontend form. Kirby 3.5.7 patches the vulnerability. As a partial workaround,
  site administrators can protect against attacks from visitors without Panel access
  by validating or sanitizing provided data from the frontend form."
