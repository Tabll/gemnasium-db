title: "Kirby has insufficient permission checks in the language settings"
description: "The missing permission checks allowed attackers with Panel access to
  manipulate the language definitions.\n\nThe language definitions are at the core
  of multi-language content in Kirby. Unauthorized modifications with malicious intent
  can cause significant damage, for example:\n\n- If the `languages` option was enabled
  but no language exists, creating the first language will switch Kirby to multi-language
  mode.\n- Deleting an existing language will lead to content loss of all translated
  content in that language. Deleting the last language will switch Kirby to single-language
  mode.\n- Updating a language allows to change the metadata including the language
  slug (used in page URLs) and language variables. It also allows to change the default
  language, which will cause Kirby to use the new default language's content as a
  fallback for non-existing translations.\n\nDepending on the site code, the result
  of such actions can cause loss of site availability (e.g. error messages in the
  site frontend) or integrity (due to changed URLs or removed translations)."
