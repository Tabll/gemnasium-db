title: "Origin Validation Error"
description: "Kirby is a CMS. In Kirby CMS (getkirby/cms) before version 3.3.6, and
  Kirby Panel before version 2.5.14 there is a vulnerability in which the admin panel
  may be accessed if hosted on a .dev domain. In order to protect new installations
  on public servers that don't have an admin account for the Panel yet, we block account
  registration there by default. This is a security feature, which we implemented
  years ago in Kirby 2. It helps to avoid that you forget registering your first admin
  account on a public server. In this case – without our security block – someone
  else might theoretically be able to find your site, find out it's running on Kirby,
  find the Panel and then register the account first. It's an unlikely situation,
  but it's still a certain risk. To be able to register the first Panel account on
  a public server, you have to enforce the installer via a config setting. This helps
  to push all users to the best practice of registering your first Panel account on
  your local machine and upload it together with the rest of the site. This installation
  block implementation in Kirby versions before 3.3.6 still assumed that .dev domains
  are local domains, which is no longer true. In the meantime, those domains became
  publicly available. This means that our installation block is no longer working
  as expected if you use a .dev domain for your Kirby site. Additionally the local
  installation check may also fail if your site is behind a reverse proxy. You are
  only affected if you use a .dev domain or your site is behind a reverse proxy and
  you have not yet registered your first Panel account on the public server and someone
  finds your site and tries to login at `yourdomain.dev/panel` before you register
  your first account. You are not affected if you have already created one or multiple
  Panel accounts (no matter if on a .dev domain or behind a reverse proxy). The problem
  has been patched in Kirby 3.3.6. Please upgrade to this or a later version to fix
  the vulnerability."
