title: "Neos Flow Information disclosure in entity security"
description: "If you had used entity security and wanted to secure entities not just
  based on the user's role, but on some property of the user (like the company he
  belongs to), entity security did not work properly together with the doctrine query
  cache. This could lead to other users re-using SQL queries from the cache which
  were built for other users; and thus users could see entities which were not destined
  for them."
