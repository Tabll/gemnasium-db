title: "nova-tiptap has Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload Vulnerability"
description: "A vulnerability was discovered in the marshmallow-packages/nova-tiptap
  Laravel Nova package that allows unauthenticated users to upload arbitrary files
  to any Laravel disk configured in the application.\n\nThe vulnerability is due to:\n•\tMissing
  authentication middleware (Nova and Nova.Auth) on the /nova-tiptap/api/file upload
  endpoint\n•\tLack of validation on uploaded files (no MIME/type or extension restrictions)\n•\tAbility
  for an attacker to choose the disk parameter dynamically\n\nThis means an attacker
  can craft a custom form and send a POST request to /nova-tiptap/api/file, supplying
  a valid CSRF token, and upload executable or malicious files (e.g., .php, binaries)
  to public disks such as local, public, or s3. If a publicly accessible storage path
  is used (e.g. S3 with public access, or Laravel’s public disk), the attacker may
  gain the ability to execute or distribute arbitrary files — amounting to a potential
  Remote Code Execution (RCE) vector in some environments."
