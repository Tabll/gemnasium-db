title: "Hax CMS Stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability"
description: "The application does not sufficiently sanitize user input, allowing
  for the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code. The 'saveNode' and 'saveManifest'
  endpoints take user input and store it in the JSON schema for the site. This content
  is then rendered in the generated HAX site.\n\nAlthough the application does not
  allow users to supply a 'script' tag, it does allow the use of other HTML tags to
  run JavaScript."
