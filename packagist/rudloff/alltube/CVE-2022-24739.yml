package_slug: "packagist/rudloff/alltube"
title: "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
description: "alltube is an html front end for youtube-dl. On releases prior to 3.0.3,
  an attacker could craft a special HTML page to trigger either an open redirect attack
  or a Server-Side Request Forgery attack (depending on how AllTube is configured).
  The impact is mitigated by the fact the SSRF attack is only possible when the `stream`
  option is enabled in the configuration. (This option is disabled by default.) 3.0.3
  contains a fix for this vulnerability."
