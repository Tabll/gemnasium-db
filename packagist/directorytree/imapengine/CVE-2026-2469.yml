title: "ImapEngine affected by command injection via the ID command parameters"
description: "Versions of the package `directorytree/imapengine` before 1.22.3 are
  vulnerable to Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream
  Component ('Injection') via the id() function in ImapConnection.php due to improperly
  escaping user input before including it in IMAP ID commands. This allows attackers
  to read or delete victim's emails, terminate the victim's session or execute any
  valid IMAP command on victim's mailbox by including quote characters `\"` or CRLF
  sequences `\\r\\n` in the input."
