description: "SwagPayPal is a PayPal integration for shopware/platform. If JavaScript-based
  PayPal checkout methods are used (PayPal Plus, Smart Payment Buttons, SEPA, Pay
  Later, Venmo, Credit card), the amount and item list sent to PayPal may not be identical
  to the one in the created order. The problem has been fixed with version 5.4.4.
