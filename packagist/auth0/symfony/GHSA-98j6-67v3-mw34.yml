title: "Auth0 Symfony SDK Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability"
description: "**Overview**\nThe Auth0 Symfony SDK contains a critical vulnerability
  due to insecure deserialization of cookie data. If exploited, since SDKs process
  cookie content without prior authentication, a threat actor could send a specially
  crafted cookie containing malicious serialized data.\n\n\n**Am I Affected?**\nYou
  are affected by this vulnerability if you meet the following preconditions:\n\n1.
  Applications using the Auth0 Symfony SDK, versions between 5.0.0 BETA-0 to 5.0.0.\n2.
  Auth0 Symfony SDK uses the Auth0-PHP SDK with version 8.0.0-BETA3 to 8.3.0.\n\n**Fix**\nUpgrade
  Auth0/symfony to the latest version (v5.4.0).\n\n**Acknowledgement**\nOkta would
  like to thank Andreas Forsblom for discovering this vulnerability."
