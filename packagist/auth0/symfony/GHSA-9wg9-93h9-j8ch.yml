title: "Auth0 Symfony SDK Vulnerable to Brute Force Authentication Tags of CookieStore
  Sessions"
description: "**Overview**\nSession cookies of applications using the Auth0 symfony
  SDK configured with CookieStore have authentication tags that can be brute forced,
  which may result in unauthorized access.\n\n**Am I Affected?**\nYou are affected
  by this vulnerability if you meet the following pre-conditions:\n1. Applications
  using the Auth0 symfony SDK with version <=5.3.1\n2. Auth0/Symfony SDK uses the
  Auth0-PHP SDK with version 8.0.0-BETA1 or higher and below 8.14.0.\n3. Session storage
  configured with CookieStore.\n\n\n**Fix**\nUpgrade Auth0/symfony to v5.4.0. As an
  additional precautionary measure, we recommend rotating your cookie encryption keys.
  Note that once updated, any previous session cookies will be rejected.\n\n**Acknowledgement**\nOkta
  would like to thank FÃ©lix Charette for discovering this vulnerability."
