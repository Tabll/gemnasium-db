package_slug: "packagist/auth0/wordpress"
title: "Login by Auth0 plugin for WordPress vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting"
description: "The Auth0 WordPress plugin allows site administrators to opt-in to allowing
  the use of a `wle` parameter, which can be passed to the WordPress login page by
  end users. When this parameter is supplied using an expected value (which is randomly
  generated by the plugin, by default), the end user can fallback to using WordPress'
  native authentication behavior. (This is generally intended as an emergency fallback
  for administrators to still be able to access their dashboard in the event something
  goes wrong.)\n\nIn previous versions of the plugin, under specific conditions, this
  parameter could potentially accept an arbitrary string that would be improperly
  rendered, potentially allowing for a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack on the login
  page."
