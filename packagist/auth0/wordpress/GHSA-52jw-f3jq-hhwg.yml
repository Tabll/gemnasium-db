title: "Duplicate Advisory: Login by Auth0 plugin for WordPress vulnerable to Reflected
  Cross-Site Scripting"
description: "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is
  a duplicate of GHSA-x6p7-44rh-m3rr. This link has been maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n## Original Description\nThe Login by Auth0 plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘wle’ parameter in all versions
  up to, and including, 4.6.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts
  in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action
  such as clicking on a link."
