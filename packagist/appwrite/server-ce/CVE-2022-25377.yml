title: "Appwrite Directory Traversal vulnerability"
description: "The ACME-challenge endpoint in Appwrite 0.5.0 through 0.12.x before
  0.12.2 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary local files via ../ directory traversal.
  In order to be vulnerable, `APP_STORAGE_CERTIFICATES/.well-known/acme-challenge`
  must exist on disk. (This pathname is automatically created if the user chooses
  to install Let's Encrypt certificates via Appwrite.)"
