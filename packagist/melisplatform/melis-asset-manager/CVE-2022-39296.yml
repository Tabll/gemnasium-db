description: "MelisAssetManager provides deliveries of Melis Platform's assets located
  in every module's public folder. Attackers can read arbitrary files on affected
  versions of `melisplatform/melis-asset-manager`, leading to the disclosure of sensitive
  information. Conducting this attack does not require authentication. Users should
  immediately upgrade to `melisplatform/melis-asset-manager` >= 5.0.1. This issue
  was addressed by restricting access to files to intended directories only."
