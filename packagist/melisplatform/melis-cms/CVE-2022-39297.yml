title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "MelisCms provides a full CMS for Melis Platform, including templating
  system, drag'n'drop of plugins, SEO and many administration tools. Attackers can
  deserialize arbitrary data on affected versions of `melisplatform/melis-cms`, and
  ultimately leads to the execution of arbitrary PHP code on the system. Conducting
  this attack does not require authentication. Users should immediately upgrade to
  `melisplatform/melis-cms` >= 5.0.1. This issue was addressed by restricting allowed
  classes when deserializing user-controlled data."
