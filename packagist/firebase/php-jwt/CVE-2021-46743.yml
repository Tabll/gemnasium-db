- "CVE-2021-46743"
package_slug: "packagist/firebase/php-jwt"
title: "Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')"
description: "In Firebase PHP-JWT before 6.0.0, an algorithm-confusion issue (e.g.,
  RS256 / HS256) exists via the kid (aka Key ID) header, when multiple types of keys
  are loaded in a key ring. This allows an attacker to forge tokens that validate
  under the incorrect key. NOTE: this provides a straightforward way to use the PHP-JWT
  library unsafely, but might not be considered a vulnerability in the library itself."
