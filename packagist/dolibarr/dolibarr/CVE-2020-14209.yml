identifier: "CVE-2020-14209"
package_slug: "packagist/dolibarr/dolibarr"
title: "Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type"
description: "Dolibarr allows low-privilege users to upload files of dangerous types,
  leading to arbitrary code execution. This occurs because `.pht` and `.phar` files
  can be uploaded. Also, an `.htaccess` file can be uploaded to reconfigure access
  control (e.g., to let `.noexe` files be executed as PHP code to defeat the `.noexe`
  protection mechanism)."
