identifier: "CVE-2021-25955"
package_slug: "packagist/dolibarr/dolibarr"
title: "Cross-site Scripting"
description: "In the editor module of the Dolibarr editor scripts are executed in
  a victimâ€™s browser when they open the page containing the vulnerable field. In the
  worst case, the victim who inadvertently triggers the attack is a highly privileged
  administrator. The injected scripts can extract the Session ID, which can lead to
  full Account takeover of the admin and due to other vulnerability (Improper Access
  Control on Private notes) a low privileged user can update the private notes which
  could lead to privilege escalation."
