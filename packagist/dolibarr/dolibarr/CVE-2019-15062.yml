package_slug: "packagist/dolibarr/dolibarr"
title: "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
description: "An issue was discovered in Dolibarr. A user can store an IFRAME element
  (containing a `user/card.php` CSRF request) in his Linked Files settings page. When
  visited by the admin, this could completely take over the admin account. (The protection
  mechanism for CSRF is to check the Referer header; however, because the attack is
  from one of the application's own settings pages, this mechanism is bypassed.)"
