title: "Dolibarr has Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (Bypass)"
description: "The Dolibarr backend provides the function of adding Menu, and supports
  setting permissions for the added Menu:\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wh0amitx/Misc/main/images/image-20240228164114688.png)\n\nThis
  is the trigger point of the vulnerability. The submitted permission can be php code,
  and it will be executed when viewing the created Menu:\n\n- htdocs/admin/menus/edit.php\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wh0amitx/Misc/main/images/image-20240228164445656.png)\n\nAs
  you can see, in edit.php, if the created menu is set to `$menu->perms`, the `dol_eval()`
  method will be called. Following the `dol_eval()` method, we can see that it will
  filter the dangerous php functions in `$menu->perms` through the blocklist set in
  `$forbiddenphpfunctions`:\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wh0amitx/Misc/main/images/image-20240228164725548.png)\n\nHowever,
  the blocklist here is not comprehensive. For example, the `include_once` and `require_once`
  functions can easily pass the blocklist check, which will cause file inclusion vulnerabilities.
  Moreover, if the `allow_url_include` option is enabled in php.ini, arbitrary code
  execution will occur. **The most serious thing is that we can cooperate with the
  file upload at `/htdocs/user/document.php?id=1&uploadform=1` to achieve more general
  arbitrary code execution.**"
