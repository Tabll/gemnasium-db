title: "Dolibarr Application Home Page has HTML injection vulnerability"
description: "Observed a HTML Injection vulnerbaility in the Home page of Dolibarr
  Application. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML tags
  and manipulate the rendered content in the application's response. Specifically,
  I was able to successfully inject a new HTML tag into the returned document and,
  as a result, was able to comment out some part of the Dolibarr App Home page HTML
  code. This behavior can be exploited to perform various attacks like Cross-Site
  Scripting (XSS)."
