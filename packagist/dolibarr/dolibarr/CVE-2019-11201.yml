title: "Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')"
description: "Dolibarr ERP/CRM 9.0.1 provides a module named website that provides
  for creation of public websites with a WYSIWYG editor. It was identified that the
  editor also allowed inclusion of dynamic code, which can lead to code execution
  on the host machine. An attacker has to check a setting on the same page, which
  specifies the inclusion of dynamic content. Thus, a lower privileged user of the
  application can execute code under the context and permissions of the underlying
  web server."
