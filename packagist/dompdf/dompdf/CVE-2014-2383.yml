identifier: "CVE-2014-2383"
package_slug: "packagist/dompdf/dompdf"
title: "Arbitrary file read"
description: "An arbitrary file read vulnerability is present on dompdf.php file that
  allows remote or local attackers to read local files using a special crafted argument.
  This vulnerability requires the configuration flag DOMPDF_ENABLE_PHP to be enabled
  (which is disabled by default). Using PHP protocol and wrappers it is possible to
  bypass the dompdf's \"chroot\" protection (DOMPDF_CHROOT) which prevents dompdf
  from accessing system files or other files on the webserver. Please note that the
  flag DOMPDF_ENABLE_REMOTE needs to be enabled."
