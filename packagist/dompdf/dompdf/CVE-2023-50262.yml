title: "Uncontrolled Recursion"
description: "Dompdf is an HTML to PDF converter for PHP. When parsing SVG images
  Dompdf performs an initial validation to ensure that paths within the SVG are allowed.
  One of the validations is that the SVG document does not reference itself. However,
  prior to version 2.0.4, a recursive chained using two or more SVG documents is not
  correctly validated. Depending on the system configuration and attack pattern this
  could exhaust the memory available to the executing process and/or to the server
  itself.\n\nphp-svg-lib, when run in isolation, does not support SVG references for
  `image` elements. However, when used in combination with Dompdf, php-svg-lib will
  process SVG images referenced by an `image` element. Dompdf currently includes validation
  to prevent self-referential `image` references, but a chained reference is not checked.
  A malicious actor may thus trigger infinite recursion by chaining references between
  two or more SVG images.\n\nWhen Dompdf parses a malicious payload, it will crash
  due after exceeding the allowed execution time or memory usage. An attacker sending
  multiple request to a system can potentially cause resource exhaustion to the point
  that the system is unable to handle incoming request.\n\nVersion 2.0.4 contains
  a fix for this issue."
