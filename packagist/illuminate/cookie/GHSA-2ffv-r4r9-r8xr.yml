title: "Laravel RCE vulnerability in \"cookie\" session driver"
description: "Application's using the \"cookie\" session driver were the primary applications
  affected by this vulnerability. Since we have not yet released a security release
  for the Laravel 5.5 version of the framework, we recommend that all applications
  running Laravel 5.5 and earlier do not use the \"cookie\" session driver in their
  production deployments.\n\nRegarding the vulnerability, applications using the \"cookie\"
  session driver that were also exposing an encryption oracle via their application
  were vulnerable to remote code execution. An encryption oracle is a mechanism where
  arbitrary user input is encrypted and the encrypted string is later displayed or
  exposed to the user. This combination of scenarios lets the user generate valid
  Laravel signed encryption strings for any plain-text string, thus allowing them
  to craft Laravel session payloads when an application is using the \"cookie\" driver.\n\nThis
  fix prefixes cookie values with an HMAC hash of the cookie's name before encryption
  and then verifies a matching hash on decryption, making it impossible to craft a
  valid cookie payload even if an encryption oracle is exposed via the application."
