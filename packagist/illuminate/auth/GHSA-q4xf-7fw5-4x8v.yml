title: "Laravel Hijacked authentication cookies vulnerability"
description: "Laravel 4.1.26 introduces security improvements for \"remember me\"
  cookies. Before this update, if a remember cookie was hijacked by another malicious
  user, the cookie would remain valid for a long period of time, even after the true
  owner of the account reset their password, logged out, etc.\n\nThis change requires
  the addition of a new remember_token column to your users (or equivalent) database
  table. After this change, a fresh token will be assigned to the user each time they
  login to your application. The token will also be refreshed when the user logs out
  of the application. The implications of this change are: if a \"remember me\" cookie
  is hijacked, simply logging out of the application will invalidate the cookie."
