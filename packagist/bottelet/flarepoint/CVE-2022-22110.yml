title: "Weak Password Requirements"
description: "In Daybyday CRM, versions 1.1 through 2.2.0 enforce weak password requirements
  in the user update functionality. A user with privileges to update his password
  could change it to a weak password, such as those with a length of a single character.
  This may allow an attacker to brute-force usersâ€™ passwords with minimal to no computational
  effort."
