description: "Before version 3.7 the bundle is vulnerable to a [security issue in
  JWT](https://auth0.com/blog/critical-vulnerabilities-in-json-web-token-libraries/),
  which can be exploited by an attacker to generate trusted device cookies on their
  own, effectively by-passing two-factor authentication."
