title: "scheb/two-factor-bundle bypass two-factor authentication with remember-me
  option"
description: "In versions prior to 3.26.0 and prior to 4.11.0 of the \"scheb/two-factor-bundle\"
  project, a security vulnerability allowed attackers to bypass two-factor authentication
  (2FA) using the remember_me cookie. When the remember_me checkbox was used during
  login, a \"REMEMBERME\" cookie was created. Upon redirection to the 2FA page, attackers
  could manipulate the SESSIONID key, granting access to the homepage \"/\" and gaining
  authentication without completing 2FA."
