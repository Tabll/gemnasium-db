package_slug: "packagist/slim/psr7"
title: "Interpretation Conflict"
description: "slim/psr7 is a PSR-7 implementation for use with Slim 4. In versions
  prior to 1.6.1 an attacker could sneak in a newline (\\n) into both the header names
  and values. While the specification states that \\r\\n\\r\\n is used to terminate
  the header list, many servers in the wild will also accept \\n\\n. An attacker that
  is able to control the header names that are passed to Slilm-Psr7 would be able
  to intentionally craft invalid messages, possibly causing application errors or
  invalid HTTP requests being sent out with an PSR-18 HTTP client. The latter might
  present a denial of service vector if a remote serviceâ€™s web application firewall
  bans the application due to the receipt of malformed requests. The issue has been
  patched in version 1.6.1. There are no known workarounds to this issue. Users are
  advised to upgrade."
