title: "SimpleSAMLphp xml-common XXE vulnerability"
description: "Summary\n\nWhen loading an (untrusted) XML document, for example the
  SAMLResponse, it's possible to induce an XXE.\n\n$options is defined as: https://github.com/simplesamlphp/xml-common/blob/v1.19.0/src/DOMDocumentFactory.php#L39\nincluding
  the DTDLoad option, which allows an attacker to read file contents from local file
  system OR internal network.\n\nWhile there is the NONET option, an attacker can
  simply bypass if by using PHP filters:\nphp://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=http://URL
  OR FILE\n\nFrom there an attacker can induce network connections and steal the targeted
  file OOB (haven't fully tested this).\n\nRCE may be possible with the php://expect
  or php://phar wrappers, but this hasn't been tested.\n\nNote:\nThe mitigation here:\nhttps://github.com/simplesamlphp/xml-common/blob/v1.19.0/src/DOMDocumentFactory.php#L58\nComes
  too late, as the XML has already been loaded into a document.\nMitigation:\n\nRemove
  the LIBXML_DTDLOAD | LIBXML_DTDATTR options.\nAdditionally, as a defense in depth
  measure, check if there is the string: <!DOCTYPE inside the XML before parsing it.
  (This is not a complete fix because someone may be able to exploit some parser differentials,
  to load a DOCTYPE, maybe through spacing like: <! DOCTYPE)"
