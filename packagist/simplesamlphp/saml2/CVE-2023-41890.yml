package_slug: "packagist/simplesamlphp/saml2"
title: "Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name"
description: "Sustainsys.Saml2 library adds SAML2P support to ASP.NET web sites, allowing
  the web site to act as a SAML2 Service Provider. \nPrior to versions 1.0.3 and 2.9.2,
  when a response is processed, the issuer of the Identity Provider is not sufficiently
  validated. This could allow a malicious identity provider to craft a Saml2 response
  that is processed as if issued by another identity provider. It is also possible
  for a malicious end user to cause stored state intended for one identity provider
  to be used when processing the response from another provider. An application is
  impacted if they rely on any of these features in their authentication/authorization
  logic: the issuer of the generated identity and claims; or items in the stored request
  state (AuthenticationProperties). This issue is patched in versions 2.9.2 and 1.0.3.
  The `AcsCommandResultCreated` notification can be used to add the validation required
  if an upgrade to patched packages is not possible."
