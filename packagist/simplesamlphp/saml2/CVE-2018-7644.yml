identifier: "CVE-2018-7644"
package_slug: "packagist/simplesamlphp/saml2"
title: "Improper signature validation"
description: "The `XmlSecLibs` library as used in the saml2 library in SimpleSAMLphp
  incorrectly verifies signatures on SAML assertions, allowing a remote attacker to
  construct a crafted SAML assertion on behalf of an Identity Provider that would
  pass as cryptographically valid, thereby allowing them to impersonate a user from
  that Identity Provider, aka a key confusion issue."
