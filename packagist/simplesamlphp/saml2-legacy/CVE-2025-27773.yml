title: "The SimpleSAMLphp SAML2 library incorrectly verifies signatures for HTTP-Redirect
  binding"
description: "There's a signature confusion attack in the HTTPRedirect binding. An
  attacker with any signed SAMLResponse via the HTTP-Redirect binding can cause the
  application to accept an unsigned message.\n\nI believe that it exists for v4 only.
  I have not yet developed a PoC.\n\nV5 is well designed and instead builds the signed
  query from the same message that will be consumed."
