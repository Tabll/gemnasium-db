title: "SimpleSAMLphp Information Disclosure vulnerability"
description: "The new admin interface includes a way to view information about the
  host where SimpleSAMLphp is installed, by means of the phpinfo() PHP function. An
  endpoint that exposes the output of that function is included in the admin module
  for easier debugging.\n\nThe aforementioned endpoint had no checks for administrator
  privileges. This would allow any individual to access the given endpoint without
  authenticating, gathering information about the affected system."
