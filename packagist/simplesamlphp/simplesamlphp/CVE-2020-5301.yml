identifier: "CVE-2020-5301"
package_slug: "packagist/simplesamlphp/simplesamlphp"
title: "Information Exposure"
description: "SimpleSAMLphp contain an information disclosure vulnerability. The module
  controller in `SimpleSAML\\Module` that processes requests for pages hosted by modules,
  has code to identify paths ending with `.php` and process those as PHP code. If
  no other suitable way of handling the given path exists, it presents the file to
  the browser. The check to identify paths ending with `.php` does not account for
  uppercase letters. If someone requests a path ending with e.g. `.PHP` and the server
  is serving the code from a case-insensitive file system, such as on Windows, the
  processing of the PHP code does not occur, and the source code is instead presented
  to the browser. An attacker may use this issue to gain access to the source code
  in third-party modules that is meant to be private, or even sensitive. However,
  the attack surface is considered small, as the attack will only work when SimpleSAMLphp
  serves such content from a file system that is not case-sensitive, such as on Windows."
