title: "SimpleSAMLphp exposes credentials in session storage"
description: "When an authentication request is received via the ECP profile, the
  username and password obtained this way were saved to the state array, which is
  used to pass relevant data to different routines that may need it. This is not a
  problem in itself. However, when the ECP profile is disabled in the Identity Provider,
  other bindings such as HTTP-POST or HTTP-Redirect will be used, and since redirections
  are involved, the state array is then persisted to the user’s session, effectively
  storing it in the session backend.\n\nThe ECP profile, which uses the SOAP and PAOS
  bindings, does not involve any HTTP redirection for the user, and for that reason
  the state array containing the credentials is never persisted to the session. The
  logic for determining when to save the credentials to the state array assumed wrongly,
  though, that if the authentication request came in on the SOAP binding, that means
  the ECP profile is used. This may not be true as ECP can be disabled by configuration
  in the IdP’s hosted SAML metadata, and in that case SimpleSAMLphp would then try
  to default to a binding different than PAOS, such as HTTP-POST or HTTP-Redirect,
  effectively consolidating the entire state array to the user’s session as described
  before.\n\nIn practice, any Identity Provider with the ECP profile disabled but
  metadata for an entity that supports ECP, would reject incoming ECP requests, but
  write the credentials obtained in the request to the user’s session, which will
  be stored in the session store, whichever is used (local file system in case PHP
  sessions are used, Memcache, Redis, relational databases, etc)."
