title: "Link injection in SimpleSAMLphp"
description: "### Background\nSeveral scripts part of SimpleSAMLphp display a web
  page with links obtained from the request parameters. This allows us to enhance
  usability, as the users are presented with links they can follow after completing
  a certain action, like logging out.\n\n### Description\nThe following scripts were
  not checking the URLs obtained via the HTTP request before displaying them as the
  target of links that the user may click on:\n\n- `www/logout.php`\n- `modules/core/www/no_cookie.php`\n\nThe
  issue allowed attackers to display links targeting a malicious website inside a
  trusted site running SimpleSAMLphp, due to the lack of security checks involving
  the `link_href` and `retryURL` HTTP parameters, respectively. The issue was resolved
  by including a verification of the URLs received in the request against a white
  list of websites specified in the `trusted.url.domains` configuration option.\n\n###
  Affected versions\nAll SimpleSAMLphp versions prior to 1.14.4.\n\n### Impact\nA
  remote attacker could craft a link pointing to a trusted website running SimpleSAMLphp,
  including a parameter pointing to a malicious website, and try to fool the victim
  into visiting that website by clicking on a link in the page presented by SimpleSAMLphp.\n\n###
  Resolution\nUpgrade to the latest version.\n\n### Credit\nThis security issue was
  discovered and reported by John Page (hyp3rlinx)."
