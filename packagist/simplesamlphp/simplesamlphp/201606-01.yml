title: "Link injection"
description: "`www/logout.php` and `modules/core/www/no_cookie.php` are not checking
  the URLs obtained via the HTTP request before displaying them as the target of links
  that the user may click on. It allows attackers to display links targeting a malicious
  website inside a trusted site running SimpleSAMLphp, due to the lack of security
  checks involving the `link_href` and `retryURL` HTTP parameters, respectively."
