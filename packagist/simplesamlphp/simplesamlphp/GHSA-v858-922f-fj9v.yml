title: "SimpleSAMLphp Link Injection vulnerability"
description: "The following scripts were not checking the URLs obtained via the HTTP
  request before displaying them as the target of links that the user may click on:\n\n-
  www/logout.php\n- modules/core/www/no_cookie.php\nThe issue allowed attackers to
  display links targeting a malicious website inside a trusted site running SimpleSAMLphp,
  due to the lack of security checks involving the link_href and retryURL HTTP parameters,
  respectively. The issue was resolved by including a verification of the URLs received
  in the request against a white list of websites specified in the trusted.url.domains
  configuration option."
