identifier: "CVE-2016-9955"
package_slug: "packagist/simplesamlphp/simplesamlphp"
title: "Incorrect signature verification of SAML 1 messages"
description: "An incorrect check of return values in the signature validation utilities
  allows an attacker to get invalid signatures accepted as valid by forcing an error
  during validation. This allows attackers to modify or manually craft **SAML 1 response
  messages** and, by triggering a signature validation error in the affected party,
  get those messages accepted as valid and coming from a trusted entity. In practice,
  this means full capabilities to impersonate any individual at a given service provider.
  This vulnerability is not to be confused with the one described in 201612-01 and
  related to SAML 2 messages."
