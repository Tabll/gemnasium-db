identifier: "CVE-2020-5225"
package_slug: "packagist/simplesamlphp/simplesamlphp"
title: "Inclusion of Sensitive Information in Log Files"
description: "Log injection in `SimpleSAMLphp` before version. The `www/erroreport.php`
  script, which receives error reports and sends them via email to the system administrator,
  did not properly sanitize the report identifier obtained from the request. This
  allows an attacker, under specific circumstances, to inject new log lines by manually
  crafting this report ID. When configured to use the file logging handler, `SimpleSAMLphp`
  will output all its logs by appending each log line to a given file. Since the `reportID`
  parameter received in a request sent to `www/errorreport.php` was not properly sanitized,
  it was possible to inject newline characters into it, effectively allowing a malicious
  user to inject new log lines with arbitrary content."
