title: "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature"
description: "A SimpleSAMLphp Service Provider using SAML will regard as valid any
  unsigned SAML response containing more than one signed assertion, provided that
  the signature of at least one of the assertions is valid. Attributes contained in
  all the assertions received will be merged and the entityID of the first assertion
  received will be used, allowing an attacker to impersonate any user of any IdP given
  an assertion signed by the targeted IdP."
