package_slug: "packagist/cuyz/valinor"
title: "Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information"
description: "Valinor is a PHP library that helps to map any input into a strongly-typed
  value object structure. Prior to version 0.12.0, Valinor can use `Throwable#getMessage()`
  when it should not have permission to do so. This is a problem with cases such as
  an SQL exception showing an SQL snippet, a database connection exception showing
  database IP address/username/password, or a timeout detail / out of memory detail.
  Attackers could use this information for potential data exfiltration, denial of
  service attacks, enumeration attacks, etc. Version 0.12.0 contains a patch for this
  vulnerability."
