title: "TYPO3-EXT-SA-2025-001: Account Takeover in extension \"OpenID Connect Authentication\"
  (oidc)"
description: "## Problem Description\nA vulnerability in the account linking logic
  of the extension allows a pre-hijacking attack leading to Account Takeover. The
  attack can only be exploited if the following requirements are met:\n\n- An attacker
  can anticipate the email address of the user.\n- An attacker can register a public
  frontend user account using that email address before the user's first OIDC login.\n-
  The IDP returns the field email containing the email address of the user\n\n## Solution\nAn
  updated versions 4.0.0 is available from the TYPO3 extension manager, packagist
  and at \nhttps://extensions.typo3.org/extension/download/oidc/4.0.0/zip\n\nUsers
  of the extension are advised to update the extension as soon as possible."
