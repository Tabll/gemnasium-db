title: "OpenID Connect Authentication (oidc) Typo3 extension Authentication Bypass"
description: "The authentication service of the extension does not verify the OpenID
  Connect authentication state from the user lookup chain. Instead, the authentication
  service authenticates every valid frontend user from the user lookup chain, where
  the  frontend user field “tx_oidc” is not empty.\n\nIn scenarios, where either ext:felogin
  is active or where `$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS'][‘FE’][‘checkFeUserPid’]` is disabled,
  an attacker can login to OpenID Connect frontend user accounts by providing a valid
  username and any password."
