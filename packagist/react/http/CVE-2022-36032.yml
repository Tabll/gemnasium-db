title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "ReactPHP HTTP is a streaming HTTP client and server implementation for
  ReactPHP. In ReactPHP's HTTP server component versions starting with 0.7.0 and prior
  to 1.7.0, when ReactPHP is processing incoming HTTP cookie values, the cookie names
  are url-decoded. This may lead to cookies with prefixes like `__Host-` and `__Secure-`
  confused with cookies that decode to such prefix, thus leading to an attacker being
  able to forge cookie which is supposed to be secure. This issue is fixed in ReactPHP
  HTTP version 1.7.0. As a workaround, Infrastructure or DevOps can place a reverse
  proxy in front of the ReactPHP HTTP server to filter out any unexpected `Cookie`
  request headers."
