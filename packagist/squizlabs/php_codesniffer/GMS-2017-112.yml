title: "Arbitrary shell execution"
description: "This release contains a fix for a security advisory related to the improper
  handling of shell commands. Uses of `shell_exec()` and `exec()` were not escaping
  filenames and configuration settings in most cases A properly crafted filename or
  configuration option would allow for arbitrary code execution when using some features."
