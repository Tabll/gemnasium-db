title: "Firefly III has a MFA bypass in oauth flow"
description: "A MFA bypass in the Firefly III OAuth flow may allow malicious users
  to bypass the MFA-check. This allows malicious users to use password spraying to
  gain access to your Firefly III data using passwords stolen from other sources.
  As OAuth applications are easily enumerable using an incrementing id, an attacker
  could try sign an OAuth application up to a users profile quite easily if they have
  created one. The attacker would also need to know the victims username and password."
