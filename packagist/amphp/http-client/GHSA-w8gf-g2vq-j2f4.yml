title: "amphp/http-client  Denial of Service via HTTP/2 CONTINUATION Frames"
description: "Early versions of `amphp/http-client` with HTTP/2 support (v4.0.0-rc10
  to 4.0.0) will collect HTTP/2 `CONTINUATION` frames in an unbounded buffer and will
  not check the header size limit until it has received the `END_HEADERS` flag, resulting
  in an OOM crash. Later versions of `amphp/http-client` (v4.1.0-rc1 and up) depend
  on `amphp/http` for HTTP/2 processing and will therefore need an updated version
  of `amphp/http`, see [GHSA-qjfw-cvjf-f4fm](https://github.com/amphp/http/security/advisories/GHSA-qjfw-cvjf-f4fm)."
