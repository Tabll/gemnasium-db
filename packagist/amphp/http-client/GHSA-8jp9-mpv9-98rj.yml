title: "amphp/http-client Header leakage on cross-domain redirects"
description: "amphp/http-client has a security weakness that might leak sensitive
  request headers from the initial request to the redirected host on cross-domain
  redirects, which were not removed correctly. `Message::setHeaders` does not replace
  the entire set of headers, but only operates on the headers matching the given array
  keys."
