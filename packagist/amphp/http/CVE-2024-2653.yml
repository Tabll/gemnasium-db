title: "AMPHP Denial of Service via HTTP/2 CONTINUATION Frames"
description: "`amphp/http` will collect HTTP/2 `CONTINUATION` frames in an unbounded
  buffer and will not check the header size limit until it has received the `END_HEADERS`
  flag, resulting in an OOM crash. `amphp/http-client` and `amphp/http-server` are
  indirectly affected if they're used with an unpatched version of `amphp/http`. Early
  versions of `amphp/http-client` with HTTP/2 support (v4.0.0-rc10 to 4.0.0) are also
  directly affected."
