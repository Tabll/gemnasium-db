title: "amphp/http-server affected by HTTP/2 DDoS vulnerability"
description: "Versions of `amphp/http-server` prior to `3.4.4` for the 3.x release
  branch and prior to `2.1.10` for the 2.x release branch are vulnerable to the HTTP/2
  \"MadeYouReset\" DoS attack described by CVE-2025-8671 and https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/767506.\n\nIn
  versions `3.4.4` and `2.1.10`, stream reset protection has been refactored to account
  for the number of reset streams within a sliding time window.\n\nNote that your
  application must expose HTTP/2 connections directly to be affected by this vulnerability.
  Servers behind a proxy using HTTP/1.x such as nginx are not affected."
