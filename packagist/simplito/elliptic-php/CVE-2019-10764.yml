package_slug: "packagist/simplito/elliptic-php"
title: "Observable Discrepancy"
description: "In elliptic-php versions priot to 1.0.6, Timing attacks might be possible
  which can result in practical recovery of the long-term private key generated by
  the library under certain conditions. Leakage of a bit-length of the scalar during
  scalar multiplication is possible on an elliptic curve which might allow practical
  recovery of the long-term private key."
