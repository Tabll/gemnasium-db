title: "External Control of System or Configuration Setting"
description: "php-svg-lib is an SVG file parsing / rendering library. Prior to version
  0.5.1, when handling `<use>` tag that references an `<image>` tag, it merges the
  attributes from the `<use>` tag to the `<image>` tag. The problem pops up especially
  when the `href` attribute from the `<use>` tag has not been sanitized. This can
  lead to an unsafe file read that can cause PHAR Deserialization vulnerability in
  PHP prior to version 8. Version 0.5.1 contains a patch for this issue. "
