title: "Dompdf's usage of vulnerable version of phenx/php-svg-lib leads to restriction
  bypass and potential RCE"
description: "### Summary\nA lack of sanitization/check in the font path returned
  by php-svg-lib, in the case of a inline CSS font defined, that will be used by Cpdf
  to open a font will be passed to a `file_exists` call, which is sufficient to trigger
  metadata unserializing on a PHAR file, through the phar:// URL handler on PHP <
  8.0. On other versions, it might be used as a way to get a SSRF through, for example,
  ftp, not restricted by authorized protocols configured on dompdf.\n\n### Details\nThe
  problem lies on the `openFont` function of the `lib/Cpdf.php` library, when the
  `$font` variable passed by php-svg-lib isn't checked correctly. A path is crafted
  through $name and $dir, which are two values that can be controlled through CSS
  : \n\n```\n$name = basename($font);\n$dir = dirname($font);\n[...]\n$metrics_name
  = \"$name.ufm\";\n[...]\n\nif (!isset($this->fonts[$font]) && file_exists(\"$dir/$metrics_name\"))
  {\n```\n\nPassing a font named `phar:///foo/bar/baz.phar/test` will set the value
  of $name to `test` and $dir to `phar:///foo/bar/baz.phar`, which once reconstructed
  will call file_exists on `phar:///foo/bar/baz.phar/test.ufm`. That allows to deserialize
  the `baz.phar` arbitrary file that contains a `test.ufm` file in the archive."
