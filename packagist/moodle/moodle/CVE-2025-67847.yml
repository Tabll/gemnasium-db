title: "Moodle affected by a code injection vulnerability"
description: "A flaw was found in Moodle. An attacker with access to the restore interface
  could trigger server-side execution of arbitrary code. This is due to insufficient
  validation of restore input, which leads to unintended interpretation by core restore
  routines. Successful exploitation could result in a full compromise of the Moodle
  application."
