title: "Moodle Session Fixation allows unauthenticated users to hijack sessions via
  sesskey parameter"
description: "A session fixation vulnerability in Moodle 3.x through 3.11.18 allows
  unauthenticated attackers to hijack user sessions via the sesskey parameter. The
  sesskey can be obtained without authentication and reused within the OAuth2 login
  flow, resulting in the victim's session being linked to the attacker's. Successful
  exploitation results in full account takeover. According to the Moodle Releases
  page, \"Bug fixes for security issues in 3.11.x ended 11 December 2023.\" NOTE:
  This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer."
