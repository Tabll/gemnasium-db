title: "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
description: "A vulnerability was found in Moodle which exists due to insufficient
  validation of the HTTP request origin in course redirect URL. A user's CSRF token
  was unnecessarily included in the URL when being redirected to a course they have
  just restored. A remote attacker can trick the victim to visit a specially crafted
  web page and perform arbitrary actions on behalf of the victim on the vulnerable
  website. This flaw allows an attacker to perform cross-site request forgery attacks."
