package_slug: "packagist/moodle/moodle"
title: "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
description: "A blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability was found in
  Moodle. This flaw exists due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in
  LTI provider library. The library does not utilise Moodle's inbuilt cURL helper,
  which resulted in a blind SSRF risk. An attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP
  request and trick the application to initiate requests to arbitrary systems. This
  vulnerability allows a remote attacker to perform SSRF attacks."
