title: "Moodle allows unauthenticated REST API user data exposure"
description: "A flaw has been identified in Moodle where, on certain sites, unauthenticated
  users could retrieve sensitive user dataâ€”including names, contact information, and
  hashed passwordsâ€”via stack traces returned by specific API calls. Sites where PHP
  is configured with zend.exception_ignore_args = 'On' or zend.exception_ignore_args
  = 1 in the relevant php.ini file are NOT affected by this vulnerability. Sites that
  do not have the zend.exception_ignore_args setting enabled and are using the internal
  Moodle LMS authentication system are affected by this vulnerability."
