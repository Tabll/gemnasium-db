title: "Moodle formula injection vulnerability"
description: "A flaw was found in Moodle. This formula injection vulnerability occurs
  when data fields are exported without proper escaping. A remote attacker could exploit
  this by providing malicious data that, when exported and opened in a spreadsheet,
  allows arbitrary formulas to execute. This can lead to compromised data integrity
  and unintended operations within the spreadsheet."
