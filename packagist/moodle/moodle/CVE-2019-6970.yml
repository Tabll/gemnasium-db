package_slug: "packagist/moodle/moodle"
title: "Moodle SSRF Vulnerability"
description: "The `edit_blog.php` script allows a registered user to add external
  RSS feed resources. It was identified that this feature could be abused to be used
  as a SSRF attack vector by adding a malicious URL/TCP PORT in order to target internal
  network or an internet hosted server, bypassing firewall rules, IP filtering and
  more.\n\nThis kind of vulnerability is then called “blind” because of no response
  available on Moodle web site, enforcing attacker to exploit it using a “time based”
  approach."
