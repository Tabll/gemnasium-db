title: "Moodle vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting"
description: "A flaw was found in Moodle. This vulnerability, known as Cross-site
  Scripting (XSS), occurs due to insufficient checks on user-provided data in the
  formula editor's arithmetic expression fields. A remote attacker could inject malicious
  code into these fields. When other users view these expressions, the malicious code
  would execute in their web browsers, potentially compromising their data or leading
  to unauthorized actions."
