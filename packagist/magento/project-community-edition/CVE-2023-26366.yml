title: "Magento Open Source allows Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
description: "Adobe Commerce versions 2.4.7-beta1 (and earlier), 2.4.6-p2 (and earlier),
  2.4.5-p4 (and earlier) and 2.4.4-p5 (and earlier) are affected by a Server-Side
  Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability that could lead to arbitrary file system read.
  A high-privileged authenticated attacker can force the application to make arbitrary
  requests via injection of arbitrary URLs. Exploitation of this issue does not require
  user interaction, scope is changed due to the fact that an attacker can enforce
  file read outside the application's path boundary."
