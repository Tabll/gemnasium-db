  2.4.4-p15 and earlier are affected by a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
  that could be abused by a high-privileged attacker to inject malicious scripts into
  vulnerable form fields. Malicious JavaScript may be executed in a victim’s browser
  when they browse to the page containing the vulnerable field. A successful attacker
  can abuse this to achieve session takeover, increasing the confidentiality, and
  integrity impact to high. Exploitation of this issue requires user interaction in
