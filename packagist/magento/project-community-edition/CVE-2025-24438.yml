description: "Adobe Commerce versions 2.4.7-beta1, 2.4.7-p3, 2.4.6-p8, 2.4.5-p10,
  2.4.4-p11 and earlier are affected by a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
  that could be abused by a low-privileged attacker to inject malicious scripts into
  vulnerable form fields. Malicious JavaScript may be executed in a victimâ€™s browser
