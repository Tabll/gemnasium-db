title: "Magento Patch SUPEE-9652 - Remote Code Execution using mail vulnerability"
description: "Zend Framework 1 vulnerability can be remotely exploited to execute
  code in Magento 1. While the issue is not reproducible in Magento 2, the library
  code is the same so it was fixed as well.\n\nNote: while the vulnerability is scored
  as critical, few systems are affected. To be affected by the vulnerability the installation
  has to:\n\n- use sendmail as the mail transport agent\n\n- have specific, non-default
  configuration settings as described [here](https://magento.com/security/patches/supee-9652#:~:text=settings%20as%20described-,here,-.)."
