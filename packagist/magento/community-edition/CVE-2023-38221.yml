description: "Adobe Commerce versions 2.4.7-beta1 (and earlier), 2.4.6-p2 (and earlier),
  2.4.5-p4 (and earlier) and 2.4.4-p5 (and earlier) are affected by an Improper Neutralization
  of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') vulnerability that
  could lead in arbitrary code execution by an admin-privilege authenticated attacker.
  Exploitation of this issue does not require user interaction and attack complexity
  is high as it requires knowledge of tooling beyond just using the UI."
