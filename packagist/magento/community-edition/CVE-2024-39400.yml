title: "Magento DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability"
description: "Magento versions 2.4.7-p1, 2.4.6-p6, 2.4.5-p8, 2.4.4-p9 and earlier
  are affected by a DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This vulnerability
  could allow an admin attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within
  the context of the user's browser session. Exploitation of this issue requires user
  interaction, such as convincing a victim to click on a malicious link. Confidentiality
  and integrity impact is high as it affects other admin accounts."
