title: "Magento Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability "
description: "Magento versions 2.4.7-p1, 2.4.6-p6, 2.4.5-p8, 2.4.4-p9 and earlier
  are affected by a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability that could be
  abused by a low-privileged attacker to inject malicious scripts into vulnerable
  form fields. Malicious JavaScript may be executed in a victim’s browser when they
  browse to the page containing the vulnerable field. Confidentiality impact is high
  due to the attacker being able to exfiltrate sensitive information."
