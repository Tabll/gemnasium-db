title: "datadog/dd-trace Circumvents open_basedir INI directive"
description: "datadog/dd-trace versions 0.30.0 prior to 0.30.2 are affected by a security
  and stability issue outlined in PR [#579](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-php/pull/579).
  This pull request ensures that the ddtrace.request_init_hook remains bound by the
  open_basedir INI directive, effectively addressing potential vulnerabilities related
  to open_basedir restrictions.\nThe update introduces a sandboxing mechanism to isolate
  the request init hook from errors or exceptions during execution, enhancing the
  library's stability and preventing adverse impacts on the main script."
