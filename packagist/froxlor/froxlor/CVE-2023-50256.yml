package_slug: "packagist/froxlor/froxlor"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "Froxlor is open source server administration software. Prior to version
  2.1.2, it was possible to submit the registration form with the essential fields,
  such as the username and password, left intentionally blank. This inadvertent omission
  allowed for a bypass of the mandatory field requirements (e.g. surname, company
  name) established by the system. Version 2.1.2 fixes this issue.\n"
