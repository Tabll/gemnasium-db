title: "Froxlor allows Multiple Accounts to Share the Same Email Address Leading to
  Potential Privilege Escalation or Account Takeover"
description: "the vulnerability is that users (such as resellers or customers) are
  able to create accounts with the same email address as an existing account (e.g.,
  if the admin has [admin@froxlor.com](mailto:admin@froxlor.com), others can also
  create an account using the same email). This creates potential issues with account
  identification and security."
