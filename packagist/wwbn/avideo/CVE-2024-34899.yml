title: "AVideo cross-site scripting vulnerability in the view/about.php page"
description: "The PHP file view/about.php is vulnerable to an XSS issue due to no
  sanitization of the user agent.\n\nAt line [53], the website gets the user-agent
  from the headers through $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] and echo it without any sanitization.\n\nIn
  PHP, echo a user generated statement, here the User-Agent Header, without any sanitization
  allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the output of a web page, which
  are then executed in the browser of anyone viewing that page."
