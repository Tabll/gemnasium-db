title: "AVideo has Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Markdown Comment Injection"
description: "AVideo allows Markdown in video comments and uses Parsedown (v1.7.4)
  without Safe Mode enabled. Markdown links are not sufficiently sanitized, allowing
  `javascript:` URIs to be rendered as clickable links.\n\nAn authenticated low-privilege
  attacker can post a malicious comment that injects persistent JavaScript. When another
  user clicks the link, the attacker can perform actions such as session hijacking,
  privilege escalation (including admin takeover), and data exfiltration."
