package_slug: "packagist/robrichards/xmlseclibs"
title: "robrichards/xmlseclibs has an Libxml2 Canonicalization error which can bypass
  Digest/Signature validation"
description: "An authentication bypass vulnerability exists due to a flaw in the libxml2
  canonicalization process, which is used by [xmlseclibs](https://github.com/robrichards/xmlseclibs)
  during document transformation. This weakness allows an attacker to generate a valid
  signature once and reuse it indefinitely. In practice, a signature created during
  a previous interaction - or through a misconfigured authentication flow - can be
  replayed to bypass authentication checks."
