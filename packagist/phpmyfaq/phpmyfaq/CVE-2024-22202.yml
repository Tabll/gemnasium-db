title: "Improper Access Control"
description: "phpMyFAQ is an open source FAQ web application for PHP 8.1+ and MySQL,
  PostgreSQL and other databases. phpMyFAQ's user removal page allows an attacker
  to spoof another user's detail, and in turn make a compelling phishing case for
  removing another user's account. The front-end of this page does not allow changing
  the form details, an attacker can utilize a proxy to intercept this request and
  submit other data. Upon submitting this form, an email is sent to the administrator
  informing them that this user wants to delete their account. An administrator has
  no way of telling the difference between the actual user wishing to delete their
  account or the attacker issuing this for an account they do not control. This issue
  has been patched in version 3.2.5."
