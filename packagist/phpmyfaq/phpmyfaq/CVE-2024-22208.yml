title: "Incorrect Authorization"
description: "phpMyFAQ is an Open Source FAQ web application for PHP 8.1+ and MySQL,
  PostgreSQL and other databases. The 'sharing FAQ' functionality allows any unauthenticated
  actor to misuse the phpMyFAQ application to send arbitrary emails to a large range
  of targets. The phpMyFAQ application has a functionality where anyone can share
  a FAQ item to others. The front-end of this functionality allows any phpMyFAQ articles
  to be shared with 5 email addresses. Any unauthenticated actor can perform this
  action. There is a CAPTCHA in place, however the amount of people you email with
  a single request is not limited to 5 by the backend. An attacker can thus solve
  a single CAPTCHA and send thousands of emails at once. An attacker can utilize the
  target application's email server to send phishing messages. This can get the server
  on a block list, causing all emails to end up in spam. It can also lead to reputation
  damages. This issue has been patched in version 3.2.5."
