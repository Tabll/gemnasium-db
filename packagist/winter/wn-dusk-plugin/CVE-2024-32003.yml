title: "Dusk plugin may allow unfettered user authentication in misconfigured installs"
description: "The Dusk plugin provides some special routes as part of its testing
  framework to allow a browser environment (such as headless Chrome) to act as a user
  in the Backend or User plugin without having to go through authentication. This
  route is `[[URL]]/_dusk/login/[[USER ID]]/[[MANAGER]]` - where `[[URL]]` is the
  base URL of the site, `[[USER ID]]` is the ID of the user account and `[[MANAGER]]`
  is the authentication manager (either `backend` for Backend, or `user` for the User
  plugin).\n\nIf a configuration of a site using the Dusk plugin is set up in such
  a way that the Dusk plugin is available publicly and the test cases in Dusk are
  run with live data, this route may potentially be used to gain access to any user
  account in either the Backend or User plugin without authentication.\n\nAs indicated
  in the [README](https://github.com/wintercms/wn-dusk-plugin/blob/main/README.md),
  this plugin should only be used in development and should *NOT* be used in a production
  instance. It is specifically recommended that the plugin be installed as a development
  dependency only in Composer.\n\nIn order to remediate this issue, the special routes
  used above will now no longer be registered unless the `APP_ENV` environment variable
  is specifically set to `dusk`. Since Winter by default does not use this environment
  variable and it is not populated by default, it will only exist if Dusk's automatic
  configuration is used (which won't exhibit this vulnerability) or if a developer
  manually specifies it in their configuration.\n\nThe automatic configuration performed
  by the Dusk plugin has also been hardened by default to use sane defaults and not
  allow external environment variables to leak into this configuration."
