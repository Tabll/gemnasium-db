title: "Winter CMS Modules allows a sandbox bypass in Twig templates leading to data
  modification and deletion"
description: "Affected versions of Winter CMS allow users with access to the CMS templates
  sections that modify Twig files to bypass the sandbox placed on Twig files and modify
  resources such as theme customisation values or modify, or remove, templates in
  the theme even if not provided direct access via the permissions.\n\nAs all objects
  passed through to Twig are references to the live objects, it is also possible to
  also manipulate model data if models are passed directly to Twig, including changing
  attributes or even removing records entirely. In most cases, this is unwanted behavior
  and potentially dangerous.\n\nTo actively exploit this security issue, an attacker
  would need access to the Backend with a user account with any of the following permissions:\n-
  `cms.manage_layouts`\n- `cms.manage_pages`\n- `cms.manage_partials`\n\nThe Winter
  CMS maintainers strongly recommend that these permissions only be reserved to trusted
  administrators and developers in general."
