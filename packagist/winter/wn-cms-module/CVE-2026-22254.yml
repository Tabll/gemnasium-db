description: "Affected versions of Winter CMS allow users with access to the CMS Asset
  Manager were able to upload SVGs without automatic sanitization.\n\nTo actively
  exploit this security issue, an attacker would need access to the Backend with a
  user account with the following permission: `cms.manage_assets`\n\nThe Winter CMS

  to trusted administrators and developers in general."
