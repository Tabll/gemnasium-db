title: "PHP Object Injection Vulnerability"
description: "There's a PHP Object Injection vulnerability that can be triggered through
  the `saveLayout()` method defined into the `/plugins/Dashboard/Controller.php` script.
  Since Piwik is not using \"utf8mb4\" collations for its database, this can be exploited
  in combination with a MySQL UTF8 truncation issue in order to corrupt the session
  array, allowing unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary PHP objects into the
  application scope and carry out Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks, delete
  arbitrary files, execute arbitrary PHP code, and possibly other attacks. "
