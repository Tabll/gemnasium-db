package_slug: "packagist/ssddanbrown/bookstack"
title: "Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type"
description: "BookStack before version 0.25.5 has a vulnerability where a user could
  upload PHP files through image upload functions, which would allow them to execute
  code on the host system remotely. They would then have the permissions of the PHP
  process. This most impacts scenarios where non-trusted users are given permission
  to upload images in any area of the application. The issue was addressed in a series
  of patches in versions 0.25.3, 0.25.4 and 0.25.5. Users should upgrade to at least
  v0.25.5 to avoid this vulnerability."
