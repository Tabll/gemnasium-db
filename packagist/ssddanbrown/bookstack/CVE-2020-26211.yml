package_slug: "packagist/ssddanbrown/bookstack"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "In BookStack before version 0.30.4, a user with permissions to edit
  a page could insert JavaScript code through the use of `javascript:` URIs within
  a link or form which would run, within the context of the current page, when clicked
  or submitted. Additionally, a user with permissions to edit a page could insert
  a particular meta tag which could be used to silently redirect users to a alternative
  location upon visit of a page. Dangerous content may remain in the database but
  will be removed before being displayed on a page. If you think this could have been
  exploited the linked advisory provides a SQL query to test. As a workaround without
  upgrading, page edit permissions could be limited to only those that are trusted
  until you can upgrade although this will not address existing exploitation of this
  vulnerability. The issue is fixed in BookStack version 0.30.4."
