package_slug: "packagist/ssddanbrown/bookstack"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "In BookStack greater than or equal to 0.18.0 and less than 0.29.2, there
  is an XSS vulnerability in comment creation. A user with permission to create comments
  could POST HTML directly to the system to be saved in a comment, which would then
  be executed/displayed to others users viewing the comment. Through this vulnerability
  custom JavaScript code could be injected and therefore ran on other user machines.
  This most impacts scenarios where not-trusted users are given permission to create
  comments. This has been fixed in 0.29.2."
