title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "knplabs/knp-snappy is a PHP library allowing thumbnail, snapshot or
  PDF generation from a url or a html page.\n## Issue\n\nOn March 17th the vulnerability
  CVE-2023-28115 was disclosed, allowing an attacker to gain remote code execution
  through PHAR deserialization. Version 1.4.2 added a check `if (\\strpos($filename,
  'phar://') === 0)` in the `prepareOutput` function to resolve this CVE, however
  if the user is able to control the second parameter of the `generateFromHtml()`
  function of Snappy, it will then be passed as the `$filename` parameter in the `prepareOutput()`
  function. In the original vulnerability, a file name with a `phar://` wrapper could
  be sent to the `fileExists()` function, equivalent to the `file_exists()` PHP function.
  This allowed users to trigger a deserialization on arbitrary PHAR files. To fix
  this issue, the string is now passed to the `strpos()` function and if it starts
  with `phar://`, an exception is raised. However, PHP wrappers being case insensitive,
  this patch can be bypassed using `PHAR://` instead of `phar://`. A successful exploitation
  of this vulnerability allows executing arbitrary code and accessing the underlying
  filesystem. The attacker must be able to upload a file and the server must be running
  a PHP version prior to 8. This issue has been addressed in commit `d3b742d61a` which
  has been included in version 1.4.3. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to
  upgrade should ensure that only trusted users may submit data to the `AbstractGenerator->generate(...)`
  function.\n"
