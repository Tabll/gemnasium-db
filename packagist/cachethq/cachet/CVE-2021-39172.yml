package_slug: "packagist/cachethq/cachet"
title: "Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')"
description: "Cachet is an open source status page system. Prior to version 2.5.1,
  authenticated users, regardless of their privileges (User or Admin), can exploit
  a new line injection in the configuration edition feature (e.g. mail settings) and
  gain arbitrary code execution on the server. This issue was addressed in version
  2.5.1 by improving `UpdateConfigCommandHandler` and preventing the use of new lines
  characters in new configuration values. As a workaround, only allow trusted source
  IP addresses to access to the administration dashboard."
