title: "YOURLS is vulnerable to XSS through JSONP and Callback request parameters"
description: "The callback and **jsonp** request parameters are directly concatenated
  into the response without any sanitization that allowing attackers to inject arbitrary
  JS code. When **YOURLS_PRIVATE** is set to **false** (public API mode), this vulnerability
  can be exploited by any unauthenticated attacker. In private mode, the XSS payload
  is still injected into the 403 response body though browser execution is blocked."
