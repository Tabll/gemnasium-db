title: "OpenCFP Framework (Sentry) Account takeover via null password reset codes"
description: "OpenCFP, an open-source conference talk submission system written in
  PHP, contains a security vulnerability in its third-party authentication framework,
  Sentry, developed by Cartalyst. The vulnerability stems from how Sentry handles
  password reset checks. Users lacking a password reset token stored in the database
  default to having NULL in the reset_password_code column. Exploiting this flaw could
  allow unauthorized manipulation of any OpenCFP user's password, particularly those
  without an unused password reset token. Although successful login still requires
  correlating the numeric user ID with an email address, the identification of likely
  organizers (users 1-5) may facilitate this process."
