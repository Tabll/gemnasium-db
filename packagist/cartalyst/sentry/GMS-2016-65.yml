title: "Arbitrary password resets via NULL reset codes"
description: "There's a flaw in the DB schema where `reset_password_code` is NULL
  by default. If an attacker is able to provide a NULL reset code to the package,
  there are no guards against arbitrary anonymous password resets. In many cases,
  submitting a url-encoded null byte value (`%00`) will match what's in the database,
  passing the check and allowing the attacker to set the password to what they wish."
