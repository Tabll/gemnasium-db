title: "Prevent injection of invalid entity ids for \"autocomplete\" fields"
description: "### Impact\nUnder certain circumstances, an attacker could successfully
  submit an entity id for an `EntityType` that is *not* part of the valid choices.\n\nAffected
  applications are any that use:\n\n* A custom `query_builder` option to limit the
  valid results;\nAND\n* An `EntityType` with `'autocomplete' => true` or a custom
  [AsEntityAutocompleteField](https://symfony.com/bundles/ux-autocomplete/current/index.html#usage-in-a-form-with-ajax).\n\nUnder
  this circumstance, if an id is submitted, it is accepted even if the matching record
  would not be returned by the custom query built with `query_builder`.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe
  problem has been fixed in `symfony/ux-autocomplete` version 2.11.2.\n\n### Workarounds\nUpgrade
  to version 2.11.2 or greater of `symfony/ux-autocomplete` or perform extra validation
  after submit to verify the selected option is valid.\n"
