identifier: "CVE-2020-15094"
package_slug: "packagist/symfony/form"
title: "In Symfony, the CachingHttpClient class from the HttpClient Symfony component
  relies on the HttpCache class to handle requests. HttpCache uses internal headers
  like `X-Body-Eval` and `X-Body-File` to control the restoration of cached responses.
  The class was initially written with surrogate caching and ESI support in mind (all
  HTTP calls come from a trusted backend in that scenario). But when used by CachingHttpClient
  and if an attacker can control the response for a request being made by the CachingHttpClient,
  remote code execution is possible."
