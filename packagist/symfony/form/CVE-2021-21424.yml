package_slug: "packagist/symfony/form"
title: "Information Exposure"
description: "Symfony is a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set
  of reusable PHP components. The ability to enumerate users was possible without
  relevant permissions due to different handling depending on whether the user existed
  or not when attempting to use the switch users functionality. We now ensure that
  error codes are returned whether the user exists or not if a user cannot switch
  to a user or if the user does not exist."
