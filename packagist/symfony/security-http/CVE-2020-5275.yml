identifier: "CVE-2020-5275"
package_slug: "packagist/symfony/security-http"
title: "Incorrect Authorization"
description: "In symfony/security-http, when a `Firewall` checks access control rule,
  it iterates overs each rule's attributes and stops as soon as the `accessDecisionManager`
  decides to grant access on the attribute, preventing the check of next attributes
  that should have been take into account in a unanimous strategy. The `accessDecisionManager`
  is now called with all attributes at once, allowing the unanimous strategy being
  applied on each attribute."
