package_slug: "packagist/symfony/security-http"
title: "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request Smuggling')"
description: "`Symfony/Http-Kernel` is the HTTP kernel component for Symfony, a PHP
  framework for web and console applications and a set of reusable PHP components.
  Headers that are not part of the `trusted_headers` allowed list are ignored and
  protect users from Cache poisoning attacks. In Symfony, maintainers added support
  for the `X-Forwarded-Prefix` headers, but this header was accessible in SubRequest,
  even if it was not part of the `trusted_headers` allowed list. An attacker could
  leverage this opportunity to forge requests containing a `X-Forwarded-Prefix` header,
  leading to a web cache poisoning issue."
