package_slug: "packagist/symfony/security-http"
title: "Cross-site scripting"
description: "Symfony is a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set
  of reusable PHP components. Starting in versions 2.0.0, 5.0.0, and 6.0.0 and prior
  to versions 4.4.51, 5.4.31, and 6.3.8, some Twig filters in CodeExtension use `is_safe=html`
  but don't actually ensure their input is safe. As of versions 4.4.51, 5.4.31, and
  6.3.8, Symfony now escapes the output of the affected filters."
