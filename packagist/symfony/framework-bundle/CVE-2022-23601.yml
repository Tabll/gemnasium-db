package_slug: "packagist/symfony/framework-bundle"
title: "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
description: "Symfony is a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set
  of reusable PHP components. The Symfony form component provides a CSRF protection
  mechanism by using a random token injected in the form and using the session to
  store and control the token submitted by the user. When using the FrameworkBundle,
  this protection can be enabled or disabled with the configuration. If the configuration
  is not specified, by default, the mechanism is enabled as long as the session is
  enabled. In a recent change in the way the configuration is loaded, the default
  behavior has been dropped and, as a result, the CSRF protection is not enabled in
  form when not explicitly enabled, which makes the application sensible to CSRF attacks.
  This issue has been resolved in the patch versions listed and users are advised
  to update. There are no known workarounds for this issue."
