title: "Session Fixation"
description: "Symfony/SecurityBundle is the security system for Symfony, a PHP framework
  for web and console applications and a set of reusable PHP components. Since the
  rework of the Remember me cookie, the cookie is not invalidated when the user changes
  their password. Attackers can therefore maintain their access to the account even
  if the password is changed as long as they have had the chance to login once and
  get a valid remember me cookie. Starting with, Symfony makes the password part of
  the signature by default. In that way, when the password changes, then the cookie
  is not valid anymore."
