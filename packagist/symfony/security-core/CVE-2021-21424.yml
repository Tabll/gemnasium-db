title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "Symfony is a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set
  of reusable PHP components. The ability to enumerate users was possible without
  relevant permissions due to different handling depending on whether the user existed
  or not when attempting to use the switch users functionality. We now ensure that
  s are returned whether the user exists or not if a user cannot switch to a user
  or if the user does not exist. The patch for this issue is available for branch "
