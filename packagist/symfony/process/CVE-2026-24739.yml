title: "Symfony's incorrect argument escaping under MSYS2/Git Bash can lead to destructive
  file operations on Windows"
description: "The Symfony Process component did not correctly treat some characters
  (notably `=`) as “special” when escaping arguments on Windows. When PHP is executed
  from an MSYS2-based environment (e.g. Git Bash) and Symfony Process spawns native
  Windows executables, MSYS2’s argument/path conversion can mishandle unquoted arguments
  containing these characters.\n\nThis can cause the spawned process to receive corrupted/truncated
  arguments compared to what Symfony intended."
