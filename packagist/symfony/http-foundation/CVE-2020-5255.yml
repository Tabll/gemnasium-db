identifier: "CVE-2020-5255"
package_slug: "packagist/symfony/http-foundation"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "In Symfony, when a `Response` does not contain a `Content-Type` header,
  affected versions of Symfony can fallback to the format defined in the `Accept`
  header of the request, leading to a possible mismatch between the response content
  and `Content-Type` header. When the response is cached, this can prevent the use
  of the website by other users."
