title: "Symfony's incorrect parsing of PATH_INFO can lead to limited authorization
  bypass"
description: "The `Request` class improperly interprets some `PATH_INFO` in a way
  that leads to representing some URLs with a path that doesn't start with a `/`.
  This can allow bypassing some access control rules that are built with this `/`-prefix
  assumption."
