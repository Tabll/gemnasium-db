identifier: "CVE-2020-15094"
package_slug: "packagist/symfony/http-foundation"
title: "Improper Cross-boundary Removal of Sensitive Data"
description: "In Symfony, the CachingHttpClient class from the HttpClient Symfony
  component relies on the HttpCache class to handle requests. HttpCache uses internal
  headers like `X-Body-Eval` and `X-Body-File` to control the restoration of cached
  responses. The class was initially written with surrogate caching and ESI support
  in mind (all HTTP calls come from a trusted backend in that scenario). But when
  used by CachingHttpClient and if an attacker can control the response for a request
  being made by the CachingHttpClient, remote code execution is possible."
