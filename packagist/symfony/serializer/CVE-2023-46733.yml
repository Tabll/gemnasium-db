package_slug: "packagist/symfony/serializer"
title: "Session Fixation"
description: "Symfony is a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set
  of reusable PHP components. Starting in versions 5.4.21 and 6.2.7 and prior to versions
  5.4.31 and 6.3.8, `SessionStrategyListener` does not migrate the session after every
  successful login. It does so only in case the logged in user changes by means of
  checking the user identifier. In some use cases, the user identifier does not change
  between the verification phase and the successful login, while the token itself
  changes from one type (partially-authenticated) to another (fully-authenticated).
  When this happens, the session id should be regenerated to prevent possible session
  fixations, which is not the case at the moment. As of versions 5.4.31 and 6.3.8,
  Symfony now checks the type of the token in addition to the user identifier before
  deciding whether the session id should be regenerated."
