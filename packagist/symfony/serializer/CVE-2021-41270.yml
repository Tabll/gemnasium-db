title: "Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File"
description: "Symfony/Serializer handles serializing and deserializing data structures
  for Symfony, a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set of reusable
  PHP components. Symfony  is vulnerable to CSV injection, also known as formula injection.
  In Symfony, maintainers added the opt-in `csv_escape_formulas` option in the `CsvEncoder`,
  to prefix all cells starting with `=`, `+`, `-` or `@` with a tab `\\t`. Since then,
  OWASP added 2 chars in that list: Tab (0x09) and Carriage return (0x0D). This makes
  the previous prefix char (Tab `\\t`) part of the vulnerable characters, and OWASP
  suggests using the single quote `'` for prefixing the value. Starting with, Symfony
  now follows the OWASP recommendations and uses the single quote `'` to prefix formulas
  and add the prefix to cells starting by `\\t`, `\\r` as well as `=`, `+`, `-` and
  `@`."
