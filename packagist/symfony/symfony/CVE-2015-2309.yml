identifier: "CVE-2015-2309"
package_slug: "packagist/symfony/symfony"
title: "Unsafe methods in the Request class"
description: "The `Symfony\\Component\\HttpFoundation\\Request` class provides a mechanism
  that ensures it does not trust HTTP header values coming from a \"non-trusted\"
  client. Unfortunately, it assumes that the remote address is always a trusted client
  if at least one trusted proxy is involved in the request; this allows a man-in-the-middle
  attack between the latest trusted proxy and the web server. The following methods
  are impacted: `getPort()`, `isSecure()`, `getHost()` and `getClientIps()`."
