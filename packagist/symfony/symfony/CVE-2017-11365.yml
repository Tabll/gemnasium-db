package_slug: "packagist/symfony/symfony"
title: "Empty passwords validation issue"
description: "Validating a user password with a `UserPassword` constraint but with
  no `NotBlank` constraint passes without any error (the empty password would not
  be compared with the user password). Note that you should always be explicit and
  add a `NotBlank` constraint, but as it worked before without, it's considered as
  a backward compatibility break and a security issue."
