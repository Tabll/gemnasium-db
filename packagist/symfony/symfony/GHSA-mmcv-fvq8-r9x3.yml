description: "The XMLEncoder component of Symfony 2.0.x fails to disable external
  entities when parsing XML. In the Symfony2 framework the XML class may be used to
  deserialize objects or as part of a client/server API. By using external entities
  it is possible to include arbitrary files from the file system."
