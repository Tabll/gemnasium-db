title: "Symfony storing cookie headers in HttpCache"
description: "Description\n-----------\n\nThe Symfony HTTP cache system acts as a
  reverse proxy: it caches HTTP responses (including headers) and returns them to
  clients.\n\nIn a recent `AbstractSessionListener` change, the response might now
  contain a `Set-Cookie` header. If the Symfony HTTP cache system is enabled, this
  header might be stored and returned to some other clients. An attacker can use this
  vulnerability to retrieve the victim's session.\n\nResolution\n----------\n\nThe
  `HttpStore` constructor now takes a parameter containing a list of private headers
  that are removed from the HTTP response headers.\nThe default value for this parameter
  is `Set-Cookie`, but it can be overridden or extended by the application.\n\nThe
  patch for this issue is available [here](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/d2f6322af9444ac5cd1ef3ac6f280dbef7f9d1fb)
  for branch 4.4.\n\nCredits\n-------\n\nWe would like to thank Soner Sayakci for
  reporting the issue and Nicolas Grekas for fixing it."
