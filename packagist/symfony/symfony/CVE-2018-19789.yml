identifier: "CVE-2018-19789"
package_slug: "packagist/symfony/symfony"
title: "Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type"
description: "When using the scalar type hint `string` in a setter method (e.g. `setName(string$name)`)
  of a class that's the `data_class` of a form, and when a file upload is submitted
  to the corresponding field instead of a normal text input, then `UploadedFile::__toString()`
  is called which will then return and disclose the path of the uploaded file. If
  combined with a local file inclusion issue in certain circumstances this could escalate
  it to a Remote Code Execution."
