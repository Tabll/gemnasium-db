identifier: "CVE-2018-19789"
package_slug: "packagist/symfony/symfony"
title: "Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type"
description: "When using the scalar type hint `string` in a setter method (e.g.
  `setName(string$name)`) of a class that's the `data_class` of a form, and
  when a file upload is submitted to the corresponding field instead of a
  normal text input, then `UploadedFile::__toString()` is called which will
  then return and disclose the path of the uploaded file. If combined with a
  local file inclusion issue in certain circumstances this could escalate it to
  a Remote Code Execution."
