title: "Symfony vulnerable to Session Fixation of CSRF tokens"
description: "Description\n-----------\n\nWhen authenticating users Symfony by default
  regenerates the session ID upon login, but preserves the rest of session attributes.
  Because this does not clear CSRF tokens upon login, this might enables [same-site
  attackers](https://canitakeyoursubdomain.name/) to bypass the CSRF protection mechanism
  by performing an attack similar to a session-fixation.\n\nResolution\n----------\n\nSymfony
  removes all CSRF tokens from the session on successful login.\n\nThe patch for this
  issue is available [here](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/5909d74ecee359ea4982fcf4331aaf2e489a1fd4)
  for branch 4.4.\n\nCredits\n-------\n\nWe would like to thank Marco Squarcina for
  reporting the issue and Nicolas Grekas for fixing it."
