title: "Session Fixation"
description: "Symfony is a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set
  of reusable PHP components. When authenticating users Symfony by default regenerates
  the session ID upon login, but preserves the rest of session attributes. Because
  this does not clear CSRF tokens upon login, this might enables same-site attackers
  to bypass the CSRF protection mechanism by performing an attack similar to a session-fixation.
  This issue has been fixed in the 4.4 branch."
