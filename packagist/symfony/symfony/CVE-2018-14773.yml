identifier: "CVE-2018-14773"
package_slug: "packagist/symfony/symfony"
title: "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request Smuggling')"
description: "An issue was discovered in Http Foundation in Symfony. It arises from
  support for a (legacy) IIS header that lets users override the path in the request
  URL via the `X-Original-URL` or `X-Rewrite-URL` HTTP request header. These headers
  are designed for IIS support, but it's not verified that the server is in fact running
  IIS, which means anybody who can send these requests to an application can trigger
  this. This affects `\\Symfony\\Component\\HttpFoundation\\Request::prepareRequestUri()`
  where `X-Original-URL` and `X_REWRITE_URL` are both used."
