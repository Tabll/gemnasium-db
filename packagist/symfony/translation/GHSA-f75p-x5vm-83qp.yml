title: "symfony/translation XML Entity Expansion vulnerability"
description: "Symfony 2.0.11 carried a [similar] XXE security fix, however, on review
  of ZF2 I also noted a vulnerability to XML Entity Expansion (XEE) attacks whereby
  all extensions making use of libxml2 have no defense against XEE Quadratic Blowup
  Attacks. The vulnerability is a function of there being no current method of disabling
  custom entities in PHP (i.e. defined internal to the XML document without using
  external entities). In a QBA, a long entity can be defined and then referred to
  multiple times in document elements, creating a memory sink with which Denial Of
  Service attacks against a host's RAM can be mounted. The use of the LIBXML_NOENT
  or equivalent option in a dependent extension amplified the impact (it doesn't actually
  mean \"No Entities\"). In addition, libxml2's innate defense against the related
  Exponential or Billion Laugh's XEE attacks is active only so long as the LIBXML_PARSEHUGE
  is NOT set (it disables libxml2's hardcoded entity recursion limit). No instances
  of these two options were noted, but it's worth referencing for the future."
