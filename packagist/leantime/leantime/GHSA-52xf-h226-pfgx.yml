title: "Leantime allows Refelected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
description: "The vulnerability in Leantime's \"overdue\" section allows attackers
  to upload malicious image files containing XSS payloads. When other users view these
  files, the scripts execute, enabling attackers to steal sensitive information or
  perform unauthorized actions. Improving input validation and output encoding in
  the file upload process can prevent this exploit. Accessing and enhancing the relevant
  source code modules is crucial for addressing this security flaw effectively."
