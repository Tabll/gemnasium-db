title: "Leantime allows Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection (SQLi)"
description: "A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in Leantime.
  The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into certain fields,
  potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary code or unauthorized access to
  user-sensitive information. The code does not include any validation or sanitization
  of the $_GET[\"id\"] parameter. As a result, it directly incorporates the user-supplied
  value into the source path without any checks."
