identifier: "CVE-2021-29504"
package_slug: "packagist/wp-cli/wp-cli"
title: "Improper Certificate Validation"
description: "WP-CLI is the command-line interface for WordPress. An improper error
  handling in HTTPS requests management in WP-CLI allows remote attackers able to
  intercept the communication to remotely disable the certificate verification on
  WP-CLI side, gaining full control over the communication content, including the
  ability to impersonate update servers and push malicious updates towards WordPress
  instances controlled by the vulnerable WP-CLI agent, or push malicious updates toward
  WP-CLI itself. The vulnerability stems from the fact that the default behavior of
  `WP_CLI\\Utils\\http_request()` when encountering a TLS handshake error is to disable
  certificate validation and retry the same request."
