title: "Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information"
description: "In Sulu before versions 1.6.35, 2.0.10, and 2.1.1, when the \"Forget
  password\" feature on the login screen is used, Sulu asks the user for a username
  or email address. If the given string is not found, a response with a `400` error
  code is returned, along with a error message saying that this user name does not
  exist. This enables attackers to retrieve valid usernames. Also, the response of
  the \"Forgot Password\" request returns the email address to which the email was
  sent, if the operation was successful. This information should not be exposed, as
  it can be used to gather email addresses. This problem was fixed in versions 1.6.35,
  2.0.10 and 2.1.1."
