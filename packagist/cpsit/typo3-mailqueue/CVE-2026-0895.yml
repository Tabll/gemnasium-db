package_slug: "packagist/cpsit/typo3-mailqueue"
title: "mailqueue TYPO3 extension affected by Insecure Deserialization in QueueableFileTransport"
description: "The extension extends TYPO3’s FileSpool component, which was vulnerable
  to Insecure Deserialization prior to [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2026-004](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2026-004).
  Since the related fix is overwritten by the extension, using the extension with
  a patched TYPO3 core version still allows for Insecure Deserialization, because
  the affected vulnerable code was extracted from TYPO3 core to the extension.\n\nMore
  information about this vulnerability can be found in the related TYPO3 Core Security
  Advisory [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2026-004](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2026-004)."
