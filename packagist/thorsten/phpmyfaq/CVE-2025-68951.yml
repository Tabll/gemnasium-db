title: "phpMyFAQ has Stored XSS in user list via admin-managed display_name"
description: "A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability allows an attacker
  to execute arbitrary JavaScript in an administrator’s browser by registering a user
  whose **display name** contains HTML entities (e.g., `&lt;img ...&gt;`). When an
  administrator views the admin user list, the payload is decoded server-side and
  rendered without escaping, resulting in script execution in the admin context."
