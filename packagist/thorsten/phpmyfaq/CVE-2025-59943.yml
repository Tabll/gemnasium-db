package_slug: "packagist/thorsten/phpmyfaq"
title: "phpMyFAQ duplicate email registration allows multiple accounts with the same
  email"
description: "phpMyFAQ does not enforce uniqueness of email addresses during user
  registration. This allows multiple distinct accounts to be created with the same
  email. Because email is often used as an identifier for password resets, notifications,
  and administrative actions, this flaw can cause account ambiguity and, in certain
  configurations, may lead to privilege escalation or account takeover."
