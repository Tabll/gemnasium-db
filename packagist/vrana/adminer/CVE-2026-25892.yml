title: "Adminer has an Unauthenticated Persistent DoS via Array Injection in ?script=version
  Endpoint"
description: "Adminer v5.4.1 has a version check mechanism where `adminer.org` sends
  signed version info via JavaScript postMessage, which the browser then POSTs to
  `?script=version`. This endpoint lacks origin validation and accepts POST data from
  any source. An attacker can POST `version[]` parameter which PHP converts to an
  array. On next page load, `openssl_verify()` receives this array instead of string
  and throws `TypeError`, returning HTTP 500 to all users."
