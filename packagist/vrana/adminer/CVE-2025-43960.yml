title: "Adminer PHP Object Injection issue leads to Denial of Service"
description: "Adminer 4.8.1, when using Monolog for logging, allows a Denial of Service
  (memory consumption) via a crafted serialized payload (e.g., using s:1000000000),
  leading to a PHP Object Injection issue. Remote, unauthenticated attackers can trigger
  this by sending a malicious serialized object, which forces excessive memory usage,
  rendering Adminerâ€™s interface unresponsive and causing a server-level DoS. While
  the server may recover after several minutes, multiple simultaneous requests can
  cause a complete crash requiring manual intervention."
