title: "codeigniter/framework SQL injection in ODBC database driver"
description: "CodeIgniter 3.1.0 addressed a critical security issue within the ODBC
  database driver. This update includes crucial fixes to mitigate a SQL injection
  vulnerability, preventing potential exploitation by attackers. It is noteworthy
  that these fixes render the query builder and escape() functions incompatible with
  the ODBC driver. However, the update introduces actual query binding as a more secure
  alternative."
