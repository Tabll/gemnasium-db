title: "EGroupware has SQL Injection in Nextmatch Filter Processing"
description: "**Critical Authenticated SQL Injection in Nextmatch Widget Filter Processing**\n\nA
  critical SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the core components of EGroupware,
  specifically in the `Nextmatch` filter processing. The flaw allows authenticated
  attackers to inject arbitrary SQL commands into the `WHERE` clause of database queries.
  This is achieved by exploiting a PHP type juggling issue where JSON decoding converts
  numeric strings into integers, bypassing the `is_int()` security check used by the
  application."
