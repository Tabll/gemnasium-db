title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "Winter is a free, open-source content management system. Prior to 1.2.4,
  users with the `media.manage_media` permission can upload files to the Media Manager
  and rename them after uploading. Previously, media manager files were only sanitized
  on upload, not on renaming, which could have allowed a stored XSS attack. This issue
  has been patched in v1.2.4."
