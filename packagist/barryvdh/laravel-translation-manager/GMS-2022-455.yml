title: "Possibility for Denial of Service by overwriting PHP files with language exports"
description: "### Impact\nLaravel Translation Manager didn't check the locale name,
  which allowed directory traversal when exporting files. The content would be a PHP
  file returning an array of translations, but this could lead to unexpected results,
  like denial of service. Access to the Laravel Translation Manager is required, because
  a new locale would have to be added and published.\n\n### Patches\nVersion 0.6.2
  fixes this issue.\n\n### Workarounds\nOnly allow trusted admins to publish/edit
  translations.\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-translation-manager/pull/417\n\n###
