package_slug: "packagist/psy/psysh"
title: "PsySH has Local Privilege Escalation via CWD .psysh.php auto-load"
description: "PsySH automatically loads and executes a `.psysh.php` file from the
  Current Working Directory (CWD) on startup. If an attacker can write to a directory
  that a victim later uses as their CWD when launching PsySH, the attacker can trigger
  arbitrary code execution in the victim's context. When the victim runs PsySH with
  elevated privileges (e.g., root), this results in local privilege escalation."
