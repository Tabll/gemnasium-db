title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "laminas-diactoros is a PHP package containing implementations of the
  PSR-7 HTTP message interfaces and PSR-17 HTTP message factory interfaces. Applications
  that use Diactoros, and are either not behind a proxy, or can be accessed via untrusted
  proxies, can potentially have the host, protocol, and/or port of a `Laminas\\Diactoros\\Uri`
  instance associated with the incoming server request modified to reflect values
  from `X-Forwarded-*` headers. Such changes can potentially lead to XSS attacks (if
  a fully-qualified URL is used in links) and/or URL poisoning. Since the `X-Forwarded-*`
  headers do have valid use cases, particularly in clustered environments using a
  load balancer, the library offers mitigation measures only in the v2 releases, as
  doing otherwise would break these use cases immediately. Users of v2 releases from
  2.11.1 can provide an additional argument to `Laminas\\Diactoros\\ServerRequestFactory::fromGlobals()`
  in the form of a `Laminas\\Diactoros\\RequestFilter\\RequestFilterInterface` instance,
  including the shipped `Laminas\\Diactoros\\RequestFilter\\NoOpRequestFilter` implementation
  which ignores the `X-Forwarded-*` headers. Starting in version 3.0, the library
  will reverse behavior to use the `NoOpRequestFilter` by default, and require users
  to opt-in to `X-Forwarded-*` header usage via a configured `Laminas\\Diactoros\\RequestFilter\\LegacyXForwardedHeaderFilter`
  instance. Users are advised to upgrade to version 2.11.1 or later to resolve this
  issue. Users unable to upgrade may configure web servers to reject `X-Forwarded-*`
  headers at the web server level."
