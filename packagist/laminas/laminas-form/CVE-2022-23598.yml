title: "Reflected XSS vulnerability when rendering error messages in laminas-form"
description: "laminas-form is a package for validating and displaying simple and complex
  forms. When rendering validation error messages via the `formElementErrors()` view
  helper shipped with laminas-form, many messages will contain the submitted value.
  However, in laminas-form, the value was not being escaped for HTML contexts, which
  could potentially lead to a reflected cross-site scripting attack. contain a patch
  to mitigate the vulnerability. A workaround is available. One may manually place
  code at the top of a view script where one calls the `formElementErrors()` view
  helper."
