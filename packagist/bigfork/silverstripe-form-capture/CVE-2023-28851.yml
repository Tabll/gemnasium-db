title: "Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)"
description: "Silverstripe Form Capture provides a method to capture simple silverstripe
  forms and an admin interface for users. Starting in version 0.2.0 and prior to versions
  1.0.2, 1.1.0, 2.2.5, and 3.1.1, improper escaping when presenting stored form submissions
  allowed for an attacker to perform a Cross-Site Scripting attack. The vulnerability
  was initially patched in version 1.0.2, and version 1.1.0 includes this patch. The
  bug was then accidentally re-introduced during a merge error, and has been re-patched
  in versions 2.2.5 and 3.1.1. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
