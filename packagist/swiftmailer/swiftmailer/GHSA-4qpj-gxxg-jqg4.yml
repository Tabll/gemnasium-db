title: "Swiftmailer Sendmail transport arbitrary shell execution"
description: "Prior to 5.2.1, the sendmail transport (`Swift_Transport_SendmailTransport`)
  was vulnerable to an arbitrary shell execution if the \"From\" header came from
  a non-trusted source and no \"Return-Path\" is configured. This has been fixed in
  5.2.1. If you are using sendmail as a transport, you are encouraged to upgrade as
  soon as possible."
