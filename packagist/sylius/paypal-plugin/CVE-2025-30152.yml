title: "Sylius PayPal Plugin has an Order Manipulation Vulnerability after PayPal
  Checkout"
description: "A discovered vulnerability allows users to modify their shopping cart
  after completing the PayPal Checkout process and payment authorization. If a user
  initiates a PayPal transaction from a product page or the cart page and then returns
  to the order summary page, they can still manipulate the cart contents before finalizing
  the order. As a result, the order amount in Sylius may be higher than the amount
  actually captured by PayPal, leading to a scenario where merchants deliver products
  or services without full payment."
