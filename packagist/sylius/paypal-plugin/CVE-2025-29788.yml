title: "Sylius PayPal Plugin Payment Amount Manipulation Vulnerability"
description: "A vulnerability allows users to manipulate the final payment amount
  processed by PayPal. If a user modifies the item quantity in their shopping cart
  after initiating the PayPal Checkout process, PayPal will not receive the updated
  total amount. As a result, PayPal captures only the initially transmitted amount,
  while Sylius incorrectly considers the order fully paid based on the modified total.
  This flaw can be exploited both accidentally and intentionally, potentially enabling
  fraud by allowing customers to pay less than the actual order value."
