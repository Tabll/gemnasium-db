identifier: "CVE-2020-5218"
package_slug: "packagist/sylius/sylius"
title: "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests (HTTP Request Smuggling)"
description: "Affected versions of Sylius give attackers the ability to switch channels
  via the `_channel_code` GET parameter in production environments. This was meant
  to be enabled only when kernel.debug is set to `true`. However, if no `sylius_channel.debug`
  is set explicitly in the configuration, the default value which is kernel.debug
  will be not resolved and cast to boolean, enabling this debug feature even if that
  parameter is set to `false`."
