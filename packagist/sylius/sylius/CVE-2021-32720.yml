identifier: "CVE-2021-32720"
package_slug: "packagist/sylius/sylius"
title: "Information Exposure"
description: "Sylius is an Open Source eCommerce platform on top of Symfony. An issue
  was found in Sylius, where part of the details (order ID, order number, items total,
  and token value) of all placed orders are exposed to unauthorized users. If exploited
  properly, a few additional information like the number of items in the cart and
  the date of the shipping may be fetched as well. This data seems to not be crucial
  nor is personal data, however, could be used for sociotechnical attacks or may expose
  a few details about shop condition to the third parties. The data possible to aggregate
  are the number of processed orders or their value in the moment of time. There are
  a few workarounds for the vulnerability. The first possible solution is to hide
  the problematic endpoints behind the firewall from not logged in users. This would
  put only the order list under the firewall and allow only authorized users to access
  it. Once a user is authorized, it will have access to theirs orders only. The second
  possible solution is to decorate the `\\Sylius\\Bundle\\ApiBundle\\Doctrine\\QueryCollectionExtension\\OrdersByLoggedInUserExtension`
  and throw `Symfony\\Component\\Security\\Core\\Exception\\AccessDeniedException`
  if the class is executed for unauthorized user."
