package_slug: "packagist/sylius/sylius"
title: "Insufficient Session Expiration"
description: "Sylius is an open source eCommerce platform. Prior to versions 1.10.11
  and 1.11.2, the reset password token was not set to null after the password was
  changed. The same token could be used several times, which could result in leak
  of the existing token and unauthorized password change. The issue is fixed in versions
  1.10.11 and 1.11.2. As a workaround, overwrite the `Sylius\\Bundle\\ApiBundle\\CommandHandler\\ResetPasswordHandler`
  class with code provided by the maintainers and register it in a container. More
  information about this workaround is available in the GitHub Security Advisory."
