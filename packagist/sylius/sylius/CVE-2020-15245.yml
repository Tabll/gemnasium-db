package_slug: "packagist/sylius/sylius"
title: "Cross-site Scripting"
description: "In Sylius, the user may register in a shop by email `mail@example.com`,
  verify it, change it to the mail `another@domain.com` and stay verified and enabled.
  This may lead to having accounts addressed to totally different emails, that were
  verified. Note, that this way one is not able to take over any existing account
  (guest or normal one). The issue has been patched in Sylius As a workaround, you
  may resolve this issue on your own by creating a custom event listener, which will
  listen to the `sylius.customer.pre_update` event. You can determine that email has
  been changed if customer email and user username are different. They are synchronized
  later on. Pay attention, to email changing behavior for administrators. You may
  need to skip this logic for them. In order to achieve this, you should either check
  master request path info, if it does not contain `/admin` prefix or adjust event
  triggered during customer update in the shop. You can find more information on how
  to customize the event here."
