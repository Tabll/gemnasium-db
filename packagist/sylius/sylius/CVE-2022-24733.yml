package_slug: "packagist/sylius/sylius"
title: "Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames"
description: "Sylius is an open source eCommerce platform. Prior to versions 1.9.10,
  1.10.11, and 1.11.2, it is possible for a page controlled by an attacker to load
  the website within an iframe. This will enable a clickjacking attack, in which the
  attacker's page overlays the target application's interface with a different interface
  provided by the attacker. The issue is fixed in versions 1.9.10, 1.10.11, and 1.11.2.
  A workaround is available. Every response from app should have an X-Frame-Options
  header set to: ``sameorigin``. To achieve that, add a new `subscriber` in the app."
