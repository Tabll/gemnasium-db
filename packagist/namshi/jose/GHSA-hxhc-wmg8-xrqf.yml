title: "namshi/jose insecure JSON Web Signatures (JWS)"
description: "namshi/jose allows the acceptance of unsecure JSON Web Signatures (JWS)
  by default. The vulnerability arises from the $allowUnsecure flag, which, when set
  to true during the loading of JWSes, permits tokens signed with 'none' algorithms
  to be processed. This behavior poses a significant security risk as it could allow
  an attacker to impersonate users by crafting a valid jwt token."
