title: "Interpretation Conflict"
description: "guzzlehttp/psr7 is a PSR-7 HTTP message library implementation in PHP.
  Affected versions are subject to improper header parsing. An attacker could sneak
  in a newline (\\n) into both the header names and values. While the specification
  states that \\r\\n\\r\\n is used to terminate the header list, many servers in the
  wild will also accept \\n\\n. This is a follow-up to CVE-2022-24775 where the fix
  was incomplete. The issue has been patched in versions 1.9.1 and 2.4.5. There are
  no known workarounds for this vulnerability. Users are advised to upgrade."
