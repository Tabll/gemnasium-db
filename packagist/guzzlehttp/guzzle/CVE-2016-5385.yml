identifier: "CVE-2016-5385"
package_slug: "packagist/guzzlehttp/guzzle"
title: "Vulnerability in CGI applications"
description: "httpoxy is a set of vulnerabilities that affect application code running
  in CGI, or CGI-like environments. It comes down to a simple namespace conflict:
  RFC (CGI) puts the HTTP Proxy header from a request into the environment variables
  as `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTP_PROXY` is a popular environment variable used to configure
  an outgoing proxy. This leads to a remotely exploitable vulnerability."
