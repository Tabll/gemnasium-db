title: "Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')"
description: "Grav is a flat-file content management system. Prior to version 1.7.42,
  the patch for CVE-2022-2073, a server-side template injection vulnerability in Grav
  leveraging the default `filter()` function, does not block other built-in functions
  exposed by Twig's Core Extension that could be used to invoke arbitrary unsafe functions,
  thereby allowing for remote code execution. A patch in version 1.74.2 overrides
  the built-in Twig `map()` and `reduce()` filter functions in `system/src/Grav/Common/Twig/Extension/GravExtension.php`
  to validate the argument passed to the filter in `$arrow`."
