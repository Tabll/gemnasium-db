description: "A low privilege user account with page edit privilege can read any server
  files using Twig Syntax. This includes Grav user account files - /grav/user/accounts/*.yaml.
  This file stores hashed user password, 2FA secret, and the password reset token.
  This can allow an adversary to compromise any registered account by resetting a
  password for a user to get access to the password reset token from the file or by
  cracking the hashed password."
