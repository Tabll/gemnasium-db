title: "Grav vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in Grav Admin: Missing Username Uniqueness
  Check Allows Admin Account Takeover"
description: "A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in Grav’s Admin plugin due
  to the absence of username uniqueness validation when creating users.\nA user with
  the create user permission can create a new account using the same username as an
  existing administrator account, set a new password/email, and then log in as that
  administrator. This effectively allows privilege escalation from limited user-manager
  permissions to full administrator access."
