title: "Grav vulnerable to Path Traversal allowing server files backup"
description: "```\nA path traversal vulnerability has been identified in Grav CMS,
  versions 1.7.49.5 , allowing authenticated attackers\nwith administrative privileges
  to read arbitrary files on the underlying server filesystem. This vulnerability
  arises due\nto insufficient input sanitization in the backup tool, where user-supplied
  paths are not properly restricted, enabling\naccess to files outside the intended
  webroot directory. The impact of this vulnerability depends on the privileges of\nthe
  user account running the application.\n```"
