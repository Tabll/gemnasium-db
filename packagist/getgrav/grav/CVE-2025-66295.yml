title: "Grav vulnerable to Path traversal / arbitrary YAML write via user creation
  leading to Account Takeover / System Corruption"
description: "When a user with privilege of user creation creates a new user through
  the Admin UI and supplies a username containing path traversal sequences (for example
  ..\\Nijat or ../Nijat), Grav writes the account YAML file to an unintended path
  outside user/accounts/. The written YAML can contain account fields such as email,
  fullname, twofa_secret, and hashed_password. In my tests,  I was able to cause the
  Admin UI to write the following content into arbitrary .yaml files (including files
  like email.yaml, system.yaml, or other site YAML files like admin.yaml) — demonstrating
  arbitrary YAML write / overwrite via the Admin UI.\n\nExample observed content written
  by the Admin UI (test data):\nusername: ..\\Nijat\nstate: enabled\nemail: [EMAIL@gmail.com](mailto:EMAIL@gmail.com)\nfullname:
  'Nijat Alizada'\nlanguage: en\ncontent_editor: default\ntwofa_enabled: false\ntwofa_secret:
