identifier: "CVE-2019-13024"
package_slug: "packagist/centreon/centreon"
title: "Command Injection"
description: "Centreon allows the attacker to execute arbitrary system commands by
  using the value \"init_script\"-\"Monitoring Engine Binary\" in `main.get.php` to
  insert a arbitrary command into the database, and execute it by calling the vulnerable
  page `www/include/configuration/configGenerate/xml/generateFiles.php` (which passes
  the inserted value to the database to `shell_exec` without sanitizing it, allowing
  one to execute system arbitrary commands)."
