title: "httpoxy vulnerability"
description: "`humbug_get_contents ` is affected by httpoxy, a set of vulnerabilities
  that affect application code running in CGI, or CGI-like environments. If a vulnerable
  HTTP client makes an outgoing HTTP connection, while running in a server-side CGI
  application, an attacker may be able to: * Proxy the outgoing HTTP requests made
  by the web application * Direct the server to open outgoing connections to an address
  and port of their choosing * Tie up server resources by forcing the vulnerable software
  to use a malicious proxy "
