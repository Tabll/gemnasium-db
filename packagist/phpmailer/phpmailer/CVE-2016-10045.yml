package_slug: "packagist/phpmailer/phpmailer"
title: "Remote code execution in PHPMailer"
description: "The `isMail` transport in PHPMailer before 5.2.20 might allow remote
  attackers to pass extra parameters to the `mail` command and consequently execute
  arbitrary code by leveraging improper interaction between the `escapeshellarg` function
  and internal escaping performed in the mail function in PHP. NOTE: this vulnerability
  exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2016-10033.\n\nThis issue really emphasises
  that it&#39;s worth avoiding the built-in PHP `mail()` function entirely."
