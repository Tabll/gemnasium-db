description: "The patch for CVE-2016-10033 vulnerability added in PHPMailer sanitizes
  the `$Sender` variable by applying `escapeshellarg()` escaping before the value
  is passed to `mail()` function. It does not however take into account the clashing
  of the `escapeshellarg()` function with internal escaping with `escapeshellcmd()`
  performed by `mail()` function on the 5th parameter. As a result it is possible
  to inject an extra quote that does not get properly escaped and break out of the
  `escapeshellarg()` protection applied by the patch in PHPMailer "
