package_slug: "packagist/phpmailer/phpmailer"
title: "Local File Disclosure"
description: "PHPMailer's `msgHTML` method applies transformations to an HTML document
  to make it usable as an email message body. One of the transformations is to convert
  relative image URLs into attachments using a script-provided base directory. If
  no base directory is provided, it resolves to `/`, meaning that relative image URLs
  get treated as absolute local file paths and added as attachments."
