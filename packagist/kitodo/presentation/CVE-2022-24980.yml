title: "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
description: "An issue was discovered in the Kitodo.Presentation (aka dif) extension
  before 2.3.2, 3.x before 3.2.3, and 3.3.x before 3.3.4 for TYPO3. A missing access
  check in an eID script allows an unauthenticated user to submit arbitrary URLs to
  this component. This results in SSRF, allowing attackers to view the content of
  any file or webpage the webserver has access to."
