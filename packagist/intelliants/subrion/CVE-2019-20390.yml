title: "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
description: "A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability was discovered in
  Subrion that allows a remote attacker to remove files on the server without a victim's
  knowledge, by enticing an authenticated user to visit an attacker's web page. The
  application fails to validate the CSRF token for a GET request. An attacker can
  craft a `panel/uploads/read.json?cmd=rm` URL (removing this token) and send it to
  the victim."
