title: "Twig Path Traversal vulnerability in the filesystem loader"
description: "Twig is affected by path traversal vulnerability when used with Twig_Loader_Filesystem
  for loading Twig templates but only if the application is using non-trusted template
  names (names provided by a end-user for instance).\n\nWhen affected, it is possible
  to go up one directory for the paths configured in the application's loader.\n\nFor
  instance, if the filesystem loader is configured with /path/to/templates as a path
  to look for templates, an attacker can force Twig to include a file stored in /path/to
  by prepending the path with /../ like in {% include \"/../somefile_in_path_to\"
  %}\n\nNote that using anything else (like ../somefile, /../../somefile, or ../../somefile)
  wonâ€™t work and the application will return a proper exception."
