title: "Mantis Bug Tracker (MantisBT) allows user account takeover in the signup/reset
  password process"
description: "Insufficient access control in the registration and password reset process
  allows an attacker to reset another user's password and takeover their account,
  if the victim has an incomplete request pending.\n\nThe exploit is only possible
  while the verification token is valid, i.e for 5 minutes after the confirmation
  URL sent by e-mail has been opened, and the user did not complete the process by
  updating their password.\n\nA brute-force attack calling account_update.php with
  increasing user IDs is possible."
