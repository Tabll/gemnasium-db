title: "MantisBT Missing Authorization access check in bug_actiongroup.php"
description: "An issue was discovered in MantisBT before 2.24.4. A missing access
  check in bug_actiongroup.php allows an attacker (with rights to create new issues)
  to use the COPY group action to create a clone, including all bugnotes and attachments,
  of any private issue (i.e., one having Private view status, or belonging to a private
  Project) via the bug_arr[] parameter. This provides full access to potentially confidential
  information."
