title: "LavaLite CMS affected by a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability"
description: "LavaLite CMS versions up to and including 10.1.0 contain a stored cross-site
  scripting vulnerability in the package creation and search functionality. Authenticated
  users can supply crafted HTML or JavaScript in the package Name or Description fields
  that is stored and later rendered without proper output encoding in package search
  results. When other users view search results that include the malicious package,
  the injected script executes in their browsers, potentially enabling session hijacking,
  credential theft, and unauthorized actions in the context of the victim."
