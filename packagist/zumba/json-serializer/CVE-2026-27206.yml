title: "Zumba Json Serializer has a potential PHP Object Injection via Unrestricted
  @type in unserialize()"
description: "The `zumba/json-serializer` library allows deserialization of PHP objects
  from JSON using a special `@type` field.\n\nPrior to version 3.2.3, the deserializer
  would instantiate any class specified in the `@type` field without restriction.
  When processing untrusted JSON input, this behavior may allow an attacker to instantiate
  arbitrary classes available in the application.\n\nIf a vulnerable application passes
  attacker-controlled JSON into JsonSerializer::unserialize() and contains classes
  with dangerous magic methods (such as `__wakeup()` or `__destruct()`), this may
  lead to PHP Object Injection and potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE), depending
  on available gadget chains in the application or its dependencies.\n\nThis behavior
  is similar in risk profile to PHP's native `unserialize()` when used without the
  `allowed_classes` restriction."
