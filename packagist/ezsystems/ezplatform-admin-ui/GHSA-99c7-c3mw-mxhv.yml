title: "ezsystems/ezplatform-admin-ui has an XSS vulnerability in Cancel/Reschedule
  future publication modal"
description: "This security advisory resolves an XSS vulnerability in image asset
  names, content language names and future publishing in the back office of the DXP.
  Back office access and varying levels of editing and management permissions are
  required to exploit this vulnerability. This typically means Editor or Administrator
  role, or similar. Injected XSS is persistent and may in some cases be reflected
  in the front office, possibly affecting end users. The fixes ensure XSS is escaped,
  and any existing injected XSS is rendered harmless."
