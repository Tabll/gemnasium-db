package_slug: "packagist/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel"
title: "Access control issue in ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel"
description: "Access control based on object state is mishandled. This is a policy
  you can use in your roles to limit access to content based on specific object state
  values. Due to a flawed earlier update, these limitations were ineffective in releases
  made since February 16th 2022. They would grant access to the given content regardless
  of the object state. Depending on how your frontent is designed, knowing the URL
  to the content may or may not be required to access it. If you are using object
  state limitations in your roles, this issue is critical. Please apply the fix as
  soon as possible."
