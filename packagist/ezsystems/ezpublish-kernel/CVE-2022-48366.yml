title: "Timing attack in eZ Platform Ibexa"
description: "Ibexa DXP is using random execution time to hinder timing attacks against
  user accounts, a method of discovering whether a given account exists in a system
  without knowing its password, thus affecting privacy. This implementation was found
  to not be good enough in some situations. The fix replaces this with constant time
  functionality, configured in the new security.yml parameter 'ibexa.security.authentication.constant_auth_time'.
  It will log a warning if the constant time is exceeded. If this happens the setting
  should be increased."
