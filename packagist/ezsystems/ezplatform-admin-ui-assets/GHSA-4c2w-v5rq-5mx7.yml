title: "eZ Platform Editor Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"
description: "This Security Advisory is about two issues of low to medium severity.
  We recommend that you install the update as soon as possible.\n\n\nThere is an XSS
  vulnerability in CKEditor, which is used by AlloyEditor, which is used in eZ Platform
  Admin UI. Scripts can be injected through specially crafted \"protected\" comments.
  We are not sure it is exploitable in eZ Platform, but recommend installing it to
  be on the safe side. It is fixed in CKEditor v4.14, AlloyEditor v2.11.9. It is distributed
  via Composer, for:\n\neZ Platform v1.13.x: ezsystems/PlatformUIAssetsBundle v4.2.3
  (included from ezsystems/PlatformUIBundle v1.13.x)\neZ Platform v2.5.13: ezsystems/ezplatform-admin-ui-assets
  v4.2.1\neZ Platform v3.0.*: ezsystems/ezplatform-admin-ui-assets v5.0.1\neZ Platform
  v3.1.2: ezsystems/ezplatform-admin-ui-assets v5.1.1\n\n\nDrafts that are sent to
  trash become visible in the Review Queue, even for users that were not able to see
  them before this action. It's not possible to preview them, but their title and
  review history is displayed. This affects Enterprise Edition only, of which ezplatform-workflow
  is a part. This security update is distributed via Composer, for\n\neZ Platform
  EE v2.5.13: ezsystems/ezplatform-workflow v1.1.9\neZ Platform EE v3.1.2: ezsystems/ezplatform-workflow
  v2.1.1"
