title: "Ibexa Kernel's files with block listed extensions can be still saved to drafts"
description: "File validation can be configured to reject certain files by file type.
  When this happens, validation fails, and the content can't be published. However,
  the file can be saved when saving the content draft. This means unwanted files can
  be present in storage, even if they are not easily accessible due to the content
  not being published. The fix ensures these unwanted file types are never stored.
  An attacker would need to have existing access to create content with a file field
  type to exploit this."
