title: "eZ Platform Prevent accepting app.php in URL in Platform.sh"
description: "The recommended rewrite rules in eZ Platform prevent users from including
  the front-controller script (normally \"app.php\") in URLs. This prevents certain
  vulnerabilities related to caching. However, this is not possible when using eZ
  Platform Cloud (i.e. running eZ Platform on the Platform.sh cloud service), nor
  can it be done within the .platform.app.yaml configuration file. Therefore we need
  to reject such requests in the application itself. This advisory adds the prevention
  within the front controller script itself.\n\nIf you use eZ Platform Cloud / Platform.sh
  we recommend that you install this security update as soon as possible. It is distributed
  via Composer as ezsystems/ezplatform 1.7.9.1, and 1.13.5.1, and 2.5.4. This is the
