title: "ezplatform-graphql GraphQL queries can expose password hashes"
description: "ezplatform-graphql is a GraphQL server implementation for Ibexa DXP
  and Ibexa Open Source. Versions prior to 2.3.12 and 1.0.13 are subject to Insecure
  Storage of Sensitive Information. Unauthenticated GraphQL queries for user accounts
  can expose password hashes of users that have created or modified content, typically
  administrators and editors. This issue has been patched in versions 2.3.12, and
  1.0.13 on the 1.X branch. Users unable to upgrade can remove the \"passwordHash\"
  entry from \"src/bundle/Resources/config/graphql/User.types.yaml\" in the GraphQL
  package, and other properties like hash type, email, login if you prefer."
