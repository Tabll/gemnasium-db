title: "eZ Platform Admin UI Password reset vulnerability"
description: "his Security Update fixes a severe vulnerability in the eZ Platform
  Admin UI, and we recommend that you install it as soon as possible. It affects eZ
  Platform 2.x.\n\nThe functionality for resetting a forgotten password is vulnerable
  to brute force attack. Depending on configuration and other circumstances an attacker
  may exploit this to gain control over user accounts. The update ensures such an
  attack is exceedingly unlikely to succeed.\n\nYou may want to consider a configuration
  change to further strengthen your security. By default a password reset request
  is valid for 1 hour. Reducing this time will make attacks even more difficult, but
  ensure there is enough time left to account for email delivery delays, and user
  delays. See documentation at https://doc.ezplatform.com/en/latest/guide/user_management/#changing-and-recovering-passwords\n\nTo
  install, use Composer to update to one of the \"Resolving versions\" mentioned above.
  If you use eZ Platform 2.5, update ezsystems/ezplatform-user to v1.0.1. If you use
  eZ Platform 2.4, update ezsystems/ezplatform-admin-ui to v1.4.6, and ezsystems/ezplatform-admin-ui-modules
  to v1.4.4, and ezsystems/repository-forms to v2.4.5)"
