title: "eZ Publish Legacy Passwordless login for LDAP users"
description: "This security advisory fixes a vulnerability in eZ Publish Legacy, and
  we recommend that you install it as soon as possible if you are using Legacy.\n\nInstallations
  that are using the legacy LDAP login handler or the TextFile login handler in combination
  with the standard legacy login handler, may in rare cases be vulnerable to a failure
  of the standard login handler to verify passwords correctly, allowing unauthorised
  access.\n\nIf your installation has never used the LDAP or TextFile login handlers,
  or never used legacy login at all, then it is not affected. Still, we recommend
  installing the update, to be on the safe side.\n\nTo install, use Composer to update
  to one of the \"Resolving versions\" mentioned above, or apply this patch manually:\nhttps://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-legacy/commit/13f03a2be6c0ee4d0caaafaef05904ea9b0c4d9d"
