title: "eZ Publish Information disclosure in backend content tree menu"
description: "This security advisory fixes an information disclosure vulnerability
  in the legacy admin content tree menu. If a view has been disabled in site.ini [SiteAccessRules]
  Rules, and an attacker accesses the backend with the URL to this module, then the
  tree menu may be displayed. Since the tree menu may contain hidden items, this may
  lead to information disclosure. We recommend that you install this Security Update
  as soon as possible.\n\nTo install, use Composer to update to one of the \"Resolving
  versions\" mentioned above, or apply this patch manually: https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-legacy/commit/a4a0470f8d80f012fe14e4f8ab11c7d14375986c"
