title: "eZ Publish Legacy Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in 'disabled module' error template"
description: "This security advisory fixes a vulnerability in eZ Publish Legacy, and
  we recommend that you install it as soon as possible if you are using Legacy via
  the LegacyBridge.\n\nInstallations where all modules are disabled may be vulnerable
  to XSS injection in the module name. This is a rare configuration, but we still
  recommend installing the update, which adds the necessary input washing.\n\nTo install,
  use Composer to update to one of the \"Resolving versions\" mentioned above, or
  apply this patch manually:\nhttps://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-legacy/commit/4697bff700e8cf95d5847ea19dad3479a77b02d9"
