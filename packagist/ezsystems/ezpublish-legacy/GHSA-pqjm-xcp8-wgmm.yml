title: "Ez Platform and Legacy are prone to an insecure interpretation of PHP/PHAR
  uploads"
description: "The eZ Platform and Legacy are affected by an issue related to how uploaded
  PHP and PHAR files are handled, and consists of two parts: 1. Web server configuration,
  and 2. Disabling the PHAR stream wrapper.\n\n**1. WEB SERVER CONFIGURATION**\nThe
  sample web server configuration in our documentation can in some cases allow the
  execution of uploaded PHP/PHAR code. This can be abused to allow priviledge escalation
  and breach of content access controls, among other things. Please ensure that your
  web server will not execute files in directories were files may be uploaded, such
  as web/var/ and ezpublish_legacy/var/\n\nAs an example, here is how you can make
  Apache return HTTP 403 Forbidden for a number of executable file types in your eZ
  Platform var directory. Please adapt it to your needs. It is then possible to enable
  logging of HTTP 403 in a separate log file if you wish, you could do this to see
  if someone is trying to abuse the server.\n```\nRewriteEngine On"
