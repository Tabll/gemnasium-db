title: "Ez Platform Object Injection in legacy shop module"
description: "This Security Advisory is about a vulnerability in the Legacy shop module.
  A backend editor could perform object injection in discount rules. This would require
  backend access and permission to edit discount rules. While object injection in
  itself is a serious vulnerability, the permission requirement means that normally
  only administrators would be able to exploit it, that's why it was classified as
  Medium severity."
