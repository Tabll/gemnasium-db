package_slug: "packagist/cardgate/woocommerce"
title: "Origin Validation Error"
description: "An issue was discovered in the CardGate Payments plugin through 3.1.15
  for WooCommerce. Lack of origin authentication in the IPN callback processing function
  in cardgate/cardgate.php allows an attacker to remotely replace critical plugin
  settings (merchant ID, secret key, etc.) and therefore bypass the payment process
  (e.g., spoof an order status by manually sending an IPN callback request with a
  valid signature but without real payment) and/or receive all of the subsequent payments."
