package_slug: "packagist/cardgate/magento2"
title: "Origin Validation Error"
description: "An issue was discovered in the CardGate Payments plugin through 2.0.30
  for Magento 2. Lack of origin authentication in the IPN callback processing function
  in Controller/Payment/Callback.php allows an attacker to remotely replace critical
  plugin settings (merchant ID, secret key, etc.) and therefore bypass the payment
  process (e.g., spoof an order status by manually sending an IPN callback request
  with a valid signature but without real payment) and/or receive all of the subsequent
  payments."
