title: "Magento LTS vulnerable to stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in admin system
  configs"
description: "This XSS vulnerability is about the system configs\n* design/header/welcome\n*
  design/header/logo_src\n* design/header/logo_src_small\n* design/header/logo_alt\n\nThey
  are intended to enable admins to set a text in the two cases, and to define an image
  url for the other two cases.\nBut because of previously missing escaping allowed
  to input arbitrary html and as a consequence also arbitrary JavaScript.\n\nWhile
  this is in most usage scenarios not a relevant issue, some people work with more
  restrictive roles in the backend. Here the ability to inject JavaScript with these
  settings would be an unintended and unwanted privilege."
