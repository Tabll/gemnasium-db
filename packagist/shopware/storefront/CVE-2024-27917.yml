title: "Shopware's session is persistent in Cache for 404 pages"
description: "### Impact\n\nThe Symfony Session Handler, pop's the Session Cookie
  and assign it to the Response. Since Shopware 6.5.8.0 the 404 pages, are cached,
  to improve the performance of 404 pages. So the cached Response, contains a Session
  Cookie when the Browser accessing the 404 page, has no cookies yet. The Symfony
  Session Handler is in use, when no explicit Session configuration has been done.\nWhen
  Redis is in use for Sessions using the PHP Redis extension, this exploiting code
  is not used.\n\n### Patches\nUpdate to Shopware version 6.5.8.7\n\n### Workarounds\nUsing
  Redis for Sessions, as this does not trigger the exploit code. Example configuration
  for Redis\n\n```ini\n# php.ini\nsession.save_handler = redis\nsession.save_path
  = \"tcp://127.0.0.1:6379\"\n```\n\n## Consequences\n\nAs an guest browser session
  has been cached on a 404 page, every missing image or directly reaching a 404 page
  will logout the customer or clear his cart.\n"
