description: "Shopware is an open commerce platform based on the Symfony php Framework
  and the Vue javascript framework. In affected versions guest sessions are shared
  between customers when HTTP cache is enabled. This can lead to inconsistent experiences
  for guest users. Setups with Varnish are not affected by this issue. This issue
  has been resolved in version 6.4.8.2. Users unable to upgrade should disable the
  HTTP Cache."
