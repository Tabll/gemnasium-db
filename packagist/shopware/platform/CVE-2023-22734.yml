description: "Shopware is an open source commerce platform based on Symfony Framework
  and Vue js. The newsletter double opt-in validation was not checked properly, and
  it was possible to skip the complete double opt in process. As a result operators
  may have inconsistencies in their newsletter systems. This problem has been fixed
  with version 6.4.18.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may
  find security measures are available via a plugin for major versions 6.1, 6.2, and
  6.3. Users may also disable newsletter registration completely."
