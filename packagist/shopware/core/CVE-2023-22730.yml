title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "Shopware is an open source commerce platform based on Symfony Framework
  and Vue js. In affected versions It was possible to put the same line item multiple
  times in the cart using the AP. The Cart Validators checked the line item's individuality
  and the user was able to bypass quantity limits in sales. This problem has been
  fixed with version 6.4.18.1. Users on major versions 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 may also
  obtain this fix via a plugin."
