title: "Improper Control of Generation of Code in Twig rendered views"
description: "Server-side Template Injection (SSTI) in Shopware 6 (<= v6.4.20.0, v6.5.0.0-rc1
  <= v6.5.0.0-rc4), affecting both shopware/core and shopware/platform GitHub repositories,
  allows remote attackers with access to a Twig environment without the Sandbox extension
  to bypass the validation checks in `Shopware\\Core\\Framework\\Adapter\\Twig\\SecurityExtension`
  and call any arbitrary PHP function and thus execute arbitrary code/commands via
  usage of fully-qualified names, supplied as array of strings, when referencing callables.
  Users are advised to upgrade to v6.4.20.1 to resolve this issue. This is a bypass
  of CVE-2023-22731.\n"
