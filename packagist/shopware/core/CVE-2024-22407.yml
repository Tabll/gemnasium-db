package_slug: "packagist/shopware/core"
title: "Improper Access Control"
description: "Shopware is an open headless commerce platform. In the Shopware CMS,
  the state handler for orders fails to sufficiently verify user authorizations for
  actions that modify the payment, delivery, and/or order status. Due to this inadequate
  implementation, users lacking 'write' permissions for orders are still able to change
  the order state. This issue has been addressed and users are advised to update to
  Shopware 6.5.7.4. For older versions of 6.1, 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4 corresponding security
  measures are also available via a plugin. For the full range of functions, we recommend
  updating to the latest Shopware version."
