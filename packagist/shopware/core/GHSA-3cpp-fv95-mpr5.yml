title: "Shopware vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) – order invoice"
description: "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a vulnerability that enables a
  malicious actor to manipulate an application server into performing HTTP requests
  to arbitrary domains. SSRF is commonly exploited to make the server initiate requests
  to its internal systems or other services within the same network, which are typically
  not exposed to external users. In some cases, SSRF can also be used to target external
  systems. A successful SSRF attack can result in unauthorized actions or access to
  data within the\norganization, the web application itself, or other backend systems
  the application communicates with. In worst-case scenario, a SSRF vulnerability
  can be exploited to execute malicious code on the server."
