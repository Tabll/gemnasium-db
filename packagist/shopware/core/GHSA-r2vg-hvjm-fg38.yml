title: "Shopware Customer Orders can be canceled, even if refunds are disabled"
description: "Refunds in general can be enabled through the administration setting
  `core.cart.enableOrderRefunds` (in the cart panel).Which visually shows and hides
  the button. However, using a custom crafted request, a customer can still cancel
  his own orders.As this is not checked inside the route (and also not in the controller):\n
  https://github.com/shopware/shopware/blob/trunk/src/Storefront/Controller/AccountOrderController.php#L98
  \n
  https://github.com/shopware/shopware/blob/trunk/src/Core/Checkout/Order/SalesChannel/CancelOrderRoute.php
  \n\nTo mitigate this, a check should be added to the `CancelOrderRoute` which verifies
  that the feature is enabled."
