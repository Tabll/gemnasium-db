package_slug: "packagist/shopware/core"
title: "Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File"
description: "Shopware is an open source commerce platform based on Symfony Framework
  and Vue js. In affected versions the log module would write out all kind of sent
  mails. An attacker with access to either the local system logs or a centralized
  logging store may have access to other users accounts. This issue has been addressed
  in version 6.4.18.1. For older versions of 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3, corresponding security
  measures are also available via a plugin. For the full range of functions, we recommend
  updating to the latest Shopware version. Users unable to upgrade may remove from
  all users the log module ACL rights or disable logging."
