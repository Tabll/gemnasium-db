title: "Shopware vulnerable to path traversal via Plugin upload"
description: "A path traversal vulnerability allows malicious actors to access files
  and folders that are outside the folder structure accessible to the affected function.
  This vulnerability occurs when an application uses unfiltered user input to point
  to the path of a specific file and retrieve it. This can result in gaining read/write
  access to sensitive information, application code, back-end systems and other (critical)
  files on the operating system. In certain cases, it is even possible to store arbitrary
  files outside the relevant directory structure on the server in order to gain access
  to the server."
