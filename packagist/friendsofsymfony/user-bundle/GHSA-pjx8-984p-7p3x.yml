title: "FOSUserBundle Entropy is lost in the TokenGenerator"
description: "Because of the usage of base_convert which looses precision for large
  inputs, the entropy of tokens generated by FOSUserBundle for the email confirmation
  and password resetting is lost. This makes these tokens much less random than they
  are expected to be, and so not cryptographically safe."
