title: "FOSUserBundle User Identity Validation Vulnerability"
description: "Versions of FOSUserBundle prior to 1.2.1 have been found to be vulnerable
  to a security issue related to user identity validation. Specifically, user refreshing
  was performed using the primary key instead of the username, leading to a potential
  security risk if a user is allowed to change their username. The fix in version
  1.2.1 addresses this issue by loading the user using the primary key during refreshing."
