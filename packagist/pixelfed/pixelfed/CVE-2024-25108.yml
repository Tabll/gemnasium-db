title: "Incorrect Authorization"
description: "Pixelfed is an open source photo sharing platform. When processing requests
  authorization was improperly and insufficiently checked, allowing attackers to access
  far more functionality than users intended, including to the administrative and
  moderator functionality of the Pixelfed server. This vulnerability affects every
  version of Pixelfed between v0.10.4 and v0.11.9, inclusive. A proof of concept of
  this vulnerability exists. This vulnerability affects every local user of a Pixelfed
  server, and can potentially affect the servers' ability to federate. Some user interaction
  is required to setup the conditions to be able to exercise the vulnerability, but
  the attacker could conduct this attack time-delayed manner, where user interaction
  is not actively required. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 0.11.11.
  Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
