title: "Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information"
description: "league/oauth2-server is an implementation of an OAuth 2.0 authorization
  server written in PHP. Starting in version 8.3.2 and prior to version 8.5.3, servers
  that passed their keys to the CryptKey constructor as as string instead of a file
  path will have had that key included in a LogicException message if they does not
  provide a valid pass phrase for the key where required. This issue has been patched
  so that the provided key is no longer exposed in the exception message in the scenario
  outlined above. Users should upgrade to version 8.5.3 to receive the patch. As a
  workaround, pass the key as a file instead of a string."
