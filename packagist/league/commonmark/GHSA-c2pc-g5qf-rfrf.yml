description: "Several polynomial time complexity issues in league/commonmark may lead
  to unbounded resource exhaustion and subsequent denial of service.\n\nMalicious
  users could trigger that inefficient code with carefully crafted Markdown inputs
  that are specifically designed to ensure the worst-case performance is reached.
  \ Sending multiple such requests in parallel could tie up all available CPU resources
  and/or PHP-FPM processes, leading to denial of service for legitimate users."
