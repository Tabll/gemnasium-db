title: "Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition"
description: "Flysystem is an open source file storage library for PHP. The whitespace
  normalisation using removes any unicode whitespace. Under certain specific conditions
  this could potentially allow a malicious user to execute code remotely. The conditions
  are: A user is allowed to supply the path or filename of an uploaded file, the supplied
  path or filename is not checked against unicode chars, the supplied pathname checked
  against an extension deny-list, not an allow-list, the supplied path or filename
  contains a unicode whitespace char in the extension, the uploaded file is stored
  in a directory that allows PHP code to be executed. Given these conditions are met
  a user can upload and execute arbitrary code on the system under attack."
