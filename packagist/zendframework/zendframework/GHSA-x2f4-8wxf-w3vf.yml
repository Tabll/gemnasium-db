title: "ZendFramework SQL injection due to execution of platform-specific SQL containing
  interpolations"
description: "The `Zend\\Db` component in Zend Framework 2 provides platform abstraction,
  which is used in particular for SQL abstraction. Two methods defined in the platform
  interface, `quoteValue()` and `quoteValueList()`, allow users to manually quote
  values for creating SQL statements; these are in turn consumed by aspects of the
  SQL abstraction platform, including `Zend\\Db\\Sql\\Sql::getSqlStringForSqlObject()`,
  and the `getSqlString()` method provided in a number of classes in the Zend\\Db\\Sql
  namespace.\n\nWhile these methods are primarily intended for debugging and logging
  purposes, developers can use them to produce SQL that is then passed to the driver
  to execute. Due to a flaw in how the `quoteValue()` and `quoteValueList()` methods
  were written, this can lead to potential SQL injection.\n\nThe offending code is
  located in any of the `Zend\\Db\\Adapter\\Platform*` objects, particularly the quoteValue()
  and `quoteValueList()` methods. These methods did not take into account most of
  the possible escapable characters that would need to be escaped when attempting
  to create a quoted value for interpolation into a SQL string. Moreover, these methods
  did value quoting without extension level coordination which, when available, takes
  character-sets into account when quoting."
