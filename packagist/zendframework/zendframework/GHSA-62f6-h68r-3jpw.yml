title: "Zendframework session validation vulnerability"
description: "`Zend\\Session` session validators do not work as expected if set prior
  to the start of a session.\n\nFor instance, the following test case fails (where
  `$this->manager` is an instance of `Zend\\Session\\SessionManager`):\n```\n$this\n->manager\n->getValidatorChain()\n->attach('session.validate',
  array(new RemoteAddr(), 'isValid'));\n\n$this->manager->start();\n\n$this->assertSame(\narray(\n'Zend\\Session\\Validator\\RemoteAddr'
  =3D> '',\n),\n$_SESSION['__ZF']['_VALID']\n);\n```\nThe implication is that subsequent
  calls to `Zend\\Session\\SessionManager#start()` (in later requests, assuming a
  session was created) will not have any validator metadata attached, which causes
  any validator metadata to be re-built from scratch, thus marking the session as
  valid.\n\nAn attacker is thus able to simply ignore session validators such as RemoteAddr
  or HttpUserAgent, since the \"signature\" that these validators check against is
  not being stored in the session."
