title: "Zendframework Remote Address Spoofing Vector in `Zend\\Http\\PhpEnvironment\\RemoteAddress`"
description: "The `Zend\\Http\\PhpEnvironment\\RemoteAddress` class provides features
  around detecting the internet protocol (IP) address for an incoming proxied request
  via the X-Forwarded-For header, taking into account a provided list of trusted proxy
  server IPs. Prior to 2.2.5, the class was not taking into account whether or not
  the IP address contained in PHP's `$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']` was in the trusted proxy
  server list.\n\nThe IETF draft specification indicates that if `$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']`
  is not a trusted proxy, it must be considered the originating IP address, and the
  value of X-Forwarded-For must be disregarded."
