title: "Potential Information Disclosure and Insufficient Entropy in Zend\\Captcha\\Word"
description: "Zend generates a \"word\" for a CAPTCHA challenge by selecting a sequence
  of random letters from a character set. The selection is performed using PHP's internal
  `array_rand()` function. This function does not generate sufficient entropy due
  to its usage of `rand()` instead of more cryptographically secure methods such as
  `openssl_pseudo_random_bytes()`. This can potentially lead to information disclosure
  should an attacker be able to brute force the random number generation."
