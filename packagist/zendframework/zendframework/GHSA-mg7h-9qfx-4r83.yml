title: "ZendFramework Potential Proxy Injection Vulnerabilities"
description: "`Zend\\Session\\Validator\\RemoteAddr` and `Zend\\View\\Helper\\ServerUrl`
  were found to be improperly parsing HTTP headers for proxy information, which could
  potentially allow an attacker to spoof a proxied IP or host name.\n\nIn `Zend\\Session\\Validator\\RemoteAddr`,
  if the client is behind a proxy server, the detection of the proxy URL was incorrect,
  and could lead to invalid results on subsequent lookups.\n\nIn `Zend\\View\\Helper\\ServerUrl`,
  if the server lives behind a proxy, the helper would always generate a URL based
  on the proxy host, regardless of whether or not this was desired; additionally,
  it did not take into account the proxy port or protocol, if provided."
