title: "ZendFramework Route Parameter Injection Via Query String in `Zend\\Mvc`"
description: "In Zend Framework 2, `Zend\\Mvc\\Router\\Http\\Query` is used primarily
  to allow appending query strings to URLs when assembled. However, due to the fact
  that it captures any query parameters into the RouteMatch, and the fact that RouteMatch
  parameters are merged with any parent routes, this can lead to overriding already
  captured routing parameters, bypassing constraints defined in the parents.\n\nAs
  an example, consider the following route definition:\n```\narray(\n'user' => array(\n'type'
  => 'segment',\n'options' => array(\n'route' => '/user/:key',\n'defaults' => array(\n'controller'
  => 'UserController',\n'action'     => 'show-action',\n),\n'constraints' => array(\n'key'
  => '[a-z0-9]+',\n),\n),\n'child_routes' => array(\n'query' => array('type' => 'query'),\n),\n),\n)\n```\nIf
  the request URI was /user/foo/?controller=SecretController&key=invalid_value, the
  RouteMatch returned after routing would contain the following:\n```\narray(\n'controller'
  => 'SecretController',\n'action'     => 'show-action',\n'key'        => 'invalid_value',\n)\n```\nThis
  would lead to execution of a different controller than intended, with a value for
  the key parameter that bypassed the constraints outlined in the parent route."
