title: "ZendOpenID potential security issue in login mechanism"
description: "Using the Consumer component of ZendOpenId (or Zend_OpenId in ZF1),
  it is possible to login using an arbitrary OpenID account (without knowing any secret
  information) by using a malicious OpenID Provider. That means OpenID it is possible
  to login using arbitrary OpenID Identity (MyOpenID, Google, etc), which are not
  under the control of our own OpenID Provider. Thus, we are able to impersonate any
  OpenID Identity against the framework.\n\nMoreover, the Consumer accepts OpenID
  tokens with arbitrary signed elements. The framework does not check if, for example,
  both openid.claimed_id and openid.endpoint_url are signed. It is just sufficient
  to sign one parameter. According to https://openid.net/specs/openid-authentication-2_0.html#positive_assertions,
  at least op_endpoint, return_to, response_nonce, assoc_handle, and, if present in
  the response, claimed_id and identity, must be signed."
