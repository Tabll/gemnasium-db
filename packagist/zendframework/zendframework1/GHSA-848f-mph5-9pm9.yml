title: "Zendframework Potential Information Disclosure and Insufficient Entropy vulnerability"
description: "In Zend Framework, Zend_Captcha_Word (v1) and Zend\\Captcha\\Word (v2)
  generate a \"word\" for a CAPTCHA challenge by selecting a sequence of random letters
  from a character set. Prior to this advisory, the selection was performed using
  PHP's internal array_rand() function. This function does not generate sufficient
  entropy due to its usage of rand() instead of more cryptographically secure methods
  such as openssl_pseudo_random_bytes(). This could potentially lead to information
  disclosure should an attacker be able to brute force the random number generation."
