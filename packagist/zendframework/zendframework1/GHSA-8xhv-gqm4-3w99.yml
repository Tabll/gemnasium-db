title: "ZendFramework1 Potential Insufficient Entropy Vulnerability"
description: "We discovered several methods used to generate random numbers in ZF1
  that potentially used insufficient entropy. These random number generators are used
  in the following method calls:\n```\nZend_Ldap_Attribute::createPassword\nZend_Form_Element_Hash::_generateHash\nZend_Gdata_HttpClient::filterHttpRequest\nZend_Filter_Encrypt_Mcrypt::_srand\nZend_OpenId::randomBytes\n```\nIn
  each case, the methods were using rand() or mt_rand(), neither of which can generate
  cryptographically secure values. This could potentially lead to information disclosure
  should an attacker be able to brute force the random number generation.\n\nMoreover,
  we discovered a potential security issue in the usage of the [openssl_random_pseudo_bytes()](http://php.net/manual/en/function.openssl-random-pseudo-bytes.php)
  function in Zend_Crypt_Math::randBytes, reported in PHP BUG [#70014](https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=70014),
  and the security implications reported in a discussion [on the random_compat library.](https://github.com/paragonie/random_compat/issues/96)"
