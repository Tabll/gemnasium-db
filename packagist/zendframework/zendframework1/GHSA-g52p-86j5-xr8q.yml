title: "ZendFramework Potential Cross-site Scripting in Development Environment Error
  View Script"
description: "The default error handling view script generated using `Zend_Tool` failed
  to escape request parameters when run in the \"development\" configuration environment,
  providing a potential XSS attack vector.\n\n`Zend_Tool_Project_Context_Zf_ViewScriptFile`
  was patched such that the view script template now calls the `escape()` method on
  dumped request variables.\n\nZend Framework 1.11.4 includes a patch that adds escaping
  to the generated error/error.phtml view script, ensuring that request variables
  are escaped appropriately for the browser.\nDo note, however, that this will not
  update any previously generated code. You will still need to follow the next advice
  for previously generated error view scripts."
