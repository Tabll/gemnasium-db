title: "ZendFramework local file inclusion vector in `Zend_View::setScriptPath()`
  and `render()`"
description: "Zend_View is a component that utilizes PHP as a templating language.
  To utilize it, you specify \"script paths\" that contain view scripts, and then
  `render()` view scripts by specifying subdirectories within those script paths;
  the output is then returned as a string value which may be cached or directly output.\n\n`Zend_View::setScriptPath()`
  in versions up to and including 1.7.4 include a potential Local File Inclusion vulnerability.
  If untrusted input is used to specify the script path and/or view script itself,
  a malicious attacker could potentially specify a system directory and thus render
  a system file.\n\nAs an example, if the user-supplied string `/etc/passwd` or a
  relative path that resolved to that file, was supplied to `Zend_View::render()`,
  that file would be rendered."
