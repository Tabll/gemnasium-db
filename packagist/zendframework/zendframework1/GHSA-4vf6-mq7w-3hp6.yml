title: "Zend_Filter_StripTags vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting when comments allowed"
description: "Zend_Filter_StripTags contained an optional setting to allow allowlisting
  HTML comments in filtered text. Microsoft Internet Explorer and several other browsers
  allow developers to create conditional functionality via HTML comments, including
  execution of script events and rendering of additional commented markup. By allowing
  allowlisting of HTML comments, a malicious user could potentially include XSS exploits
  within HTML comments that would then be rendered in the final output."
