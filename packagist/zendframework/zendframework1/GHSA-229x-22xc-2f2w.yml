title: "Zendframework Local file disclosure via XXE injection in Zend_XmlRpc"
description: "Zend_XmlRpc is vulnerable to XML eXternal Entity (XXE) Injection attacks.
  The SimpleXMLElement class (SimpleXML PHP extension) is used in an insecure way
  to parse XML data. External entities can be specified by adding a specific DOCTYPE
  element to XML-RPC requests. By exploiting this vulnerability an application may
  be coerced to open arbitrary files and/or TCP connections."
