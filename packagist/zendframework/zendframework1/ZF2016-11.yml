title: "Potential Insufficient Entropy"
description: "There are several methods used to generate random numbers in ZF1 that
  potentially used insufficient entropy. Moreover, there's a potential security issue
  in the usage of the `openssl_random_pseudo_bytes()` function in `Zend_Crypt_Math::randBytes`,
  reported in PHP BUG #70014, and the security implications reported in a discussion
  on the `random_compat` library."
