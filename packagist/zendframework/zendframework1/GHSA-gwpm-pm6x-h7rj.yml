title: "ZendFramework Cross-site Scripting vector in `Zend_Filter_StripTags`"
description: "`Zend_Filter_StripTags` is a filtering class analogous to PHP's `strip_tags()`
  function. In addition to stripping HTML tags and selectively keeping those provided
  in a allowlist, it also provides the ability to allowlist specific attributes to
  retain per allowlisted tag.\n\nThe reporter discovered that attributes that contained
  allowspace, and in paricular, line breaks, surrounding the attribute assignment
  operator would not be stripped, regardless of whether or not they were allowlisted.
  As examples of input affected:\n```\n<!-- newlines before and/or after assignment:
  -->\n<a href=\"http://framework.zend.com/issues\" onclick\n=\n\"alert('Broken');
  return false;\">Issues</a>\n```\nWhen passed to the following code:\n```\n$filter
  = new Zend_Filter_StripTags(array('a' => array('href')));\n$value  = $filter->($html);\n```\nthen
  the \"onclick\" attribute would remain, even though it was not specified in the
  tag's allowlist. This could open potential cross-site scripting attack (XSS) vectors."
