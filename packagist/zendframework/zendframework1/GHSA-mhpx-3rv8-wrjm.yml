title: "ZendFramework potential XML eXternal Entity injection vectors"
description: "Numerous components utilizing PHP's `DOMDocument`, `SimpleXML`, and
  `xml_parse` functionality are vulnerable to two types of attacks:\n\n- XML eXternal
  Entity (XXE) Injection attacks. The above mentioned extensions are insecure by default,
  allowing external entities to be specified by adding a specific DOCTYPE element
  to XML documents and strings. By exploiting this vulnerability an application may
  be coerced to open arbitrary files and/or TCP connections.\n- XML Entity Expansion
  (XEE) vectors, leading to Denial of Service vectors. XEE attacks occur when the
  XML DOCTYPE declaration includes XML entity definitions that contain either recursive
  or circular references; this leads to CPU and memory consumption, making Denial
  of Service exploits trivial to implement."
