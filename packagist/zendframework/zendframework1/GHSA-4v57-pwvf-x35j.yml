title: "Zendframework potential Cross-site Scripting vector in `Zend_Service_ReCaptcha_MailHide`"
description: "`Zend_Service_ReCaptcha_MailHide` had a potential XSS vulnerability.
  Due to the fact that the email address was never validated, and because its use
  of `htmlentities()` did not include the encoding argument, it was potentially possible
  for a malicious user aware of the issue to inject a specially crafted multibyte
  string as an attack via the CAPTCHA's email argument"
