title: "Zend-Captcha Information Disclosure and Insufficient Entropy vulnerability"
description: "In Zend Framework, `Zend_Captcha_Word` (v1) and `Zend\\Captcha\\Word`
  (v2) generate a \"word\" for a CAPTCHA challenge by selecting a sequence of random
  letters from a character set. Prior to this advisory, the selection was performed
  using PHP's internal `array_rand()` function. This function does not generate sufficient
  entropy due to its usage of rand() instead of more cryptographically secure methods
  such as `openssl_pseudo_random_bytes()`. This could potentially lead to information
  disclosure should an attacker be able to brute force the random number generation."
