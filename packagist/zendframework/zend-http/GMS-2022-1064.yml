title: "URL Rewrite vulnerability in multiple zendframework components"
description: "zend-diactoros (and, by extension, Expressive), zend-http (and, by extension,
  Zend Framework MVC projects), and zend-feed (specifically, its PubSubHubbub sub-component)
  each contain a potential URL rewrite exploit. In each case, marshaling a request
  URI includes logic that introspects HTTP request headers that are specific to a
  given server-side URL rewrite mechanism.\n\nWhen these headers are present on systems
  not running the specific URL rewriting mechanism, the logic would still trigger,
  allowing a malicious client or proxy to emulate the headers to request arbitrary
  content."
