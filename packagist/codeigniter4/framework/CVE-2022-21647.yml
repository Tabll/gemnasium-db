description: "CodeIgniter is an open source PHP full-stack web framework. Deserialization
  of Untrusted Data was found in the `old()` function in CodeIgniter4. Remote attackers
  may inject auto-loadable arbitrary objects with this vulnerability, and possibly
  execute existing PHP code on the server. We are aware of a working exploit, which

  unable to upgrade as advised to not use the `old()` function and form_helper nor
