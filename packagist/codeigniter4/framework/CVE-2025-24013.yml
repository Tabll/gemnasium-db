title: "Missing validation of header name and value in codeigniter4/framework"
description: "Lack of proper header validation for its name and value. The potential
  attacker can construct deliberately malformed headers with `Header` class. This
  could disrupt application functionality, potentially causing errors or generating
  invalid HTTP requests. In some cases, these malformed requests might lead to a DoS
  scenario if a remote serviceâ€™s web application firewall interprets them as malicious
  and blocks further communication with the application."
