identifier: "CVE-2020-10793"
package_slug: "packagist/codeigniter4/framework"
title: "Improper Privilege Management"
description: "CodeIgniter allows remote attackers to gain privileges via a modified
  Email ID to the \"Select Role of the User\" page. NOTE: A contributor to the CodeIgniter
  framework argues that the issue should not be attributed to CodeIgniter. Furthermore,
  the blog post reference shows an unknown website built with the CodeIgniter framework
  but that CodeIgniter is not responsible for introducing this issue because the framework
  has never provided a login screen, nor any kind of login or user management facilities
  beyond a Session library."
