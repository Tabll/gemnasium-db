package_slug: "packagist/codeigniter4/framework"
title: "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
description: "CodeIgniter4 is the 4.x branch of CodeIgniter, a PHP full-stack web
  framework. A vulnerability in versions prior to 4.1.9 might allow remote attackers
  to bypass the CodeIgniter4 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection mechanism.
  Users should upgrade to version 4.1.9. There are workarounds for this vulnerability,
  but users will still need to code as these after upgrading to v4.1.9. Otherwise,
  the CSRF protection may be bypassed. If auto-routing is enabled, check the request
  method in the controller method before processing. If auto-routing is disabled,
  either avoid using `$routes->add()` and instead use HTTP verbs in routes; or check
  the request method in the controller method before processing."
