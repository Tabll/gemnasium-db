title: "Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in HMAC SHA256 Authentication"
description: "### Impact\n**secretKey**, an important key for HMAC SHA256 authentication,
  was stored in the database in raw form.\n\nIf a malicious person somehow had access
  to the data in the database, they could use the key and secretKey for HMAC SHA256
  authentication to send requests impersonating that person.\n\n### Patches\nUpgrade
  to Shield v1.0.0-beta.8 or later.\n\nAfter upgrading, all existing secret keys must
  be encrypted.\nSee https://github.com/codeigniter4/shield/blob/develop/UPGRADING.md
  for details.\n\n### Workarounds\nNone.\n\n### References\n- https://codeigniter4.github.io/shield/references/authentication/hmac/\n\n###
