package_slug: "packagist/bagisto/bagisto"
title: "bagisto has CSV Formula Injection in Create New Product"
description: "When product data that begins with a spreadsheet formula character (for
  example =, +, -, or @) is accepted and later exported or saved into a CSV and opened
  in spreadsheet software, the spreadsheet will interpret that cell as a formula.
  This allows an attacker to supply a CSV field (e.g., product name) that contains
  a formula which may be evaluated by a victim’s spreadsheet application — potentially
  leading to data exfiltration and remote command execution (via older Excel exploits
  / OLE/cmd constructs or Excel macros)."
