title: "Bagisto has HTML Filter Bypass that Enables Stored XSS"
description: "A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Bagisto
  2.3.8 within the CMS page editor. Although the platform normally attempts to sanitize
  `<script>` tags, the filtering can be bypassed by manipulating the raw HTTP POST
  request before submission. As a result, arbitrary JavaScript can be stored in the
  CMS content and executed whenever the page is viewed or edited.\nThis exposes administrators
  to a high-severity risk, including complete account takeover, backend hijacking,
  and malicious script execution."
