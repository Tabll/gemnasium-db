title: "bagisto has Server Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Product Description"
description: "Bagisto v2.3.7 is vulnerable to Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)
  due to unsanitized user input being processed by the server-side templating engine
  when rendering product descriptions. This allows an attacker with product creation
  privileges to inject arbitrary template expressions that are evaluated by the backend
  â€” potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server."
