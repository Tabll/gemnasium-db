title: "Insufficient Session Expiration in Pterodactyl API"
description: "### Impact\nA vulnerability exists in Pterodactyl Panel `<= 1.6.6` that
  could allow a malicious attacker that compromises an API key to generate an authenticated
  user session that is not revoked when the API key is deleted, thus allowing the
  malicious user to remain logged in as the user the key belonged to.\n\nIt is important
  to note that **a malicious user must first compromise an existing API key for a
  user to exploit this issue**. It cannot be exploited by chance, and requires a coordinated
  attack against an individual account using a known API key.\n\n### Patches\nThis
  issue has been addressed in the `v1.7.0` release of Pterodactyl Panel.\n\n### Workarounds\nThose
  not wishing to upgrade may apply the change below:\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/app/Http/Middleware/Api/AuthenticateKey.php
