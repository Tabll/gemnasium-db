title: "Pterodactyl Panel Allows Unauthenticated Arbitrary Remote Code Execution"
description: "Using the `/locales/locale.json` with the `locale` and `namespace` query
  parameters, a malicious actor is able to execute arbitrary code, without being authenticated.\n\nWith
  the ability to execute arbitrary code, this vulnerability can be exploited in an
  infinite number of ways.  It could be used to gain access to the Panel's server,
  read credentials from the Panel's config (`.env` or otherwise), extract sensitive
  information from the database (such as user details [username, email, first and
  last name, hashed password, ip addresses, etc]), access files of servers managed
  by the panel, etc."
