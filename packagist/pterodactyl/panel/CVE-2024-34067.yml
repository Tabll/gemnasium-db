title: "Pterodactyl panel's admin area vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting"
description: "Importing a malicious egg or gaining access to wings instance could
  lead to XSS on the panel, which could be used to gain an administrator account on
  the panel. Specifically, the following things are impacted:\n- Egg Docker images\n-
  Egg variables:\n- Name\n- Environment variable\n- Default value\n- Description\n-
  Validation rules\n\nAdditionally, certain fields would reflect malicious input,
  but it would require the user knowingly entering such input to have an impact.\n\nTo
  iterate, this would require an administrator to perform actions and can't be triggered
  by a normal panel user."
