package_slug: "packagist/pterodactyl/panel"
title: "Pterodactyl Panel has plain-text logging of user passwords when two-factor
  authentication is disabled"
description: "When a user disables two-factor authentication via the Panel, a `DELETE`
  request with their current password in a query parameter will be sent.  While query
  parameters are encrypted when using TLS, many webservers (including ones officially
  documented for use with Pterodactyl) will log query parameters in plain-text, storing
  a user's password in plain text.\n\nIf a malicious user obtains access to these
  logs they could *potentially* authenticate against a user's account; assuming they
  are able to discover the account's email address or username **separately**."
