title: "Pterodactyl has a Reflected XSS vulnerability in “Create New Database Host”"
description: "When an administrative user creates a new database host they are prompted
  to provide a `Host` value which is expected to be a domain or IP address. When an
  invalid value is encountered and passed back to `gethostaddr` and/or directly to
  the MySQL connection tooling, an error is returned. This error is then passed back
  along to the front-end, but was not properly sanitized when rendered.\n\nTherefore
  it is possible for an admin to _knowingly_ paste a malicious payload such as `<script>prompt(document.domain)</script>`
  into the `Host` field and XSS themselves."
