package_slug: "packagist/pterodactyl/panel"
title: "Pterodactyl Panel Allows Cross-Node Server Configuration Disclosure via Remote
  API Missing Authorization"
description: "A missing authorization check in multiple controllers allows any user
  with access to a node secret token to fetch information about any server on a Pterodactyl
  instance, even if that server is associated with a different node. This issue stems
  from missing logic to verify that the node requesting server data is the same node
  that the server is associated with.\n\nAny authenticated Wings node can retrieve
  server installation scripts (potentially containing secret values) and manipulate
  the installation status of servers belonging to other nodes. Wings nodes may also
  manipulate the transfer status of servers belonging to other nodes.\n\n_This vulnerability
  requires a user to acquire a secret access token for a node. We rated this issue
  based on potential worst outcome. Unless a user gains access to a Wings secret access
  token they would not be able to access any of these vulnerable endpoints, as every
  endpoint requires a valid node access token._"
