- "GHSA-rgmp-4873-r683"
package_slug: "packagist/pterodactyl/panel"
title: "Pterodactyl TOTPs can be reused during validity window"
description: "When a user signs into an account with 2FA enabled they are prompted
  to enter a token. When that token is used, it is not sufficiently marked as used
  in the system allowing an attacker that intercepts that token to then use it in
  addition to a known username/password during the token validity window.\n\nThis
  vulnerability requires that an attacker already be in possession of a valid username
  and password combination, and intercept a valid 2FA token (for example, during a
  screen share). The token must then be provided in addition to the username and password
  during the limited token validity window. The validity window is ~60 seconds as
  the Panel allows at most one additional window to the current one, each window being
  30 seconds."
