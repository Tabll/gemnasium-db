package_slug: "packagist/pterodactyl/panel"
title: "Pterodactyl improperly locks resources allowing raced queries to create more
  resources than alloted"
description: "Pterodactyl implements rate limits that are applied to the total number
  of resources (e.g. databases, port allocations, or backups) that can exist for an
  individual server. These resource limits are applied on a per-server basis, and
  validated during the request cycle.\n\nHowever, it is possible for a malicious user
  to send a massive volume of requests at the same time that would create more resources
  than the server is allotted. This is because the validation occurs early in the
  request cycle and does not lock the target resource while it is processing. As a
  result sending a large volume of requests at the same time would lead all of those
  requests to validate as not using any of the target resources, and then all creating
  the resources at the same time.\n\nAs a result a server would be able to create
  more databases, allocations, or backups than configured."
