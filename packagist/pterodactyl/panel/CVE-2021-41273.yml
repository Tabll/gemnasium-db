package_slug: "packagist/pterodactyl/panel"
title: "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
description: "Pterodactyl is an open-source game server management panel built with
  PHP 7, React, and Go. Due to improperly configured CSRF protections on two routes,
  a malicious user could execute a CSRF-based attack against the following endpoints:
  Sending a test email and Generating a node auto-deployment token. At no point would
  any data be exposed to the malicious user, this would simply trigger email spam
  to an administrative user, or generate a single auto-deployment token unexpectedly.
  This token is not revealed to the malicious user, it is simply created unexpectedly
  in the system. This has been addressed in release `1.6.6`. Users may optionally
  manually apply the fixes released in v1.6.6 to patch their own systems."
