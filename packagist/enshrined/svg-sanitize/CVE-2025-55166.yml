package_slug: "packagist/enshrined/svg-sanitize"
title: "svg-sanitizer Bypasses Attribute Sanitization"
description: "#### Problem\n\nThe sanitization logic at https://github.com/darylldoyle/svg-sanitizer/blob/0.21.0/src/Sanitizer.php#L454-L481
  only searches for lower-case attribute names (e.g. `xlink:href` instead of `xlink:HrEf`),
  which allows to by-pass the `isHrefSafeValue` check. As a result this allows cross-site
  scripting or linking to external domains.\n\n#### Proof-of-concept\n_provided by
  azizk_\n\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"
  xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\">\n  <a

  fill=\"red\"></rect>\n    <text x=\"50\" y=\"30\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"white\">Click
  me</text>\n  </a>\n</svg>\n```\n\n#### Credits\n\nThe mentioned findings and proof-of-concept
  example were reported to the TYPO3 Security Team by the external security researcher
