package_slug: "packagist/alextselegidis/easyappointments"
title: "alextselegidis/easyappointments is Vulnerable to CSRF Protection Bypass"
description: "`application/core/EA_Security.php::csrf_verify()` only enforces CSRF
  for POST requests and returns early for non-POST methods. Several application endpoints
  perform state-changing operations while accepting parameters from GET (or $_REQUEST),
  so an attacker can perform CSRF by forcing a victim's browser to issue a crafted
  GET request. Impact: creation of admin accounts, modification of admin email/password,
  and full admin account takeover"
