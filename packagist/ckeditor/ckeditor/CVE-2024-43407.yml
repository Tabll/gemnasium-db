  (XSS) vulnerability"
description: "A potential vulnerability has been discovered in CKEditor 4 [Code Snippet
  GeSHi](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/codesnippetgeshi) plugin. The vulnerability
  allowed a reflected XSS attack by exploiting a flaw in the [GeSHi syntax highlighter
  library](https://github.com/GeSHi/geshi-1.0) hosted by the victim.\n\nThe GeSHi
  library was included as a vendor dependency in CKEditor 4 source files. In a specific
