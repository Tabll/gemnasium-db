title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "CKEditor4 is an open source what-you-see-is-what-you-get HTML editor.
  A cross-site scripting vulnerability has been discovered in the core HTML parsing
  module in versions of CKEditor4 prior to 4.24.0-lts. It may affect all editor instances
  that enabled full-page editing mode or enabled CDATA elements in Advanced Content
  Filtering configuration (defaults to `script` and `style` elements). The vulnerability
  allows attackers to inject malformed HTML content bypassing Advanced Content Filtering
  mechanism, which could result in executing JavaScript code. An attacker could abuse
  faulty CDATA content detection and use it to prepare an intentional attack on the
  editor. A fix is available in version 4.24.0-lts."
