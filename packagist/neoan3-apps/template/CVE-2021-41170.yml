- "GHSA-3v56-q6r6-4gcw"
package_slug: "packagist/neoan3-apps/template"
title: "Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource"
description: "neoan3-apps/template allows for passing in closures directly into the
  template engine. As a result, values that are callable are executed by the template
  engine. The issue arises if a value has the same name as a method or function in
  scope and can therefore be executed either by mistake or maliciously. In theory
  all users of the package are affected as long as they either deal with direct user
  input or database values."
