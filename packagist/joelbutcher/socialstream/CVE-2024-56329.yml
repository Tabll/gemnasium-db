package_slug: "packagist/joelbutcher/socialstream"
title: "Socialstream has a Potential Account Takeover Vulnerability in Social Account
  Linking Due to Missing User Consent After OAuth Callback"
description: "When linking a social account to an already authenticated user, the
  lack of a confirmation step introduces a security risk. This is exacerbated if ->stateless()
  is used in the Socialite configuration, bypassing state verification and making
  the exploit easier. Developers should ensure that users explicitly confirm account
  linking and avoid configurations that skip critical security checks."
