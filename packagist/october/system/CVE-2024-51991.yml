title: "October CMS Allows Unprotected SVG Rename in Media Manager"
description: "This advisory affects authenticated administrators with sites that have
  the `media.clean_vectors` configuration enabled. This configuration will sanitize
  SVG files uploaded using the media manager. This vulnerability allows an authenticated
  user to bypass this protection by uploading it with a permitted extension (for example,
  .jpg or .png) and later modifying it to the .svg extension.\n\nThis vulnerability
  assumes a trusted user will attack another trusted user and cannot be actively exploited
  without access to the administration panel and interaction from the other user."
