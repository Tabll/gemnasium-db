package_slug: "packagist/october/system"
title: "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature"
description: "Octobercms is a self-hosted CMS platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework.
  Affected versions of OctoberCMS does not validate gateway server signatures. As
  a result non-authoritative gateway servers may be used to exfiltrate user private
  keys. Users are advised to upgrade their installations to build 474 or v1.1.10.
  The only known workaround is to manually apply the patch (e3b455ad587282f0fbcb7763c6d9c3d000ca1e6a)
  which adds server signature validation."
