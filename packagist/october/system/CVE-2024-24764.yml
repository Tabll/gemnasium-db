package_slug: "packagist/october/system"
title: "October System module has an Open Redirect for Administrator Accounts"
description: "This advisory affects authenticated administrators who may be redirected
  to an untrusted URL using the PageFinder schema.  The resolver for the page finder
  link schema (`october://`) allowed external links, therefore allowing an open redirect
  outside the scope of the active host.\n\nThis vulnerability assumes a trusted user
  will attack another trusted user and cannot be actively exploited without access
  to the administration panel and interaction from the other user."
