package_slug: "packagist/october/system"
title: "Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')"
description: "October is a self-hosted Content Management System (CMS) platform based
  on the Laravel PHP Framework. This vulnerability only affects installations that
  rely on the safe mode restriction, commonly used when providing public access to
  the admin panel. Assuming an attacker has access to the admin panel and permission
  to open the \"Editor\" section, they can bypass the Safe Mode (`cms.safe_mode`)
  restriction to introduce new PHP code in a CMS template using a specially crafted
  request. The issue has been patched in versions 2.2.34 and 3.0.66."
