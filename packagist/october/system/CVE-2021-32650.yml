title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream
  Component ('Injection')"
description: "October CMS is a self-hosted content management system (CMS) platform
  based on the Laravel PHP Framework. Prior to versions 1.0.473 and 1.1.6, an attacker
  with access to the backend is able to execute PHP code by using the theme import
  feature. This will bypass the safe mode feature that prevents PHP execution in the
  CMS templates.The issue has been patched in Build 473 (v1.0.473) and v1.1.6. Those
  unable to upgrade may apply the patch to their installation manually as a workaround."
