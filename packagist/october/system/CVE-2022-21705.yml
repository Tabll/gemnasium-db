title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream
  Component ('Injection')"
description: "Octobercms is a self-hosted CMS platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework.
  In affected versions user input was not properly sanitized before rendering. An
  authenticated user with the permissions to create, modify and delete website pages
  can exploit this vulnerability to bypass `cms.safe_mode` / `cms.enableSafeMode`
  in order to execute arbitrary code. This issue only affects admin panels that rely
  on safe mode and restricted permissions. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker
  must first have access to the backend area. The issue has been patched in Build
  474 (v1.0.474) and v1.1.10."
