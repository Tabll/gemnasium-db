identifier: "CVE-2020-5299"
package_slug: "packagist/october/october"
title: "Command Injection"
description: "In OctoberCMS, any users with the ability to modify any data that could
  eventually be exported as a CSV file from the `ImportExportController` could potentially
  introduce a CSV injection into the data to cause the generated CSV export file to
  be malicious. This requires attackers to achieve the following before a successful
  attack can be completed: Have found a vulnerability in the victim's spreadsheet
  software of choice. Control data that would potentially be exported through the
  `ImportExportController` by a theoretical victim. Convince the victim to export
  above data as a CSV and run it in vulnerable spreadsheet software while also bypassing
  any sanity checks by said software."
