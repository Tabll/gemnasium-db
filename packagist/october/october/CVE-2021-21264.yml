package_slug: "packagist/october/october"
title: "Missing Authorization"
description: "October is a free, open-source, self-hosted CMS platform based on the
  Laravel PHP Framework. A bypass of CVE-2020-26231 was discovered that has the same
  impact as CVE-2020-26231 & CVE-2020-15247. An authenticated backend user with the
  `cms.manage_pages`, `cms.manage_layouts`, or `cms.manage_partials` permissions who
  would **normally** not be permitted to provide PHP code to be executed by the CMS
  due to `cms.enableSafeMode` being enabled is able to write specific Twig code to
  escape the Twig sandbox and execute arbitrary PHP. This is not a problem for anyone
  that trusts their users with those permissions to normally write & manage PHP within
  the CMS by not having `cms.enableSafeMode` enabled, but would be a problem for anyone
  relying on `cms.enableSafeMode` to ensure that users with those permissions in production
  do not have access to write & execute arbitrary PHP."
