identifier: "CVE-2020-15247"
package_slug: "packagist/october/october"
title: "Missing Authorization"
description: "October is a free, open-source, self-hosted CMS platform based on the
  Laravel PHP Framework. In October CMS, an authenticated backend user with the `cms.manage_pages`,
  `cms.manage_layouts`, or `cms.manage_partials` permissions who would normally not
  be permitted to provide PHP code to be executed by the CMS due to `cms.enableSafeMode`
  being enabled is able to write specific Twig code to escape the Twig sandbox and
  execute arbitrary PHP. This is not a problem for anyone that trusts their users
  with those permissions to normally write & manage PHP within the CMS by not having
  `cms.enableSafeMode` enabled, but would be a problem for anyone relying on `cms.enableSafeMode`
  to ensure that users with those permissions in production do not have access to
  write & execute arbitrary PHP."
