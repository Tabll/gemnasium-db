identifier: "CVE-2020-15249"
package_slug: "packagist/october/october"
title: "Cross-site Scripting"
description: "October is a free, open-source, self-hosted CMS platform based on the
  Laravel PHP Framework. In October CMS from and, backend users with access to upload
  files were permitted to upload SVG files without any sanitization applied to the
  uploaded files. Since SVG files support being parsed as HTML by browsers, this means
  that they could theoretically upload Javascript that would be executed on a path
  under the website's domain (`i.e.` `/storage/app/media/evil.svg)`, but they would
  have to convince their target to visit that location directly in the target's browser
  as the backend does not display SVGs inline anywhere, SVGs are only displayed as
  image resources in the backend and are thus unable to be executed."
