identifier: "CVE-2021-21265"
package_slug: "packagist/october/october"
title: "Improper Neutralization of HTTP Headers for Scripting Syntax"
description: "October is a free, open-source, self-hosted CMS platform based on the
  Laravel PHP Framework. In October, when running on poorly configured servers (i.e.,
  the server routes any request, regardless of the HOST header to an October CMS instance)
  the potential exists for Host Header Poisoning attacks to succeed. This has been
  addressed by adding a feature to allow a set of trusted hosts to be specified in
  the application. As a workaround one may set the configuration setting `cms.linkPolicy`
  to force."
