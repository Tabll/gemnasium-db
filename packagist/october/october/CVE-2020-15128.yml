identifier: "CVE-2020-15128"
package_slug: "packagist/october/october"
title: "Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking"
description: "In OctoberCMS, encrypted cookie values were not tied to the name of
  the cookie the value belonged to. This meant that certain classes of attacks that
  took advantage of other theoretical vulnerabilities in user facing code (nothing
  exploitable in the core project itself) had a higher chance of succeeding. Specifically,
  if your usage exposed a way for users to provide unfiltered user input and have
  it returned to them as an encrypted cookie (ex. storing a user provided search query
  in a cookie) they could then use the generated cookie in place of other more tightly
  controlled cookies; or if your usage exposed the plaintext version of an encrypted
  cookie at any point to the user they could theoretically provide encrypted content
  from your application back to it as an encrypted cookie and force the framework
  to decrypt it for them."
