title: "Missing Authorization"
description: "October is a free, open-source, self-hosted CMS platform based on the
  Laravel PHP Framework. A bypass of CVE-2020-15247 (fixed in 1.0.469 and 1.1.0) was
  discovered that has the same impact as CVE-2020-15247. An authenticated backend
  user with the cms.manage_pages, cms.manage_layouts, or cms.manage_partials permissions
  who would normally not be permitted to provide PHP code to be executed by the CMS
  due to cms.enableSafeMode being enabled is able to write specific Twig code to escape
  the Twig sandbox and execute arbitrary PHP. This is not a problem for anyone that
  trusts their users with those permissions to normally write & manage PHP within
  the CMS by not having cms.enableSafeMode enabled, but would be a problem for anyone
  relying on cms.enableSafeMode to ensure that users with those permissions in production
  do not have access to write & execute arbitrary PHP. Issue has been patched in Build
  470 (v1.0.470) and v1.1.1."
