title: "Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking"
description: "In OctoberCMS before version 1.0.468, encrypted cookie values were not
  tied to the name of the cookie the value belonged to. This meant that certain classes
  of attacks that took advantage of other theoretical vulnerabilities in user facing
  code (nothing exploitable in the core project itself) had a higher chance of succeeding.
  Specifically, if your usage exposed a way for users to provide unfiltered user input
  and have it returned to them as an encrypted cookie (ex. storing a user provided
  search query in a cookie) they could then use the generated cookie in place of other
  more tightly controlled cookies; or if your usage exposed the plaintext version
  of an encrypted cookie at any point to the user they could theoretically provide
  encrypted content from your application back to it as an encrypted cookie and force
  the framework to decrypt it for them. Issue has been fixed in build 468 (v1.0.468)."
