title: "Insufficient Session Expiration"
description: "An issue was discovered in October through build 471. It reactivates
  an old session ID (which had been invalid after a logout) once a new login occurs.
  NOTE: this violates the intended Auth/Manager.php authentication behavior but, admittedly,
  is only relevant if an old session ID is known to an attacker."
