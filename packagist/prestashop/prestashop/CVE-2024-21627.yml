package_slug: "packagist/prestashop/prestashop"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "PrestaShop is an open-source e-commerce platform. Prior to versions
  8.1.3 and 1.7.8.11, some event attributes are not detected by the `isCleanHTML`
  method. Some modules using the `isCleanHTML` method could be vulnerable to cross-site
  scripting. Versions 8.1.3 and 1.7.8.11 contain a patch for this issue. The best
  workaround is to use the `HTMLPurifier` library to sanitize html input coming from
  users. The library is already available as a dependency in the PrestaShop project.
  Beware though that in legacy object models, fields of `HTML` type will call `isCleanHTML`."
