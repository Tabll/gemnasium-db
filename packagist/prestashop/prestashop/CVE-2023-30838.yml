package_slug: "packagist/prestashop/prestashop"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "PrestaShop is an Open Source e-commerce web application. Prior to versions
  8.0.4 and 1.7.8.9, the `ValidateCore::isCleanHTML()` method of Prestashop misses
  hijackable events which can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) injection, allowed
  by the presence of pre-setup `@keyframes` methods. This XSS, which hijacks HTML
  attributes, can be triggered without any interaction by the visitor/administrator,
  which makes it as dangerous as a trivial XSS attack. Contrary to other attacks which
  target HTML attributes and are triggered without user interaction (such as onload
  / onerror which suffer from a very limited scope), this one can hijack every HTML
  element, which increases the danger due to a complete HTML elements scope. Versions
  8.0.4 and 1.7.8.9 contain a fix for this issue."
