package_slug: "packagist/prestashop/prestashop"
title: "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
description: "PrestaShop is an open source e-commerce web application that, prior
  to version 8.0.1, is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF). When authenticating
  users, PrestaShop preserves session attributes. Because this does not clear CSRF
  tokens upon login, this might enable same-site attackers to bypass the CSRF protection
  mechanism by performing an attack similar to a session-fixation. The problem is
  fixed in version 8.0.1."
