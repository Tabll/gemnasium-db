package_slug: "packagist/prestashop/prestashop"
title: "Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')"
description: "In the orders section of PrestaShop before 1.7.2.5, an attack is possible
  after gaining access to a target store with a user role with the rights of at least
  a Salesman or higher privileges. The attacker can then inject arbitrary PHP objects
  into the process and abuse an object chain in order to gain Remote Code Execution.
  This occurs because protection against serialized objects looks for a 0: followed
  by an integer, but does not consider 0:+ followed by an integer."
