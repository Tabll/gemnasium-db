package_slug: "packagist/prestashop/prestashop"
title: "PrestaShop cross-site scripting via customer contact form in FO, through file
  upload"
description: "Only PrestaShops with customer-thread feature flag enabled are impacted,
  starting from PrestaShop 8.1.0.\n\nThe impact is substantial, when the customer
  thread feature flag is enabled, through the front-office contact form, a hacker
  can upload a malicious file containing an XSS that will be executed when an admin
  opens the attached file in back office.\n\nConsequence: the script injected can
  access the session and the security token, which allows it to perform any authenticated
  action in the scope of the administrator's right."
