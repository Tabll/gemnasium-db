title: "Passbolt Api Retrieval of HTTP-only cookies"
description: "Passbolt uses three cookies: a session cookie, a CSRF protection cookie
  and a cookie to keep track of the multiple-factor authentication process.\n\nBoth
  the session cookie and the mfa cookie are properly set HTTP-only to prevent an attacker
  from retrieving the content of those cookies if they managed to exploit an XSS.\n\nThe
  /auth/verify.json endpoint returns a JSON that, among other things, contains the
  cookies sent in the request. (similar to the TRACE HTTP method)\n\nAn attacker who
  manages to leverage an XSS vulnerability could retrieve the session cookies of a
  legitimate user, effectively granting them the ability to retrieve information (such
  as encrypted password list or group list) without requiring user interaction.\n\nThis
  vulnerability has a low impact, but no immediate risk due to it requiring the exploitation
  of an XSS vulnerability that has yet to be found."
