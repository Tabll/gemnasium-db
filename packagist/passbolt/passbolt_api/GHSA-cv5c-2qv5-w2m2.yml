title: "Passbolt Api Remote code execution"
description: "Passbolt provides a way for system administrators to generate a PGP
  key for the server during installation. The wizard requests a username, an e-mail
  address and an optional comment. No escaping or verification is done by Passbolt,
  effectively allowing a user to inject bash code.\n\nThe impact is very high, but
  the probability is very low given that this vulnerability can only be exploited
  during Passboltâ€™s installation stage."
