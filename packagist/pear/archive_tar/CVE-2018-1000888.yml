identifier: "CVE-2018-1000888"
package_slug: "packagist/pear/archive_tar"
title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "There are several file operations with `$v_header['filename']` as parameter
  (such as file_exists, is_file, is_dir, etc). When extract is called without a specific
  prefix path, we can trigger unserialization by crafting a tar file with `phar://[path_to_malicious_phar_file]`
  as path. Object injection can be used to trigger destruct in the loaded PHP classes,
  e.g. the Archive_Tar class itself. With Archive_Tar object injection, arbitrary
  file deletion can occur because `@unlink($this->_temp_tarname)` is called. If another
  class with useful gadget is loaded, it may possible to cause remote code execution
  that can result in files being deleted or possibly modified."
