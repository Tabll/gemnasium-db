package_slug: "packagist/concrete5/core"
title: "Path traversal in Concrete CMS"
description: "Concrete 8.5.7 and below as well as Concrete 9.0 through 9.0.2 allow
  traversal in /index.php/ccm/system/file/upload which could result in an Arbitrary
  File Delete exploit. This was remediated by sanitizing /index.php/ccm/system/file/upload
  to ensure Concrete doesnâ€™t allow traversal and by changing isFullChunkFilePresent
  to have an early false return when input does not match expectations.Concrete CMS
  Security team ranked this 5.8 with CVSS v3.1 vector AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H.
