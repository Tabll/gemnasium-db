title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command
  Injection')"
description: "Concrete CMS Versions 9.0.0 through 9.0.2 and 8.5.7 and below can download
  zip files over HTTP and execute code from those zip files which could lead to an
  RCE. Fixed by enforcing ‘concrete_secure’ instead of ‘concrete’. Concrete now only
  makes requests over https even a request comes in via http. Concrete CMS security
  team ranked this 8 with CVSS v3.1 vector: AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H Credit
