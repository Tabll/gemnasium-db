description: "Concrete CMS (formerly concrete5) versions below 8.5.7 has a SSRF mitigation
  bypass using DNS Rebind attack giving an attacker the ability to fetch cloud IAAS
  (ex AWS) IAM keys.To fix this Concrete CMS no longer allows downloads from the local
  network and specifies the validated IP when downloading rather than relying on DNS.Discoverer:
  Adrian Tiron from FORTBRIDGE ( https://www.fortbridge.co.uk/ )The Concrete CMS team
  gave this a CVSS 3.1 score of 3.5 AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N . Please note
  that Cloud IAAS provider mis-configurations are not Concrete CMS vulnerabilities.
  A mitigation for this vulnerability is to make sure that the IMDS configurations
  are according to a cloud provider's best practices.This fix is also in Concrete
  version 9.0.0"
