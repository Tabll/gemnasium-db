title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "XSS in /dashboard/blocks/stacks/view_details/ - old browsers only. When
  using an older browser with built-in XSS protection disabled, insufficient sanitation
  where built urls are outputted can be exploited for Concrete 8.5.7 and below as
  well as Concrete 9.0 through 9.0.2 to allow XSS. This cannot be exploited in modern-day
  web browsers due to an automatic input escape mechanism. Concrete CMS Security team
  ranked this vulnerability 3.1with CVSS v3.1 Vector AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N.
  Sanitation has been added where built urls are output. Credit to Credit to Bogdan
