title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "Concrete CMS version 9 before 9.2.5 is vulnerable to  stored XSS via
  the Role Name field since there is insufficient validation of administrator provided
  data for that field. A rogue administrator could inject malicious code into the
  Role Name field which might be executed when users visit the affected page. The
  Concrete CMS Security team scored this 2 with CVSS v3 vector AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
  https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator . Concrete versions below 9
  do not include group types so they are not affected by this vulnerability. \n"
