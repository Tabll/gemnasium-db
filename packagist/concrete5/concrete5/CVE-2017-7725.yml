package_slug: "packagist/concrete5/concrete5"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "concrete5 8.1.0 places incorrect trust in the HTTP Host header during
  caching, if the administrator does not define a \"canonical\" URL on installation
  of concrete5 using the \"Advanced Options\" settings. Remote attackers can make
  a GET request with any domain name in the Host header; this is stored and allows
  for arbitrary domains to be set for certain links displayed to subsequent visitors,
  potentially an XSS vector."
