title: "Concrete CMS Stored Cross-site Scripting vulnerability"
description: "Concrete CMS version 9 before 9.2.7 is vulnerable to Stored XSS via
  the Name field of a Group type since there is insufficient validation of administrator
  provided data for that field. A rogue administrator could inject malicious code
  into the Name field which might be executed when users visit the affected page.
  The Concrete CMS security team gave this vulnerability a CVSS v3.1 score of 2.2
  with a vector of AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N  Concrete versions below 9
  do not include group types so they are not affected by this vulnerability. Thanks
  Luca Fuda for reporting.\n"
