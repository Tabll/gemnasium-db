description: "Concrete CMS (formerly concrete5) below 8.5.10 and between 9.0.0 and
  9.1.2 is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in dashboard/system/express/entities/associations
  because Concrete CMS allows association with an entity name that doesnâ€™t exist or,
  if it does exist, contains XSS since it was not properly sanitized. Remediate by
  updating to Concrete CMS 9.1.3+ or 8.5.10+."
