title: "Concrete CMS Vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and Cross-Site
  Scripting (XSS)"
description: "Concrete CMS version 9 below 9.4.0RC2 and versions below 8.5.20 are
  vulnerable to CSRF and XSS in the Concrete CMS Address attribute because addresses
  are not properly sanitized in the output when a country is not specified.  Attackers
  are limited to individuals whom a site administrator has granted the ability to
  fill in an address attribute. It is possible for the attacker to glean limited information
  from the site but amount and type is restricted by mitigating controls and the level
  of access of the attacker. Limited data modification is possible. The dashboard
  page itself could be rendered unavailable.\nThe fix only sanitizes new data uploaded
  post update to Concrete CMS 9.4.0RC2. Existing database entries added before the
  update will still be “live” if there were successful exploits added under previous
  versions; a database search is recommended. The Concrete CMS security team gave
  this vulnerability CVSS v.4.0 score of 5.1  with vector CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:P/VC:L/VI:L/VA:L/SC:L/SI:L/SA:L Thanks
  Myq Larson for reporting."
