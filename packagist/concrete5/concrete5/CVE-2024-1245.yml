package_slug: "packagist/concrete5/concrete5"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "Concrete CMSÂ version 9 before 9.2.5 is vulnerable to stored XSS in file
  tags and description attributes since administrator entered file attributes are
  not sufficiently sanitized in the Edit Attributes page. A rogue administrator could
  put malicious code into the file tags or description attributes and, when another
  administrator opens the same file for editing, the malicious code could execute.
  The Concrete CMS Security team scored this 2.4 with CVSS v3 vector AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N.
