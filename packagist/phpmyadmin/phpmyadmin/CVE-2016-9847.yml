identifier: "CVE-2016-9847"
package_slug: "packagist/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin"
title: "Cryptographic Issues"
description: "An issue was discovered in phpMyAdmin. When the user does not specify
  a `blowfish_secret` key for encrypting cookies, phpMyAdmin generates one at runtime.
  A vulnerability was reported where the way this value is created uses a weak algorithm.
  This could allow an attacker to determine the user's `blowfish_secret` and potentially
  decrypt their cookies."
