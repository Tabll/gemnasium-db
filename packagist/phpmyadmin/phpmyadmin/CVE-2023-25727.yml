title: "Cross-site Scripting vulnerability in drag-and-drop upload of phpMyAdmin"
description: "In phpMyAdmin before 4.9.11 and 5.x before 5.2.1, an authenticated user
  can trigger Cross-site Scripting (XSS) by uploading a crafted .sql file through
  the drag-and-drop interface. By disabling the configuration directive `$cfg['enable_drag_drop_import']`,
  users will be unable to use the drag and drop upload which would protect against
  the vulnerability."
