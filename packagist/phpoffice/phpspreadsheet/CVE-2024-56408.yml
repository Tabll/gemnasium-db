  Research\n\nThe researcher discovered zero-day vulnerability Unauthorized Reflected
  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (in `Convert-Online.php` file) in Phpspreadsheet.\n\nThere
  is no sanitization in the `/vendor/phpoffice/phpspreadsheet/samples/Engineering/Convert-Online.php`
  file, which leads to the possibility of a XSS attack.\n\n![fig4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71a6ab8b-db65-4e7e-bb36-39f0bd0f7077)\n\n*Figure
  4. The message with the quantity parameter is displayed without sanitization*\n\n\nThe
  following figure shows a POST HTTP-request and a response to the server with the
  variable quantity, which is displayed in the response from the server without sanitization.\n\n<img

  />\n\n*Figure 5. In the server's response , the quantity variable is displayed without
  sanitization*\n\nAn attacker can prepare a special HTML form that will be automatically
  sent to the vulnerable scenario.\n\n*Listing 3. HTML form that demonstrates the
