title: "PhpSpreadsheet allows absolute path traversal and Server-Side Request Forgery
  in HTML writer when embedding images is enabled"
description: "It's possible for an attacker to construct an XLSX file that links images
  from arbitrary paths. When embedding images has been enabled in HTML writer with
  `$writer->setEmbedImages(true);` those files will be included in the output as `data:`
  URLs, regardless of the file's type. Also URLs can be used for embedding, resulting
  in a Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability."
