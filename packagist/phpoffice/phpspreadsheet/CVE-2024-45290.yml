title: "PhpSpreadsheet allows absolute path traversal and Server-Side Request Forgery
  when opening XLSX file"
description: "It's possible for an attacker to construct an XLSX file which links
  media from external URLs. When opening the XLSX file, PhpSpreadsheet retrieves the
  image size and type by reading the file contents, if the provided path is a URL.
  By using specially crafted `php://filter` URLs an attacker can leak the contents
  of any file or URL."
