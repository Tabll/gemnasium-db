identifier: "CVE-2019-12331"
package_slug: "packagist/phpoffice/phpspreadsheet"
title: "Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference"
description: "PHPOffice `PhpSpreadsheet` has an XXE issue. The `XmlScanner` decodes
  the `sheet1.xml` from an `.xlsx` to utf-8 if something else than UTF-8 is declared
  in the header. This was a security measurement to prevent CVE-2018-19277 but the
  fix is not sufficient. By double-encoding the the xml payload to utf-7 it is possible
  to bypass the check for the string `?<!ENTITY?` and thus allowing for an xml external
  entity processing (XXE) attack."
