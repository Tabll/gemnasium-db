title: "PhpSpreadsheet allows unauthorized Reflected XSS in the Accounting.php file"
description: "# Unauthorized Reflected XSS in the `Accounting.php` file\n\n**Product**:
  Phpspreadsheet\n**Version**: version 3.6.0\n**CWE-ID**: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization
  of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**CVSS vector v.3.1**:
  8.2 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N)\n**CVSS vector v.4.0**: 8.3 (AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:L/SI:H/SA:L)\n**Description**:
  using the `/vendor/phpoffice/phpspreadsheet/samples/Wizards/NumberFormat/Accounting.php`
  script, an attacker can perform a XSS-type attack\n**Impact**: executing arbitrary
  JavaScript code in the browser\n**Vulnerable component**: the `/vendor/phpoffice/phpspreadsheet/samples/Wizards/NumberFormat/Accounting.php`
  file\n**Exploitation conditions**: an unauthorized user\n**Mitigation**: sanitization
  of the currency variable\n**Researcher**: Aleksey Solovev (Positive Technologies)\n\n#
  Research\n\nThe researcher discovered zero-day vulnerability Unauthorized Reflected
  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (in `Accounting.php` file) in Phpspreadsheet.\n\nThere
  is no sanitization in the `/vendor/phpoffice/phpspreadsheet/samples/Wizards/NumberFormat/Accounting.php`
  file, which leads to the possibility of a XSS attack.\nStrings are formed using
  the currency parameter without sanitization, which is controlled by the attacker.\n\n![fig7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da0ee52d-2306-4770-a61d-bce4ba553f4f)\n\n*Figure
  7. A fragment of the query in which a string and a parameter are formed without
  sanitization*\n\nAn attacker can prepare a special HTML form that will be automatically
  sent to the vulnerable scenario.\n\n*Listing 4. HTML form that demonstrates the
  exploitation of the XSS vulnerability*"
