title: "nzo/url-encryptor-bundle Insecure default secret key and IV allowing anyone
  to decrypt values"
description: "Versions of nzo/url-encryptor-bundle prior to 5.0.1 and 4.3.2 are affected
  by a security vulnerability related to the lack of mandatory key and IV requirements.
  By default, the bundle uses the aes-256-ctr algorithm, which is susceptible to malleability
  attacks, potentially leading to Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerabilities.
  Additionally, the reuse of keys enables users to decrypt and modify encrypted data
  if they can guess the plaintext of one ciphertext."
