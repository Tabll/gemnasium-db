package_slug: "packagist/yiisoft/yii2"
title: "Unsafe Reflection in base Component class in yiisoft/yii2"
description: "Yii2 supports attaching Behaviors to Components by setting properties
  having the format `'as <behaviour-name>'`.\n\nInternally this is done using the
  `__set()` magic method. If the value passed to this method is not an instance of
  the `Behavior` class, a new object is instantiated using `Yii::createObject($value)`.
  However, there is no validation check that verifies that `$value` is a valid `Behavior`
  class name or configuration. An attacker that can control the content of the $value
  variable can then instantiate arbitrary classes, passing parameters to their constructors
  and then invoking setter methods."
