package_slug: "packagist/opencart/opencart"
title: "Cross site scripting in opencart"
description: "This affects versions of the package opencart/opencart from 4.0.0.0.
  A reflected XSS issue was identified in the directory parameter of admin common/filemanager.list
  route. An attacker could obtain a user's token by tricking the user to click on
  a maliciously crafted URL. The user is then prompted to login and redirected again
  upon authentication with the payload automatically executing. If the attacked user
  has admin privileges, this vulnerability could be used as the start of a chain of
  exploits like Zip Slip or arbitrary file write vulnerabilities in the admin functionality.\n\n**Notes:**\n\n1)
  This is only exploitable if the attacker knows the name or path of the admin directory.
  The name of the directory is \"admin\" by default but there is a pop-up in the dashboard
  warning users to rename it.\n\n2) The fix for this vulnerability is incomplete.
  The redirect is removed so that it is not possible for an attacker to control the
  redirect post admin login anymore, but it is still possible to exploit this issue
  in admin if the user is authenticated as an admin already."
