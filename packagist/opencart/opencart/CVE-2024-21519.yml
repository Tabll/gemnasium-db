title: "Arbitrary File Creation in opencart"
description: "This affects versions of the package opencart/opencart from 4.0.0.0.
  An Arbitrary File Creation issue was identified via the database restoration functionality.
  By injecting PHP code into the database, an attacker with admin privileges can create
  a backup file with an arbitrary filename (including the extension), within /system/storage/backup.\n\n**Note:**\n\nIt
  is less likely for the created file to be available within the web root, as part
  of the security recommendations for the application suggest moving the storage path
  outside of the web root."
