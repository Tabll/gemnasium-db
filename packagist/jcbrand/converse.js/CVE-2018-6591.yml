package_slug: "packagist/jcbrand/converse.js"
title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "Converse.js and Inverse.js through 3.3 allow remote attackers to obtain
  sensitive information because it is too difficult to determine whether safe publication
  of private data was configured or even intended. For example, users might have an
  expectation that chatroom bookmarks are private, but the various interacting software
  components do not necessarily make that happen."
