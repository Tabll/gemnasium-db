title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "FriendsofFlarum (FoF) Upload is an extension that handles file uploads
  intelligently for your forum. If FoF Upload prior to version 1.2.3 is configured
  to allow the uploading of SVG files (`image/svg+xml`), navigating directly to an
  SVG file URI could execute arbitrary Javascript code decided by an attacker. This
  Javascript code could include the execution of HTTP web requests to Flarum, or any
  other web service. This could allow data to be leaked by an authenticated Flarum
  user, or, possibly, for data to be modified maliciously. This issue has been patched
  with v1.2.3, which now sanitizes uploaded SVG files. As a workaround, remove the
  ability for users to upload SVG files through FoF Upload."
