title: "Apache Lucene.Net.Replicator Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability"
description: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability in Apache Lucene.Net.Replicator.\n\nThis
  issue affects Apache Lucene.NET's Replicator library: from 4.8.0-beta00005 through
  4.8.0-beta00016.\n\nAn attacker that can intercept traffic between a replication
  client and server, or control the target replication node URL, can provide a specially-crafted
  JSON response that is deserialized as an attacker-provided exception type. This
  can result in remote code execution or other potential unauthorized access.\n\nUsers
  are recommended to upgrade to version 4.8.0-beta00017, which fixes the issue."
