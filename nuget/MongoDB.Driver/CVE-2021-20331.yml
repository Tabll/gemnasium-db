package_slug: "nuget/MongoDB.Driver"
title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "Specific versions of the MongoDB C# Driver may erroneously publish events
  containing authentication-related data to a command listener configured by an application.
  The published events may contain security-sensitive data when commands such as \"saslStart\",
  \"saslContinue\", \"isMaster\", \"createUser\", and \"updateUser\" are executed.
  Without due care, an application may inadvertently expose this authenticated-related
  information, e.g., by writing it to a log file. This issue only arises if an application
  enables the command listener feature (this is not enabled by default). This issue
  affects the MongoDB C# Driver 2.12 <= 2.12.1."
