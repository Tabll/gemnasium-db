package_slug: "nuget/TinyMCE"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "TinyMCE is an open source rich text editor. A mutation cross-site scripting
  (mXSS) vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCEâ€™s core undo/redo functionality and
  other APIs and plugins. Text nodes within specific parents are not escaped upon
  serialization according to the HTML standard. If such text nodes contain a special
  character reserved as an internal marker, they can be combined with other HTML patterns
  to form malicious snippets. These snippets pass the initial sanitisation layer when
  the content is parsed into the editor body, but can trigger XSS when the special
  internal marker is removed from the content and re-parsed. his vulnerability has
  been patched in TinyMCE versions 6.7.3 and 5.10.9. Users are advised to upgrade.
  There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
