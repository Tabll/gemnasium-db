title: "Akka.Remote TLS did not properly implement certificate-based authentication"
description: "This is a critical network security vulnerability for Akka.Remote **users
  who have SSL / TLS enabled** on their Akka.Remote connections and were expecting
  certificate-based authentication to be enforced on all peers attempting to join
  the network.\n\nIn all versions of Akka.Remote from v1.2.0 to v1.5.51, TLS could
  be enabled via our `akka.remote.dot-netty.tcp` transport and this would correctly
  enforce private key validation on the server-side of inbound connections. Akka.Remote,
  however, never asked the outbound-connecting client to present ITS certificate -
  therefore it's possible for untrusted parties to connect to a private key'd Akka.NET
  cluster and begin communicating with it **without any certificate**.\n\nThe issue
  here is that for certificate-based authentication to work properly, ensuring that
  all members of the Akka.Remote network are secured with the same private key, Akka.Remote
  needed to implement mutual TLS. This was not the case before Akka.NET v1.5.52.\n\nIf
  you are running Akka.NET inside a private network you fully control or you were
  never using TLS in the first place, then this bug has no impact on you. However:
  if you are using TLS to secure your network YOU MUST upgrade to Akka.NET V1.5.52
  or later."
