title: "Sustainsys.Saml2 Insufficient Identity Provider Issuer Validation"
description: "When a response is processed, the issuer of the Identity Provider is
  not sufficiently validated. This could allow a malicious identity provider to craft
  a Saml2 response that is processed as if issued by another identity provider. It
  is also possible for a malicious end user to cause stored state intended for one
  identity provider to be used when processing the response from another provider.\n\nAn
  application is impacted if they rely on any of these features in their authentication/authorization
  logic:\n* the issuer of the generated identity and claims\n* items in the stored
  request state (AuthenticationProperties)"
