title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "Jellyfin is a free-software media system. Versions starting with 10.8.0
  and prior to 10.8.10 and prior have a directory traversal vulnerability inside the
  `ClientLogController`, specifically `/ClientLog/Document`. When combined with a
  cross-site scripting vulnerability (CVE-2023-30627), this can result in file write
  and arbitrary code execution. Version 10.8.10 has a patch for this issue. There
  are no known workarounds."
