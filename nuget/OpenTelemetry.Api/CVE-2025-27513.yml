title: "OpenTelemetry .NET has Denial of Service (DoS) Vulnerability in API Package"
description: "_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nA vulnerability
  in `OpenTelemetry.Api` package `1.10.0` to `1.11.1` could cause a Denial of Service
  (DoS) when a `tracestate` and `traceparent` header is received.\n\n* Even if an
  application does not explicitly use trace context propagation, receiving these headers
  can still trigger high CPU usage.\n* This issue impacts any application accessible
  over the web or backend services that process HTTP requests containing a `tracestate`
  header.\n* Application may experience excessive resource consumption, leading to
  increased latency, degraded performance, or downtime."
