title: "The Umbraco Heartcore headless client library uses a vulnerable Refit dependency
  package"
description: "The Heartcore headless client library depends on [Refit ](https://github.com/reactiveui/refit)
  to assist in making HTTP requests to Heartcore public APIs. Refit recently published
  an advisory regarding a CRLF injection vulnerability whereby it is possible for
  a malicious user to smuggle additional headers or potentially body content into
  a request.\n\nThis shouldn't affect Heartcore client library usage as the vulnerable
  method - `HttpHeaders.TryAddWithoutValidation` - is not used. However, since Refit
  is a transient dependency for applications using this library, then any users making
  direct use of Refit could be vulnerable."
