package_slug: "nuget/Wasmtime"
title: "Access of Uninitialized Pointer"
description: "Wasmtime is an open source runtime for WebAssembly & WASI. Prior to
  versions 0.34.1 and 0.33.1, there exists a bug in the pooling instance allocator
  in Wasmtime's runtime where a failure to instantiate an instance for a module that
  defines an `externref` global will result in an invalid drop of a `VMExternRef`
  via an uninitialized pointer. A number of conditions listed in the GitHub Security
  Advisory must be true in order for an instance to be vulnerable to this issue. Maintainers
  believe that the effective impact of this bug is relatively small because the usage
  of `externref` is still uncommon and without a resource limiter configured on the
  `Store`, which is not the default configuration, it is only possible to trigger
  the bug from an error returned by `mprotect` or `VirtualAlloc`. Note that on Linux
  with the `uffd` feature enabled, it is only possible to trigger the bug from a resource
  limiter as the call to `mprotect` is skipped. The bug has been fixed in 0.34.1 and
  0.33.1 and users are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible. If it is not possible
  to upgrade to version 0.34.1 or 0.33.1 of the `wasmtime` crate, it is recommend
  that support for the reference types proposal be disabled by passing `false` to
  `Config::wasm_reference_types`. Doing so will prevent modules that use `externref`
  from being loaded entirely."
