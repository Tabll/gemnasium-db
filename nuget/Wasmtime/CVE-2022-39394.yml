package_slug: "nuget/Wasmtime"
title: "Out-of-bounds Write"
description: "Wasmtime is a standalone runtime for WebAssembly. Prior to version 2.0.2,
  there is a bug in Wasmtime's C API implementation where the definition of the `wasmtime_trap_code`
  does not match its declared signature in the `wasmtime/trap.h` header file. This
  discrepancy causes the function implementation to perform a 4-byte write into a
  1-byte buffer provided by the caller. This can lead to three zero bytes being written
  beyond the 1-byte location provided by the caller. This bug has been patched and
  users should upgrade to Wasmtime 2.0.2. This bug can be worked around by providing
  a 4-byte buffer casted to a 1-byte buffer when calling `wasmtime_trap_code`. Users
  of the `wasmtime` crate are not affected by this issue, only users of the C API
  function `wasmtime_trap_code` are affected."
