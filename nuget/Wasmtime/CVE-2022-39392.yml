package_slug: "nuget/Wasmtime"
title: "Out-of-bounds Write"
description: "Wasmtime is a standalone runtime for WebAssembly. Prior to version 2.0.2,
  there is a bug in Wasmtime's implementation of its pooling instance allocator when
  the allocator is configured to give WebAssembly instances a maximum of zero pages
  of memory. In this configuration, the virtual memory mapping for WebAssembly memories
  does not meet the compiler-required configuration requirements for safely executing
  WebAssembly modules. Wasmtime's default settings require virtual memory page faults
  to indicate that wasm reads/writes are out-of-bounds, but the pooling allocator's
  configuration would not create an appropriate virtual memory mapping for this meaning
  out-of-bounds reads/writes can successfully read/write memory unrelated to the wasm
  sandbox within range of the base address of the memory mapping created by the pooling
  allocator. This bug is not applicable with the default settings of the `wasmtime`
  crate. This bug can only be triggered by setting `InstanceLimits::memory_pages`
  to zero. This is expected to be a very rare configuration since this means that
  wasm modules cannot allocate any pages of linear memory. All wasm modules produced
  by all current toolchains are highly likely to use linear memory, so it's expected
  to be unlikely that this configuration is set to zero by any production embedding
  of Wasmtime. This bug has been patched and users should upgrade to Wasmtime 2.0.2.
  This bug can be worked around by increasing the `memory_pages` allotment when configuring
  the pooling allocator to a value greater than zero. If an embedding wishes to still
  prevent memory from actually being used then the `Store::limiter` method can be
  used to dynamically disallow growth of memory beyond 0 bytes large. Note that the
  default `memory_pages` value is greater than zero."
