package_slug: "nuget/Wasmtime"
title: "Incorrect Calculation"
description: "Wasmtime is a standalone runtime for WebAssembly. There is a bug in
  Wasmtime's code generator, Cranelift, for AArch64 targets where constant divisors
  can result in incorrect division results at runtime. This affects Wasmtime prior
  to version 0.38.2 and Cranelift prior to 0.85.2. This issue only affects the AArch64
  platform. Other platforms are not affected. The translation rules for constants
  does not take into account whether sign or zero-extension should happen which resulted
  in an incorrect value being placed into a register when a division was encountered.
  The impact of this bug is that programs executing within the WebAssembly sandbox
  would not behave according to the WebAssembly specification. This means that it
  is hypothetically possible for execution within the sandbox to go awry and WebAssembly
  programs could produce unexpected results. This should not impact hosts executing
  WebAssembly but does affect the correctness of guest programs. This bug has been
  patched in Wasmtime version 0.38.2 and cranelift-codegen 0.85.2. There are no known
  workarounds."
