package_slug: "nuget/Wasmtime"
title: "Off-by-one Error"
description: "Wasmtime is a standalone runtime for WebAssembly. Wasmtime versions
  from 10.0.0 to versions 10.02, 11.0.2, and 12.0.1 contain a miscompilation of the
  WebAssembly `i64x2.shr_s` instruction on x86_64 platforms when the shift amount
  is a constant value that is larger than 32. Only x86_64 is affected so all other
  targets are not affected by this. The miscompilation results in the instruction
  producing an incorrect result, namely the low 32-bits of the second lane of the
  vector are derived from the low 32-bits of the second lane of the input vector instead
  of the high 32-bits. The primary impact of this issue is that any WebAssembly program
  using the `i64x2.shr_s` with a constant shift amount larger than 32 may produce
  an incorrect result.\n\nThis issue is not an escape from the WebAssembly sandbox.
  Execution of WebAssembly guest programs will still behave correctly with respect
  to memory sandboxing and isolation from the host. Wasmtime considers non-spec-compliant
  behavior as a security issue nonetheless.\n\nThis issue was discovered through fuzzing
  of Wasmtime's code generator Cranelift.\n\nWasmtime versions 10.0.2, 11.0.2, and
  12.0.2 are all patched to no longer have this miscompilation. This issue only affects
  x86_64 hosts and the only workaround is to either scan for this pattern in wasm
  modules which is nontrivial or to disable the SIMD proposal for WebAssembly. Users
  prior to 10.0.0 are unaffected by this vulnerability."
