title: "Denial of service in CBOR library"
description: "### Impact\nDue to this library's use of an inefficient algorithm, it
  is vulnerable to a denial of service attack when a maliciously crafted input is
  passed to `DecodeFromBytes` or other CBOR decoding mechanisms in this library.\n\nAffected
  versions _include_ versions 4.0.0 through 4.5.0.\n\nThis vulnerability was privately
  reported to me.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue has been fixed in version 4.5.1.  Users
  should use the latest version of this library. (The latest version is not necessarily
  4.5.1.  Check the [NuGet page](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PeterO.Cbor) to see
  the latest version's version number.)\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAgain, users should
  use the latest version of this library.\n\nIn the meantime, note that the inputs
  affected by this issue are all CBOR maps or contain CBOR maps.  An input that decodes
  to a single CBOR object is not capable of containing a CBOR map if&mdash;\n\n- it
  begins with a byte other than 0x80 through 0xDF, or\n- it does not contain a byte
  in the range 0xa0 through 0xBF.\n\nSuch an input is not affected by this vulnerability
  and an application can choose to perform this check before passing it to a CBOR
  decoding mechanism.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments
  about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [the CBOR repository](https://github.com/peteroupc/CBOR).\n"
