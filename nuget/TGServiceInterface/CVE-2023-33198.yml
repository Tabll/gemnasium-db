title: "Incorrectly Specified Chat Message Destinations in tgstation-server and DreamMaker API"
description: "tgstation-server is a production scale tool for BYOND server management.
  The DreamMaker API (DMAPI) chat channel cache can possibly be poisoned by a tgstation-server
  (TGS) restart and reattach. This can result in sending chat messages to one of any
  of the configured IRC or Discord channels for the instance on enabled chat bots.
  This lasts until the instance's chat channels are updated in TGS or DreamDaemon
  is restarted. TGS chat commands are unaffected, custom or otherwise.\n"
