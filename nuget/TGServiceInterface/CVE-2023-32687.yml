title: "Insufficiently Protected Credentials"
description: "tgstation-server is a toolset to manage production BYOND servers. Starting
  in version 4.7.0 and prior to 5.12.1, instance users with the list chat bots permission
  can read chat bot connections strings without the associated permission. This issue
  is patched in version 5.12.1. As a workaround, remove the list chat bots permission
  from users that should not have the ability to view connection strings. Invalidate
  any credentials previously stored for safety."
