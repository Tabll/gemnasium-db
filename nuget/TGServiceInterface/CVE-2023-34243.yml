package_slug: "nuget/TGServiceInterface"
title: "Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts"
description: "TGstation is a toolset to manage production BYOND servers. In affected
  versions if a Windows user was registered in tgstation-server (TGS), an attacker
  could discover their username by brute-forcing the login endpoint with an invalid
  password. When a valid Windows logon was found, a distinct response would be generated.
  This issue has been addressed in version 5.12.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users
  unable to upgrade may be mitigated by rate-limiting API calls with software that
  sits in front of TGS in the HTTP pipeline such as fail2ban."
