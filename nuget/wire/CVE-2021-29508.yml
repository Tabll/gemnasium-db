package_slug: "nuget/wire"
title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "Due to how Wire handles type information in its serialization format,
  malicious payloads can be passed to a deserializer. e.g. using a surrogate on the
  sender end, an attacker can pass information about a different type for the receiving
  end. And by doing so allowing the serializer to create any type on the deserializing
  end. This is the same issue that exists for .NET BinaryFormatter https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/code-quality/ca2300?view=vs-2019.
  This also applies to the fork of Wire."
