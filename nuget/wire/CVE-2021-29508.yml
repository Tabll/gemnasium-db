identifier: "CVE-2021-29508"
package_slug: "nuget/wire"
title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "Due to how Wire handles type information in its serialization format,
  malicious payloads can be passed to a deserializer. e.g. using a surrogate on the
  sender end, an attacker can pass information about a different type for the receiving
  end. And by doing so allowing the serializer to create any type on the deserializing
  end."
