package_slug: "nuget/Sustainsys.Saml2"
title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "In Saml2 Authentication Services for ASP.NET, and between, there is
  a vulnerability in how tokens are validated in some cases. Saml2 tokens are usually
  used as bearer tokens - a caller that presents a token is assumed to be the subject
  of the token. There is also support in the Saml2 protocol for issuing tokens that
  is tied to a subject through other means, e.g. holder-of-key where possession of
  a private key must be proved. The Sustainsys.Saml2 library incorrectly treats all
  incoming tokens as bearer tokens, even though they have another subject confirmation
  method specified. This could be used by an attacker that could get access to Saml2
  tokens with another subject confirmation method than bearer. The attacker could
  then use such a token to create a log in session."
