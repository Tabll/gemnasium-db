package_slug: "nuget/Moment.js"
title: "Path Traversal: 'dir/../../filename'"
description: "Moment.js is a JavaScript date library for parsing, validating, manipulating,
  and formatting dates. A path traversal vulnerability impacts npm (server) users
  of Moment.js between versions 1.0.1 and 2.29.1, especially if a user-provided locale
  string is directly used to switch moment locale. This problem is patched in 2.29.2,
  and the patch can be applied to all affected versions. As a workaround, sanitize
  the user-provided locale name before passing it to Moment.js."
