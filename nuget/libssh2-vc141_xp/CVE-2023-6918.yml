package_slug: "nuget/libssh2-vc141_xp"
title: "Unchecked Return Value"
description: "A flaw was found in the libssh implements abstract layer for message
  digest (MD) operations implemented by different supported crypto backends. The return
  values from these were not properly checked, which could cause low-memory situations
  failures, NULL dereferences, crashes, or usage of the uninitialized memory as an
  input for the KDF. In this case, non-matching keys will result in decryption/integrity
  failures, terminating the connection."
