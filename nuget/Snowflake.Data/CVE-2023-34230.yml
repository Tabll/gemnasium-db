package_slug: "nuget/Snowflake.Data"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')"
description: "snowflake-connector-net, the Snowflake Connector for .NET, is vulnerable
  to command injection prior to version 2.0.18 via SSO URL authentication. In order
  to exploit the potential for command injection, an attacker would need to be successful
  in (1) establishing a malicious resource and (2) redirecting users to utilize the
  resource. The attacker could set up a malicious, publicly accessible server which
  responds to the SSO URL with an attack payload. If the attacker then tricked a user
  into visiting the maliciously crafted connection URL, the userâ€™s local machine would
  render the malicious payload, leading to a remote code execution. This attack scenario
  can be mitigated through URL allow listing as well as common anti-phishing resources.
  Version 2.0.18 fixes this issue."
