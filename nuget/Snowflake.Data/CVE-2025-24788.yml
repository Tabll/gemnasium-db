package_slug: "nuget/Snowflake.Data"
title: "Snowflake.Data has weak temporary files permissions"
description: "### Issue\nSnowflake discovered and remediated a vulnerability in the
  Snowflake Connector for .NET in which files downloaded from stages are temporarily
  placed in a world-readable local directory, making them accessible to unauthorized
  users on the same machine.\n\nThis vulnerability affects versions 2.0.12 through
  4.2.0 on Linux and macOS. Snowflake fixed the issue in version 4.3.0.\n\n### Vulnerability
  Details\nWhen downloading files from stages, the Snowflake Connector for .NET uses
  the OS temporary directory to save files before copying them to the destination
  directory. The files in the temporary directory, which are removed once the write
  to the destination directory concludes, have world-readable permissions on Linux
  and macOS. This could allow any user on the local machine to access them during
  their limited lifetime.\n\n### Solution\nSnowflake released version 4.3.0 of the
  Snowflake Connector for .NET, which fixes this issue. We recommend users upgrade
  to version 4.3.0.\n\n### Additional Information\nIf you discover a security vulnerability
  in one of our products or websites, please report the issue to HackerOne. For more
  information, please see our [Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://hackerone.com/snowflake?type=team)."
