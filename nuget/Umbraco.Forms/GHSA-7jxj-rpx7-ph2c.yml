title: "Umbraco.Forms CDN may cache sensitive form uploads when processed by ImageSharp"
description: "Protected files uploaded through Umbraco Forms may be served to unauthenticated
  users when a CDN or caching layer is present and ImageSharp processes the request.
  ImageSharp sets aggressive cache headers by default, which can cause intermediary
  caches to store and serve files that should require authentication."
