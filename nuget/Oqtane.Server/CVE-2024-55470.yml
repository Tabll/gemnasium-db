title: "Oqtane Framework Incorrect Access Control vulnerability"
description: "Oqtane Framework 6.0.0 is vulnerable to Incorrect Access Control. By

  successfully log into the application or access restricted data without proper authorization.
  The lack of server-side validation exacerbates the issue, as the application relies
  on client-side information for authentication."
