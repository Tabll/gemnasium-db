package_slug: "nuget/SharpZipLib"
title: "Path traversal in SharpZipLib"
description: "SharpZipLib (or #ziplib) is a Zip, GZip, Tar and BZip2 library. A check
  was added if the destination file is under destination directory. However, it is
  not enforced that `destDir` ends with slash. If the `destDir` is not slash terminated
  like `/home/user/dir` it is possible to create a file with a name thats begins with
  the destination directory, i.e. `/home/user/dir.sh`. Because of the file name and
  destination directory constraints, the arbitrary file creation impact is limited
  and depends on the use case. contains a patch for this vulnerability."
