package_slug: "nuget/SharpZipLib"
title: "Path traversal in SharpZipLib"
description: "SharpZipLib (or #ziplib) is a Zip, GZip, Tar and BZip2 library. A check
  was added if the destination file is under destination directory. However, it is not 
  enforced that `destDir` ends with slash. If the `destDir` is not slash terminated 
  like `/home/user/dir` it is possible to create a file with a name thats
  begins with the destination directory, i.e. `/home/user/dir.sh`. Because of the
  file name and destination directory constraints, the arbitrary file creation impact
  is limited and depends on the use case. contains a patch for this vulnerability."
