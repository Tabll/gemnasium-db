package_slug: "nuget/SharpZipLib"
title: "Path traversal in SharpZipLib"
description: "SharpZipLib (or #ziplib) is a Zip, GZip, Tar and BZip2 library. A check
  was added if the destination file is under a destination directory. However, it
  is not enforced that `_baseDirectory` ends with slash. If the `_baseDirectory` is
  not slash terminated like `/home/user/dir` it is possible to create a file with
  a name thats begins as the destination directory one level up from the directory,
  i.e. `/home/user/dir.sh`. Because of the file name and destination directory constraints,
  the arbitrary file creation impact is limited and depends on the use case. fixed
  this vulnerability."
