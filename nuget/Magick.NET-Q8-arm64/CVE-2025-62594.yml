title: "ImageMagick CLAHE : Unsigned underflow and division-by-zero lead to OOB pointer
  arithmetic and process crash (DoS)"
description: "A single root cause in the CLAHE implementation — tile width/height
  becoming zero — produces two distinct but related unsafe behaviors.\nVulnerabilities
  exists in the `CLAHEImage()` function of ImageMagick’s `MagickCore/enhance.c`.\n\n1.
  Unsigned integer underflow → out-of-bounds pointer arithmetic (OOB): when `tile_info.height
  == 0`, the expression `tile_info.height - 1` (unsigned) wraps to a very large value;
  using that value in pointer arithmetic yields a huge offset and OOB memory access
  (leading to memory corruption, SIGSEGV, or resource exhaustion).\n2. **Division/modulus
  by zero**: where code performs `... / tile_info.width` or `... % tile_info.height`
  without re-checking for zero, causing immediate division-by-zero crashes under sanitizers
  or `abort` at runtime.\n\nBoth behaviors are triggered by the same invalid tile
  condition (e.g., CLI exact `-clahe 0x0!` or automatic tile derivation `dim >> 3
  == 0` for very small images).\n\n---"
