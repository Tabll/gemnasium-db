title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "A denial of service vulnerability exists when the ASP.NET Core fails
  to properly validate web requests. NOTE: Microsoft has not commented on third-party
  claims that the issue is that the TextEncoder.EncodeCore function in the System.Text.Encodings.Web
  package in ASP.NET Core Mvc before 1.0.4 and 1.1.x before 1.1.3 allows remote attackers
  to cause a denial of service by leveraging failure to properly calculate the length
  of 4-byte characters in the Unicode Non-Character range."
