title: "LiteDB may deserialize bad JSON on object type using _type"
description: "LiteDB is a small, fast and lightweight .NET NoSQL embedded database.
  Versions prior to 5.0.13 are subject to Deserialization of Untrusted Data. LiteDB
  uses a special field in JSON documents to cast different types from `BsonDocument`
  to POCO classes. When instances of an object are not the same of class, `BsonMapper`
  use a special field `_type` string info with full class name with assembly to be
  loaded and fit into your model. If your end-user can send to your app a plain JSON
  string, deserialization can load an unsafe object to fit into your model. This issue
  is patched in version 5.0.13 with some basic fixes to avoid this, but is not 100%
  guaranteed when using `Object` type. The next major version will contain an allow-list
  to select what kind of Assembly can be loaded. Workarounds are detailed in the vendor
  advisory."
