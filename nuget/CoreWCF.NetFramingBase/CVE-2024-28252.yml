title: "CoreWCF NetFraming based services can leave connections open when they should
  be closed"
description: "### Impact\nIf you have a NetFraming based CoreWCF service, extra system
  resources could be consumed by connections being left established instead of closing
  or aborting them. There are two scenarios when this can happen. When a client established
  a connection to the service and sends no data, the service will wait indefinitely
  for the client to initiate the NetFraming session handshake. Additionally, once
  a client has established a session, if the client doesn't send any requests for
  the period of time configured in the binding ReceiveTimeout, the connection is not
  properly closed as part of the session being aborted.  \nThe bindings affected by
  this behavior are NetTcpBinding, NetNamedPipeBinding, and UnixDomainSocketBinding.
  Only NetTcpBinding has the ability to accept non local connections.\n\n### Patches\nThe
  currently supported versions of CoreWCF are v1.4.x and v1.5.x. The fix can be found
  in v1.4.2 and v1.5.2 of the CoreWCF packages.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere are no workarounds.\n\n###
