- "GHSA-vh2m-22xx-q94f"
package_slug: "nuget/OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore"
title: "Sensitive query parameters logged by default in OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation
  http and AspNetCore"
description: "`OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http` writes the `url.full` attribute/tag
  on spans (`Activity`) when tracing is enabled for outgoing http requests and `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore`
  writes the `url.query` attribute/tag on spans (`Activity`) when tracing is enabled
  for incoming http requests.\n\nThese attributes are defined by the [Semantic Conventions
  for HTTP Spans](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/http/http-spans.md).\n\nUp
  until the `1.8.1` the values written by `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http` & `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore`
  will pass-through the raw query string as was sent or received (respectively). This
  may lead to sensitive information (e.g. EUII - End User Identifiable Information,
  credentials, etc.) being leaked into telemetry backends (depending on the application(s)
  being instrumented) which could cause privacy and/or security incidents.\n\nNote:
  Older versions of `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http` & `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore`
  may use different tag names but have the same vulnerability."
