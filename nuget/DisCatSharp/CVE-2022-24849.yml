package_slug: "nuget/DisCatSharp"
title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "DisCatSharp is a Discord API wrapper for .NET. Users of versions 9.8.5,
  9.8.6, 9.9.0 and previously published prereleases of 10.0.0 who have used either
  one of the two `RequireDisCatSharpDeveloperAttribute`s or the `BaseDiscordClient.LibraryDeveloperTeam`
  have potentially had their bot token sent to a web server not affiliated with Discord.
  This server is owned and operated by DisCatSharp's development team. The tokens
  were not logged, yet it is still advisable to reset the tokens of potentially affected
  bots. 9.9.1 has been released to patch the issue for the current stable release
  and the current 10.0.0 prereleases are also no longer affected. Users unable to
  upgrade should remove all uses of the two `RequireDisCatSharpDeveloperAttribute`s
  and all direct calls to `BaseDiscordClient.LibraryDeveloperTeam`."
