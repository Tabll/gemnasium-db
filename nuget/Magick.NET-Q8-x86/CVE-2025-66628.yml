title: "ImageMagick is vulnerable to an integer Overflow in TIM decoder leading to
  out of bounds read (32-bit only)"
description: "The TIM (PSX TIM) image parser in ImageMagick contains a critical integer
  overflow vulnerability in the `ReadTIMImage` function (`coders/tim.c`). The code
  reads `width` and `height` (16-bit values) from the file header and calculates `image_size
  = 2 * width * height` without checking for overflow.\nOn 32-bit systems (or where
  `size_t` is 32-bit), this calculation can overflow if `width` and `height` are large
  (e.g., 65535), wrapping around to a small value. This results in a small heap allocation
  via `AcquireQuantumMemory` and later operations relying on the dimensions can trigger
  an out of bounds read."
