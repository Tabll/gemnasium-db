title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "A denial of service vulnerability exists when the ASP.NET Core fails
  to properly validate web requests. NOTE: Microsoft has not commented on third-party
  claims that the issue is that the TextEncoder.EncodeCore function in the System.Text.Encodings.Web
  package in ASP.NET Core Mvc allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
  by leveraging failure to properly calculate the length of 4-byte characters in the
  Unicode Non-Character range."
