title: "Signature verification vulnerability in Stark Bank ecdsa libraries"
description: "An attacker can forge signatures on arbitrary messages that will verify
  for any public key. This may allow attackers to authenticate as any user within
  the Stark Bank platform, and bypass signature verification needed to perform operations
  on the platform, such as send payments and transfer funds. Additionally, the ability
  for attackers to forge signatures may impact other users and projects using these
  libraries in different and unforeseen ways."
