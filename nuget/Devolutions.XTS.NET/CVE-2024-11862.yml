package_slug: "nuget/Devolutions.XTS.NET"
title: "Devolutions.XTS.NET Vulnerable to Timing Attack on GF Multiplications"
description: "Timing attacks on Galois Field multiplications in this package. Successful
  exploitation would effectively allow a downgrade of the security guarantees of the
  XTS mode to the security guarantees of ECB mode, allowing block swapping, enabling
  identification of identical blocks, and rendering half of the XTS key obsolete.
  Timing attacks require specific conditions to be exploitable."
