title: "Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)"
description: "SSH.NET is a Secure Shell (SSH) library for .NET. In versions 2020.0.0
  and 2020.0.1, during an `X25519` key exchange, the clientâ€™s private key is generated
  with `System.Random`. `System.Random` is not a cryptographically secure random number
  generator, it must therefore not be used for cryptographic purposes. When establishing
  an SSH connection to a remote host, during the X25519 key exchange, the private
  key is generated with a weak random number generator whose seed can be brute forced.
  This allows an attacker who is able to eavesdrop on the communications to decrypt
  them. Version 2020.0.2 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, one may
  disable support for `curve25519-sha256` and `curve25519-sha256@libssh.org` key exchange
  algorithms."
