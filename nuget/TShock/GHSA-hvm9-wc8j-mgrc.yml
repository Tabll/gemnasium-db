description: "An issue with the way OTAPI manages client connections results in stale
  UUIDs remaining on `RemoteClient` instances after a player disconnects.\n\nBecause
  of this, if the following conditions are met a player may assume the login state
  of a previously connected player:\n1. The server has UUID login enabled\n2. An authenticated
  player disconnects\n3. A subsequent player connects with a modified client that
  does not send the `ClientUUID#68` packet during connection\n4. The server assigns
  the same `RemoteClient` object that belonged to the originally authenticated player
  to the newly connected player"
