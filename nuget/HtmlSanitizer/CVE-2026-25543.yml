title: "HtmlSanitizer has a bypass via template tag"
description: "If the `template` tag is allowed, its contents are not sanitized. The
  `template` tag is a special tag that does not usually render its contents, unless
  the `shadowrootmode` attribute is set to `open` or `closed`.\n\nThe lack of sanitization
  of the template tag brings up two bypasses:\n\n1. it is still possible to forcibly
  render the contents of a `<template>` tag through mutation XSS. The DOM parsers
  in browsers such as Chromium have a node depth limit of 512 and tags which are beyond
  that depth are flattened. This in turn allows elements within `<template>` (which
  are not sanitized) to be effectively 'popped out'. An example would look like this:
  `<div>[...]<template><script>alert('xss')</script>` where `[...]` denotes at least
  another 509 opening `<div>` tags.\n2. If in addition to the template tag, the `shadowrootmode`
  attribute is allowed through `sanitizer.AllowedAttributes.Add(\"shadowrootmode\");`,
  the simple payload of `<div><template shadowrootmode=\"open\"><script>alert('xss')</script>`
  would bypass the sanitizer. This is because such usage of `<template>` attaches
  a shadow root to its parent: `<div>`, and its contents will be rendered.\n\nNote
  that the default configuration is not affected because the `template` tag is disallowed
  by default."
