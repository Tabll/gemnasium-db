identifier: "CVE-2020-26293"
package_slug: "nuget/HtmlSanitizer"
title: "Cross-site Scripting"
description: "HtmlSanitizer is a .NET library for cleaning HTML fragments and documents
  from constructs that can lead to XSS attacks. In HtmlSanitizer, there is a possible
  XSS bypass if style tag is allowed. If you have explicitly allowed the `<style>`
  tag, an attacker could craft HTML that includes script after passing through the
  sanitizer. The default settings disallow the `<style>` tag so there is no risk if
  you have not explicitly allowed the `<style>` tag."
