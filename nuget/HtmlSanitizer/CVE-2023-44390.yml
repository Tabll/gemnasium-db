title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "HtmlSanitizer is a .NET library for cleaning HTML fragments and documents
  from constructs that can lead to XSS attacks. The vulnerability occurs in configurations
  where foreign content is allowed, i.e. either `svg` or `math` are in the list of
  allowed elements. In the case an application sanitizes user input with a vulnerable
  configuration, an attacker could bypass the sanitization and inject arbitrary HTML,
  including JavaScript code. Note that in the default configuration the vulnerability
  is not present. The vulnerability has been fixed in versions 8.0.723 and 8.1.722-beta
  (preview version)."
