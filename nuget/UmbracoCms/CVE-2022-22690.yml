package_slug: "nuget/UmbracoCms"
title: "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request Smuggling')"
description: "Within the Umbraco CMS, a configuration element named \"UmbracoApplicationUrl\"
  (or just \"ApplicationUrl\") is used whenever application code needs to build a
  URL pointing back to the site. For example, when a user resets their password and
  the application builds a password reset URL or when the administrator invites users
  to the site. For Umbraco versions less than, if the Application URL is not specifically
  configured, the attacker can manipulate this value and store it persistently affecting
  all users for components where the \"UmbracoApplicationUrl\" is used. For example,
  the attacker is able to change the URL users receive when resetting their password
  so that it points to the attackers server, when the user follows this link the reset
  token can be intercepted by the attacker resulting in account takeover."
