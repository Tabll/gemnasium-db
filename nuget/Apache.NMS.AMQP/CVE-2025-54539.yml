title: "Apache ActiveMQ NMS AMQP Client has a Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability"
description: "A Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability exists in the Apache
  ActiveMQ NMS AMQP Client.\n\nThis issue affects all versions of Apache ActiveMQ
  NMS AMQP up to and including 2.3.0, when establishing connections to untrusted AMQP
  servers. Malicious servers could exploit unbounded deserialization logic present
  in the client to craft responses that may lead to arbitrary code execution on the
  client side.\n\nAlthough version 2.1.0 introduced a mechanism to restrict deserialization
  via allow/deny lists, the protection was found to be bypassable under certain conditions.\n\nIn
  line with Microsoftâ€™s deprecation of binary serialization in .NET 9, the project
  is evaluating the removal of .NET binary serialization support from the NMS API
  entirely in future releases.\n\nMitigation and Recommendations:\nUsers are strongly
  encouraged to upgrade to version 2.4.0 or later, which resolves the issue. Additionally,
  projects depending on NMS-AMQP should migrate away from .NET binary serialization
  as part of a long-term hardening strategy."
