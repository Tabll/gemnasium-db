title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "Ajax.NET Professional (AjaxPro) is an AJAX framework available for Microsoft
  ASP.NET. Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to JavaScript object injection
  which may result in cross site scripting when leveraged by a malicious user. The
  affected core relates to JavaScript object creation when parsing json input. Releases
  before version 21.12.22.1 are affected. A workaround exists that replaces one of
  the core JavaScript files embedded in the library. See the GHSA-5q7q-qqw2-hjq7 for
