title: "Remote Code Execution in AjaxNetProfessional"
description: "Serialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of
  bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams.
  The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization.
  Serialization is commonly used for communication (sharing objects between multiple
  hosts) and persistence (store the object state in a file or a database). It is an
  integral part of popular protocols like Remote Method Invocation (RMI), Java Management
  Extension (JMX), Java Messaging System (JMS), Action Message Format (AMF), Java
  Server Faces (JSF) ViewState, etc.\n\nDeserialization of untrusted data (CWE-502),
  is when the application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying
  that the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control the state
  or the flow of the execution.\n\nJava deserialization issues have been known for
  years. However, interest in the issue intensified greatly in 2015, when classes
  that could be abused to achieve remote code execution were found in a popular library
  (Apache Commons Collection). These classes were used in zero-days affecting IBM
  WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic and many other products.\n\nAn attacker just needs to
  identify a piece of software that has both a vulnerable class on its path, and performs
  deserialization on untrusted data. Then all they need to do is send the payload
  into the deserializer, getting the command executed.\n\nDevelopers put too much
  trust in Java Object Serialization. Some even de-serialize objects pre-authentication.
  When deserializing an Object in Java you typically cast it to an expected type,
  and therefore Java's strict type system will ensure you only get valid object trees.
  Unfortunately, by the time the type checking happens, platform code has already
  created and executed significant logic. So, before the final type is checked a lot
  of code is executed from the readObject() methods of various objects, all of which
  is out of the developer's control. By combining the readObject() methods of various
  classes which are available on the classpath of the vulnerable application an attacker
  can execute functions (including calling Runtime.exec() to execute local OS commands)."
