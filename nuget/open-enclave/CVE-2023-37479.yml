package_slug: "nuget/open-enclave"
title: "Improper Initialization"
description: "Open Enclave is a hardware-agnostic open source library for developing
  applications that utilize Hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments, also known
  as Enclaves. There are two issues that are mitigated in version 0.19.3. First, Open
  Enclave SDK does not properly sanitize the `MXCSR` register on enclave entry. This
  makes applications vulnerable to MXCSR Configuration Dependent Timing (MCDT) attacks,
  where incorrect `MXCSR` values can impact instruction retirement by at most one
  cycle, depending on the (secret) data operand value. Please find more details in
  the guidance from Intel in the references. Second, Open Enclave SDK does not sanitize
  x86's alignment check flag `RFLAGS.AC` on enclave entry. This opens up the possibility
  for a side-channel attacker to be notified for every unaligned memory access performed
  by the enclave. The issue has been addressed in version 0.19.3 and the current master
  branch. Users will need to recompile their applications against the patched libraries
  to be protected from this vulnerability. There are no known workarounds for this
  vulnerability."
