identifier: "CVE-2020-15107"
package_slug: "nuget/open-enclave"
title: "Covert Channel"
description: "In openenclave, enclaves that use x87 FPU operations are vulnerable
  to tampering by a malicious host application. By violating the Linux System V Application
  Binary Interface (ABI) for such operations, a host app can compromise the execution
  integrity of some x87 FPU operations in an enclave. Depending on the FPU control
  configuration of the enclave app and whether the operations are used in secret-dependent
  execution paths, this vulnerability may also be used to mount a side-channel attack
  on the enclave."
