title: "Untrusted data can lead to DoS attack due to hash collisions and stack overflow
  in MessagePack"
description: "When this library is used to deserialize messagepack data from an untrusted
  source, there is a risk of a denial of service attack by either of two vectors:\n\n1.
  hash collisions - leading to large CPU consumption disproportionate to the size
  of the data being deserialized.\n1. stack overflow - leading to the deserializing
  process crashing."
