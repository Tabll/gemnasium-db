title: "Imageflow affected by libwebp zero-day and should not be used with malicious
  source images."
description: "### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability affects deployments of Imageflow that
  involve decoding or processing malicious source .webp files. If you only process
  your own trusted files, this should not affect you (but you should update anyway).
  \n\nImageflow relies on Google's [libwebp] library to decode .webp images, and is
  affected by the recent zero-day out-of-bounds write vulnerability [CVE-2023-4863](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-4863)
  and https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j7hp-h8jx-5ppr. The libwebp vulnerability
  also affects Chrome, Android, macOS, and other consumers of the library).\n\nlibwebp
  patched [the vulnerability](https://github.com/webmproject/libwebp/commit/2af26267cdfcb63a88e5c74a85927a12d6ca1d76
  ) and released [1.3.2](https://github.com/webmproject/libwebp/releases/tag/v1.3.2)
  \n\nThis was patched in [libwebp-sys in 0.9.3 and 0.9.4](https://github.com/NoXF/libwebp-sys/commits/master)\n\n**[Imageflow
  v2.0.0-preview8](https://github.com/imazen/imageflow/releases/tag/v2.0.0-preview8)
  uses the patched version of libwebp as well as updated versions of all dependencies.**\n\nNote:
  preview 8 requires libc 2.31 or higher on linux and macOS 11 or higher. These restrictions
  are due to the oldest supported versions of those platforms (which is reflected
  on Github Actions).\n\n### Patches\n\n**Imageflow v2.0.0-preview8 use the patched
  version (v1.3.2) of libwebp and libwebp-sys 0.9.4.**\n**Imageflow.AllPlatforms 0.10.2
  is patched**\n**Imageflow.Server v0.8.2 is patched**\n**ImageResizer.Plugins.Imageflow
  5.0.12 is patched**\n\n### Workarounds\n\nDisable webp decoding using `EnabledCodecs::disable_decoder(NamedDecoders::WebPDecoder)`
  if using the Rust API. \n\nOnly files that meet the following criteria will be passed
  to libwebp: \n\n```rust\nbytes.starts_with(b\"RIFF\") && bytes[8..12].starts_with(b\"WEBP\")\n```\n\nYou
  can utilize matching logic to block webp inputs in your language of choice.\n\n###
