title: "Apache ActiveMQ NMS OpenWire Client Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability"
description: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability in Apache ActiveMQ NMS
  OpenWire Client.\n\nThis issue affects Apache ActiveMQ NMS OpenWire Client before
  2.1.1 when performing connections to untrusted servers. Such servers could abuse
  the unbounded deserialization in the client to provide malicious responses that
  may eventually cause arbitrary code execution on the client. Version 2.1.0 introduced
  a allow/denylist feature to restrict deserialization, but this feature could be
  bypassed.\n\nThe .NET team has deprecated the built-in .NET binary serialization
  feature starting with .NET 9 and suggests migrating away from binary serialization.
  The project is considering to follow suit and drop this part of the NMS API altogether.\n\nUsers
  are recommended to upgrade to version 2.1.1, which fixes the issue. We also recommend
  to migrate away from relying on .NET binary serialization as a hardening method
  for the future."
