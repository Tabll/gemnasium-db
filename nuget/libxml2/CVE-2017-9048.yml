identifiers:
- "CVE-2017-9048"
package_slug: "nuget/libxml2"
title: "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer"
description: "libxml2 is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow. The function
  xmlSnprintfElementContent in valid.c is supposed to recursively dump the element
  content definition into a char buffer 'buf' of size 'size'. At the end of the routine,
  the function may strcat two more characters without checking whether the current
  strlen(buf) + 2 < size. This vulnerability causes programs that use libxml2, such
  as PHP, to crash."
