package_slug: "nuget/Umbraco.CMS"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "Umbraco is an ASP.NET content management system (CMS). Starting in version
  7.0.0 and prior to versions 7.15.11, 8.18.9, 10.7.0, 11.5.0, and 12.2.0, a user
  with access to the backoffice can upload SVG files that include scripts. If the
  user can trick another user to load the media directly in a browser, the scripts
  can be executed. Versions 7.15.11, 8.18.9, 10.7.0, 11.5.0, and 12.2.0 contain a
  patch for this issue. Some workarounds are available. Implement the server side
  file validation or serve all media from an different host (e.g cdn) than where Umbraco
  is hosted."
