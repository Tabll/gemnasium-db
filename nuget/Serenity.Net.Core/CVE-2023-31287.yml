package_slug: "nuget/Serenity.Net.Core"
title: "Insufficient token expiration in Serenity"
description: "An issue was discovered in Serenity Serene (and StartSharp) before 6.7.0.
  Password reset links are sent by email. A link contains a token that is used to
  reset the password. This token remains valid even after the password reset and can
  be used a second time to change the password of the corresponding user. The token
  expires only 3 hours after issuance and is sent as a query parameter when resetting.
  An attacker with access to the browser history can thus use the token again to change
  the password in order to take over the account."
