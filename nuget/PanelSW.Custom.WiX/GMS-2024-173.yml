title: "Panel::Software Customized WiX .be TEMP folder is vulnerable to DLL redirection
  attacks that allow the attacker to escalate privileges"
description: "# Summary\n\n.be TEMP folder is vulnerable to DLL redirection attacks
  that allow the attacker to escalate privileges.\n\n# Details\n\nIf the bundle is
  not run as admin, the user's TEMP folder is used and not the system TEMP folder.
  A utility is able to monitor the user's TEMP folder for changes and drop its own
  DLL into the .be/.Local folder immediately when the .be folder is created. When
  the burn engine elevates, the malicious DLL receives elevated privileges.\n\n# PoC\n\nAs
  a standard, non-admin user:\n\n1. Monitor the user's TEMP folder for changes using
  ReadDirectoryChangesW\n1. On FILE_ACTION_ADDED, check if the folder name is .be\n1.
  Create a folder in .be named after the bundle + .Local (e.g. MyInstaller.exe.Local)\n1.
  Put the malicious COMCTL32.DLL in the .Local folder following the naming used for
  the real DLL (e.g. MyInstaller.exe.Local/x86_microsoft.windows.common-controls_.../COMCTL32.dll)\n1.
  Do hacker things when the engine escalates and the malicious DLL is loaded\n\nProper
  naming for the path can be obtained by using GetModuleHandle(\"comctl32.dll\") and
  GetModuleFileName.\n\n# Impact\n\nDLL redirection utilizing .exe.Local Windows capability.
  This impacts any installer built with the WiX installer framework.\n"
