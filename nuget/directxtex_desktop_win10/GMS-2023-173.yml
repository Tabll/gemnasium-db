title: "Security bug in ConvertToSinglePlane when used with untrusted content from
  the DDS loader"
description: "### Impact\nA memory overwrite bug was reported by a security researcher
  in the **ConvertToSinglePlane** method via the *texconv* command-line tool when
  given an invalid height for planar video textures such as NV12. This can be a potential
  security bug for any clients of the library who follow the same pattern.\n\nThis
  issue *does not* impact use of the DDS texture loader itself, only when combined
  with `ConvertToSinglePlane` for converting multi-planar video formats. All other
  functions in the library fail immediately if given images in planar formats.\n\n###
  Patches\nThe fix to the specific area as well as general hardening can be found
  in [this PR](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXTex/pull/307) and will be included
  in the January 2023 or later release of DirectXTex.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf your
  code makes use of **ConvertToSinglePlane**, you can validate that the width & height
  alignment requirements are met for the input image before calling the function.\n"
