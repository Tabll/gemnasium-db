description: "A vulnerability exists in the `DSInternals.Common.Data.RoamedCredential.Save()` method, 
  which incorrectly parses the `msPKIAccountCredentials` LDAP attribute values. As a consequence, 
   malicious actor would be able to modify the file system of the computer where an application 
   using this function is executed with administrative privileges. A similar security issue used 
   to be present in the Windows operating system, as DSInternals re-implements the Credential 
   Roaming feature of Windows."
