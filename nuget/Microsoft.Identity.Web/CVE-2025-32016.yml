description: "_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\n**Description:**
  This vulnerability affects confidential client applications, including daemons,
  web apps, and web APIs. Under specific circumstances, sensitive information such
  as client secrets or certificate details may be exposed in the service logs of these
  applications. Service logs are intended to be handled securely.\n\n**Impact:** The
  vulnerability impacts service logs that meet the following criteria:\n\n- **Logging
  Level:** Logs are generated at the information level.\n- **Credential Descriptions:**
  containing:\n- Local file paths with passwords.\n- Base64 encoded values.\n- Client
  secret.\n\nAdditionally, logs of services using Base64 encoded certificates or certificate
  paths with password credential descriptions are also affected if the certificates
  are invalid or expired, regardless of the log level. Note that these credentials
  are not usable due to their invalid or expired status.\n\nIf your service logs are
  handled securely, you are not impacted.\n\nOtherwise, the following table shows
  when you can be impacted\n| Log Level Information for Microsoft.Identity.Web | Invalid
  Certificate\n-- | -- | --\nOne of the ClientCredentials credential description has
  a CredentialSource = Base64Encoded or (CredentialSource = Path) | Impacted | Impacted\nOne
  of the ClientCredentials credential description is a Client secret (CredentialSource
