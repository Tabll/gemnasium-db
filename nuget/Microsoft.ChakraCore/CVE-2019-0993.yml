- "GHSA-2rfj-2mwp-787v"
package_slug: "nuget/Microsoft.ChakraCore"
title: "Chakra Scripting Engine Out-of-bounds write"
description: "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the Chakra
  scripting engine handles objects in memory in Microsoft Edge (HTML-based). The vulnerability
  could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code
  in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability
  could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged
  on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability
  could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs;
  view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. In a
  web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that
  is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Microsoft Edge (HTML-based) and
  then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage
  of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or
  advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could
  exploit the vulnerability. The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying
  how the Chakra scripting engine handles objects in memory."
