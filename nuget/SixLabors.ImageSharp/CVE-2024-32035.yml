title: "SixLabors.ImageSharp vulnerable to Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value"
description: "A vulnerability discovered in the ImageSharp library, where the processing
  of specially crafted files can lead to excessive memory usage in image decoders.
  The vulnerability is triggered when ImageSharp attempts to process image files that
  are designed to exploit this flaw.\n\nThis flaw can be exploited to cause a denial
  of service (DoS) by depleting process memory, thereby affecting applications and
  services that rely on ImageSharp for image processing tasks. Users and administrators
  are advised to update to the latest version of ImageSharp that addresses this vulnerability
  to mitigate the risk of exploitation."
