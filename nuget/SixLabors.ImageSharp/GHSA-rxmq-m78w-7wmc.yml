title: "SixLabors ImageSharp Has Infinite Loop in GIF Decoder When Skipping Malformed
  Comment Extension Blocks"
description: "A specially crafted GIF file containing a malformed comment extension
  block (with a missing block terminator) can cause the ImageSharp GIF decoder to
  enter an infinite loop while attempting to skip the block. This leads to a denial
  of service. Applications processing untrusted GIF input should upgrade to a patched
  version."
