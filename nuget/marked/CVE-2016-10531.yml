package_slug: "nuget/marked"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "marked is an application that is meant to parse and compile markdown.
  Due to the way that marked parses input, specifically HTML entities, it's possible
  to bypass marked's content injection protection (`sanitize: true`) to inject a `javascript:`
  URL. This flaw exists because `&#xNNanything;` gets parsed to what it could and
  leaves the rest behind, resulting in just `anything;` being left."
