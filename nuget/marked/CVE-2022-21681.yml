title: "Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity"
description: "The regular expression `inline.reflinkSearch`
  may cause catastrophic backtracking against some strings and lead to a denial of
  service (DoS). Anyone who runs untrusted markdown through a vulnerable version of
  marked and does not use a worker with a time limit may be affected. This issue is
  patched As a workaround, avoid running untrusted markdown through marked or run
  marked on a worker thread and set a reasonable time limit to prevent draining resources."
