title: "Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity"
description: "The regular expression `inline.reflinkSearch` may cause catastrophic
  backtracking against some strings and lead to a denial of service (DoS). Anyone
  who runs untrusted markdown through a vulnerable version of marked and does not
  use a worker with a time limit may be affected. This issue is patched As a workaround,
  avoid running untrusted markdown through marked or run marked on a worker thread
  and set a reasonable time limit to prevent draining resources."
