title: "Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity"
description: "The regular expression `block.def` may cause catastrophic backtracking
  against some strings and lead to a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS).
  Anyone who runs untrusted markdown through a vulnerable version of marked and does
  not use a worker with a time limit may be affected. This issue is patched As a workaround,
  avoid running untrusted markdown through marked or run marked on a worker thread
  and set a reasonable time limit to prevent draining resources."
