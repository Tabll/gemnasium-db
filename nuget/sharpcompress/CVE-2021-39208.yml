identifier: "CVE-2021-39208"
package_slug: "nuget/sharpcompress"
title: "Path Traversal"
description: "SharpCompress is a fully managed C# library to deal with many compression
  types and formats. SharpCompress has been found to be vulnerable to partial path
  traversal. SharpCompress recreates a hierarchy of directories under destinationDirectory
  if `ExtractFullPath` is set to true in options. In order to prevent extraction outside
  the destination directory the `destinationFileName` path is verified to begin with
  `fullDestinationDirectoryPath`. However, it is not enforced that `fullDestinationDirectoryPath`
  ends with slash. If the `destinationDirectory` is not slash terminated like `/home/user/dir`
  it is possible to create a file with a name thats begins as the destination directory
  one level up from the directory, i.e. `/home/user/dir.sh`. Because of the file name
  and destination directory constraints the arbitrary file creation impact is limited
  and depends on the use case. This issue is fixed in SharpCompress "
