package_slug: "nuget/Duende.IdentityServer"
title: "IdentityServer Open Redirect vulnerability"
description: "It is possible for an attacker to craft malicious Urls that certain
  functions in IdentityServer will incorrectly treat as local and trusted. If such
  a Url is returned as a redirect, some browsers will follow it to a third-party,
  untrusted site.\n\n_Note: by itself, this vulnerability does **not** allow an attacker
  to obtain user credentials, authorization codes, access tokens, refresh tokens,
  or identity tokens. An attacker could however exploit this vulnerability as part
  of a phishing attack designed to steal user credentials._"
