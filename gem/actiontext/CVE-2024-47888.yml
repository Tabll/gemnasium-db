title: "Possible ReDoS vulnerability in plain_text_for_blockquote_node in Action Text"
description: "There is a possible ReDoS vulnerability in the plain_text_for_blockquote_node
  helper in Action Text. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2024-47888.\n\nImpact\n------\n\nCarefully
  crafted text can cause the plain_text_for_blockquote_node helper to take an unexpected
  amount of time, possibly resulting in a DoS vulnerability. All users running an
  affected release should either upgrade or apply the relevant patch immediately.\n\nRuby
  3.2 has mitigations for this problem, so Rails applications using Ruby 3.2 or newer
  are unaffected. Rails 8.0.0.beta1 depends on Ruby 3.2 or greater so is unaffected.\n\n\nReleases\n--------\nThe
  fixed releases are available at the normal locations.\n\nWorkarounds\n-----------\nUsers
  can avoid calling `plain_text_for_blockquote_node` or upgrade to Ruby 3.2\n\nCredits\n-------\n\nThanks
  to [ooooooo_q](https://hackerone.com/ooooooo_q) for the report!"
