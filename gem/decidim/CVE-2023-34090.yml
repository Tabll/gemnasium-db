package_slug: "gem/decidim"
title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "Decidim is a participatory democracy framework, written in Ruby on Rails,
  originally developed for the Barcelona City government online and offline participation
  website. Decidim uses a third-party library named Ransack for filtering certain
  database collections (e.g., public meetings). By default, this library allows filtering
  on all data attributes and associations. This allows an unauthenticated remote attacker
  to exfiltrate non-public data from the underlying database of a Decidim instance
  (e.g., exfiltrating data from the user table). This issue may lead to Sensitive
  Data Disclosure. The problem was patched in version 0.27.3. "
