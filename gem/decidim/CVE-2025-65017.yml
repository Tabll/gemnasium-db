title: "Decidim's private data exports can lead to data leaks"
description: "Private data exports can lead to data leaks in cases where the UUID
  generation causes collisions for the generated UUIDs.\n\nThe bug was introduced
  by #13571 and affects Decidim versions 0.30.0 or newer (currently 2025-09-23).\n\nThis
  issue  was discovered by running the following spec several times in a row, as it
  can randomly fail due to this bug:\n\n```bash\n$ cd decidim-core\n$ for i in {1..10};
  do bundle exec rspec spec/jobs/decidim/download_your_data_export_job_spec.rb -e
  \"deletes the\" || break ; done\n```\n\nRun the spec as many times as needed to
  hit a UUID that converts to `0` through `.to_i`.\n\nThe UUID to zero conversion
  does not cause a security issue but the security issue is demonstrated with the
  following example.\n\nThe following code regenerates the issue by assigning a predefined
  UUID that will generate a collision (example assumes there are already two existing
  users in the system):\n\n```ruby"
