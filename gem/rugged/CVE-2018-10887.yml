title: "Out-of-bounds Read"
description: "A flaw was found in libgit2 which is wrapped by the rugged gem. It has

  in `delta.c` file may lead to an integer overflow which in turn leads to an out
  of bound read, which allows reading before the base object. An attacker may use
  this flaw to leak memory addresses or cause a Denial of Service."
