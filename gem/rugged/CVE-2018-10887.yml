package_slug: "gem/rugged"
title: "Out-of-bounds Read"
description: "A flaw was found in libgit2 which is wrapped by the rugged gem. It has
  been discovered that an unexpected sign extension in `git_delta_apply` function
  in `delta.c` file may lead to an integer overflow which in turn leads to an out-of-bound
  read, which allows reading before the base object. An attacker may use this flaw
  to leak memory addresses or cause a Denial of Service."
