identifier: "CVE-2020-15133"
package_slug: "gem/faye-websocket"
title: "Improper Certificate Validation"
description: "In faye-websocket, there is a lack of certification validation in TLS
  handshakes. The `Faye::WebSocket::Client` class uses the `EM::Connection#start_tls`
  method in EventMachine to implement the TLS handshake whenever a `wss:` URL is used
  for the connection. This method does not implement certificate verification by default,
  meaning that it does not check that the server presents a valid and trusted TLS
  certificate for the expected hostname. That means that any `wss:` connection made
  using this library is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack, since it does not
  confirm the identity of the server it is connected to."
