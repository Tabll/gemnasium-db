package_slug: "gem/request_store"
title: "request_store has Incorrect Default Permissions"
description: "The files published as part of request_store 1.3.2 have 0666 permissions,
  meaning that they are world-writable, which allows local users to execute arbitrary
  code.\n\nThis version was published in 2017, and most production environments do
  not allow access for local users, so the chances of this being exploited are very
  low, given that the vast majority of users will have upgraded, and those that have
  not, if any, are not likely to be exposed."
