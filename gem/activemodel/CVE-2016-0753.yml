identifier: "CVE-2016-0753"
package_slug: "gem/activemodel"
title: "Possible Input Validation Circumvention"
description: "Code that uses Active Model based models (including Active Record models)
  and does not validate user input before passing it to the model can be subject to
  an attack where specially crafted input will cause the model to skip validations.
  Rails users using Strong Parameters are generally not impacted by this issue as
  they are encouraged to allow parameters and must specifically opt-out of input verification
  using the `permit!` method to allow mass assignment. "
