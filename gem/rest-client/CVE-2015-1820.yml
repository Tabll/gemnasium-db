identifier: "CVE-2015-1820"
package_slug: "gem/rest-client"
title: "Session fixation vulnerability via Set-Cookie headers"
description: "The package rest-client in `abstract_response.rb` improperly handles
  `Set-Cookie` headers on HTTP redirection responses. Any cookies will be forwarded
  to the redirection target regardless of domain, path, or expiration. If you control
  a redirection source, you can cause rest-client to perform a request to any third-party
  domain with cookies of your choosing, which may be useful in performing a session
  fixation attack. If you control a redirection target, you can steal any cookies
  set by the third-party redirection request."
