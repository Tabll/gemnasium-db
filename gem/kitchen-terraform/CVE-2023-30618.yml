identifiers:

- "GHSA-65g2-x53q-cmf6"
package_slug: "gem/kitchen-terraform"
title: "Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File"
description: "Kitchen-Terraform provides a set of Test Kitchen plugins which enable
  the use of Test Kitchen to converge a Terraform configuration and verify the resulting
  infrastructure systems with InSpec controls. Kitchen-Terraform v7.0.0 introduced
  a regression which caused all Terraform output values, including sensitive values,
  to be printed at the `info` logging level during the `kitchen converge` action.
  Prior to v7.0.0, the output values were printed at the `debug` level to avoid writing
  sensitive values to the terminal by default. An attacker would need access to the
  local machine in order to gain access to these logs during an operation. Users are
  advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
