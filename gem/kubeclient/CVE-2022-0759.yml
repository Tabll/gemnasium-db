package_slug: "gem/kubeclient"
title: "Improper Certificate Validation"
description: "A flaw was found in all versions of kubeclient up to (but not including)
  v4.9.3, the Ruby client for Kubernetes REST API, in the way it parsed kubeconfig
  files. When the kubeconfig file does not configure custom CA to verify certs, kubeclient
  ends up accepting any certificate (it wrongly returns VERIFY_NONE). Ruby applications
  that leverage kubeclient to parse kubeconfig files are susceptible to Man-in-the-middle
  attacks (MITM)."
