title: "Ruby SAML allows a SAML authentication bypass due to DOCTYPE handling (parser
  differential)"
description: "An authentication bypass vulnerability was found in ruby-saml due to
  a parser differential.\nReXML and Nokogiri parse XML differently, the parsers can
  generate entirely different document structures from the same XML input. That allows
  an attacker to be able to execute a Signature Wrapping attack."
