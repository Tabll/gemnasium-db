title: "Ruby-saml has a SAML authentication bypass due to namespace handling (parser
  differential)"
description: "Ruby-saml up to and including 1.12.4, there is an authentication bypass
  vulnerability because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2025-25292. ReXML and Nokogiri
  parse XML differently, the parsers can generate entirely different document structures
  from the same XML input. That allows an attacker to be able to execute a Signature
  Wrapping attack. The vulnerability does not affect the version 1.18.0."
