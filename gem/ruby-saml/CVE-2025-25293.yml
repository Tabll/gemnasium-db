title: "Ruby SAML allows remote Denial of Service (DoS) with compressed SAML responses"
description: "ruby-saml is susceptible to remote Denial of Service (DoS) with compressed
  SAML responses.\n\nRuby-saml uses zlib to decompress SAML responses in case they're
  compressed. It is possible to bypass the message size check with a compressed assertion
  since the message size is checked before inflation and not after."
