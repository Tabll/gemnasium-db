identifier: "CVE-2017-11428"
package_slug: "gem/ruby-saml"
title: "Authentication bypass via incorrect DOM traversal and canonicalization"
description: "Some XML DOM traversal and canonicalization APIs may be inconsistent
  in handling of comments within XML nodes. Incorrect use of these APIs by some SAML
  libraries results in incorrect parsing of the inner text of XML nodes such that
  any inner text after the comment is lost prior to cryptographically signing the
  SAML message. Text after the comment therefore has no impact on the signature on
  the SAML message. A remote attacker can modify SAML content for a SAML service provider
  without invalidating the cryptographic signature, which may allow attackers to bypass
  primary authentication for the affected SAML service provider "
