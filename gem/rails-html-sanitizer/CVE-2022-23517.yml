title: "Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity"
description: "rails-html-sanitizer is responsible for sanitizing HTML fragments in
  Rails applications. Certain configurations of rails-html-sanitizer < 1.4.4 use an
  inefficient regular expression that is susceptible to excessive backtracking when
  attempting to sanitize certain SVG attributes. This may lead to a denial of service
  through CPU resource consumption. This issue has been patched in version 1.4.4."
