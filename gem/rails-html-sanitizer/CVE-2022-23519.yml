package_slug: "gem/rails-html-sanitizer"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "rails-html-sanitizer is responsible for sanitizing HTML fragments in
  Rails applications. Prior to version 1.4.4, a possible XSS vulnerability with certain
  configurations of Rails::Html::Sanitizer may allow an attacker to inject content
  if the application developer has overridden the sanitizer's allowed tags in either
  of the following ways: allow both \"math\" and \"style\" elements, or allow both
  \"svg\" and \"style\" elements. Code is only impacted if allowed tags are being
  overridden. . This issue is fixed in version 1.4.4. All users overriding the allowed
  tags to include \"math\" or \"svg\" and \"style\" should either upgrade or use the
  following workaround immediately: Remove \"style\" from the overridden allowed tags,
  or remove \"math\" and \"svg\" from the overridden allowed tags."
