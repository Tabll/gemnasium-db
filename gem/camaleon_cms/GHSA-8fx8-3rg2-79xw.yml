title: "Camaleon CMS vulnerable to stored XSS through user file upload (GHSL-2024-184)"
description: "A stored cross-site scripting has been found in the image upload functionality
  that can be used by normal registered users: It is possible to upload a SVG image
  containing JavaScript and it's also possible to upload a HTML document when the
  format parameter is manually changed to [documents][1] or a string of an [unsupported
  format][2]. If an authenticated user or administrator visits that uploaded image
  or document malicious JavaScript can be executed on their behalf\n(e.g. changing
  or deleting content inside of the CMS.)"
