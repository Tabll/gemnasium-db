description: "An arbitrary file write vulnerability accessible via the upload method
  of the MediaController allows authenticated users to write arbitrary files to any
  location on the web server Camaleon CMS is running on (depending on the permissions
  of the underlying filesystem). E.g. This can lead to a delayed remote code execution
  in case an attacker is able to write a Ruby file into the config/initializers/ subfolder
  of the Ruby on Rails application."
