title: "Camaleon CMS allows stored XSS through user file upload (GHSL-2024-184)"
description: "A stored cross-site scripting has been found in the image upload functionality
  that can be used by normal registered users: It is possible to upload a SVG image
  containing JavaScript and it's also possible to upload a HTML document when the
  format parameter is manually changed to documents or a string of an unsupported format.
  If an authenticated user or administrator visits that uploaded image or document
  malicious JavaScript can be executed on their behalf (e.g. changing or deleting
  content inside of the CMS)."
