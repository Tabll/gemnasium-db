identifier: "CVE-2020-15134"
package_slug: "gem/faye"
title: "Improper Certificate Validation"
description: "In faye-websocket, there is a lack of certification validation in TLS
  handshakes. The `Faye::WebSocket::Client` class uses the `EM::Connection#start_tls`
  method in `EventMachine` to implement the TLS handshake whenever a `wss:` URL is
  used for the connection. This method does not implement certificate verification
  by default, meaning that it does not check that the server presents a valid and
  trusted TLS certificate for the expected hostname. That means that any `wss:` connection
  made using this library is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack."
