identifier: "CVE-2013-0334"
package_slug: "gem/bundler"
title: "Remote code execution"
description: "Any Gemfile with multiple top-level `source` lines cannot reliably control
  the gem server that a particular gem is fetched from. As a result, Bundler might
  install the wrong gem if more than one source provides a gem with the same name.
  This is especially possible in the case of Github's legacy gem server, hosted at
  gems.github.com. An attacker might create a malicious gem on Rubygems.org with the
  same name as a commonly-used Github gem. From that point forward, running `bundle
  install` might result in the malicious gem being used instead of the expected gem. "
