title: "Duplicate of ./gem/activestorage/CVE-2022-21831.yml"
description: "The Active Storage module of Rails starting with version 5.2.0 are possibly
  vulnerable to code injection. This issue was patched in versions 5.2.6.2, 6.0.4.7,
  6.1.4.7, and 7.0.2.3. To work around this issue, applications should implement a
  strict allow-list on accepted transformation methods or arguments. Additionally,
  a strict ImageMagick security policy will help mitigate this issue."
