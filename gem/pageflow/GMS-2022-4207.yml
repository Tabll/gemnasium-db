title: "Pageflow vulnerable to insecure direct object reference in membership update
  endpoint"
description: "Pageflow has a membership edit feature which allows users to edit the 
  roles of user memberships associated with an account that they have the manager 
  role to (including their own). While the Entity dropdown select field is greyed 
  out in the UI, an attacker can use tools which allow sending arbitrary HTTP request 
  to craft a request to the /admin/users/{user_id}/memberships/{membership_id} 
  endpoint containing an additional membership[entity_id] parameter. This parameter 
  is honored when the membership is updated, allowing an attacker to update the 
  membership object associated with their own account (with manager role) to be 
  associated with a different attacker-chosen account instead. Since account_ids 
  are enumerable, an attacker can compromise all accounts present on the platform."
