package_slug: "gem/actionview"
title: "Possible Information Leak Vulnerability"
description: "Applications that pass unverified user input to the `render` method
  in a controller may be vulnerable to an information leak vulnerability. Impacted
  code will look something like this: ``` def index; render params[:id]; end ``` Carefully
  crafted requests can cause the above code to render files from unexpected places
  like outside the application's view directory, and can possibly escalate this to
  a remote code execution attack."
