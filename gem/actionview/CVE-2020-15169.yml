package_slug: "gem/actionview"
title: "Cross-site Scripting"
description: "In Action View there is a potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
  in Action View's translation helpers. Views that allow the user to control the default
  (not found) value of the `t` and `translate` helpers could be susceptible to XSS
  attacks. When an HTML-unsafe string is passed as the default for a missing translation
  key named html or ending in `_html`, the default string is incorrectly marked as
  HTML-safe and not escaped."
