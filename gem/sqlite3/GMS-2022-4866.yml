title: "SQLite3 addresses vulnerability in packaged version of libsqlite"
description: "Summary: The rubygem sqlite3 v1.5.1 upgrades the packaged version
  of libsqlite from v3.39.3 to v3.39.4. libsqlite v3.39.4 addresses a vulnerability
  described as follows in the release notification: Version 3.39.4 is a minimal 
  patch against the prior release that addresses issues found since the prior 
  release. In particular, a potential vulnerability in the FTS3 extension has 
  been fixed, so this should be considered a security update. In order to 
  exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must have full SQL access and must be 
  able to construct a corrupt database with over 2GB of FTS3 content. The problem 
  arises from a 32-bit signed integer overflow. This vulnerability has not been 
  assigned a CVE and does not have a severity declared. Please note that this 
  advisory only applies to the sqlite3 gem v1.5.0, and only if the packaged 
  libsqlite is being used. If you've overridden defaults at installation time 
  to use system libraries instead of packaged libraries, you should instead 
  pay attention to your distro's libsqlite release announcements.
  Mitigation: Upgrade to the rubygem sqlite3 v1.5.1 or later. Users who are 
  unable to upgrade the sqlite3 gem may also choose a more complicated 
  mitigation: compile and link sqlite3 against external libsqlite >= 3.39.4 
  which will also address these same issues.
