package_slug: "gem/sorcery"
title: "Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts"
description: "In Sorcery, there is a brute force vulnerability when using password
  authentication via Sorcery. The brute force protection submodule will prevent a
  brute force attack for the defined lockout period, but once expired, protection
  will not be re-enabled until a user or malicious actor logs in successfully. This
  does not affect users that do not use the built-in brute force protection submodule,
  nor users that use permanent account lockout."
