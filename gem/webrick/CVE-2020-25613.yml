title: "WEBRick vulnerable to HTTP Request/Response Smuggling"
description: "An issue was discovered in Ruby through 2.5.8, 2.6.x through 2.6.6,
  and 2.7.x through 2.7.1. WEBrick, a simple HTTP server bundled with Ruby, had not
  checked the transfer-encoding header value rigorously. An attacker may potentially
  exploit this issue to bypass a reverse proxy (which also has a poor header check),
  which may lead to an HTTP Request Smuggling attack."
