description: "There is an issue where if an HTML file is uploaded with a `.html` extension,
  but the content type is listed as being `image/jpeg`, this will bypass a validation
  checking for images. But it will also pass the spoof check, because a file named
  `.html` and containing actual HTML passes the spoof check."
