title: "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
description: "`solidus_frontend` is the cart and storefront for the Solidus e-commerce
  project. Versions of `solidus_frontend` contain a cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
  vulnerability that allows a malicious site to add an item to the user's cart without
  their knowledge. contain a patch for this issue. The patch adds CSRF token verification
  to the \"Add to cart\" action. Adding forgery protection to a form that missed it
  can have some side effects. Other CSRF protection strategies as well as a workaround
  involving modifcation to config/application.rb` are available. More details on these
  mitigations are available in the GitHub Security Advisory."
