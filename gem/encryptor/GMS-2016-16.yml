title: "AES-GCM nonce reuse vulnerability"
description: "The package encryptor encrypts all messages using the same key/nonce.
  This not only exposes the XOR of the plaintexts if you XOR together two ciphertexts,
  but it also leaks the AES-GCM authentication key, allowing an attacker to forge
  messages and potentially perform chosen ciphertext attacks, which could potentially
  enable full plaintext recovery."
