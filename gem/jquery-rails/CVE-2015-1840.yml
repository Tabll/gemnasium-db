title: "CSRF vulnerability"
description: "In the scenario where an attacker might be able to control the `href`
  attribute of an anchor tag or the action attribute of a form tag that will trigger
  a POST action, the attacker can set the `href` or `action` to ` https://attacker.com`
  (note the leading space) that will be passed to JQuery, who will see this as a same
  origin request, and send the user's CSRF token to the attacker domain."
