title: "encoded_id-rails potential DOS vulnerability due to URIs with extremely long
  encoded IDs"
description: "The length of URIs and the various parts (eg path segments, query parameters)
  is usually limited by the webserver processing the incoming request. In the case
  of Puma the defaults are :\n\n- path segment length: 8192\n- Max URI length: 1024
  * 12\n- Max query length: 1024 * 10\n\nSee https://github.com/puma/puma/blob/master/docs/compile_options.md\n\nIf
  too long Puma raises:\n> Puma caught this error: HTTP element REQUEST_PATH is longer
  than the (8192) allowed length (was 12503) (Puma::HttpParserError)\n\nHowever due
  to the performance of `hashids` extremely long encoded IDs will consume a large
  amount of CPU and allocate a huge number of intermediate objects.\n\nFor example:"
