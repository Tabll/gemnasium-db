title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "Decidim is a participatory democracy framework, written in Ruby on Rails,
  originally developed for the Barcelona City government online and offline participation
  website. The external link feature is susceptible to cross-site scripting. This
  allows a remote attacker to execute JavaScript code in the context of a currently
  logged-in user. An attacker could use this vulnerability to make other users endorse
  or support proposals they have no intention of supporting or endorsing. The problem
  was patched in versions 0.27.3 and 0.26.7."
