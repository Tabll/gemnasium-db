title: "Spree API has Authenticated Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) via Order
  Modification"
description: "An Authenticated Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability
  was identified that allows an authenticated user to retrieve other users’ address
  information by modifying an existing order.\nBy editing an order they legitimately
  own and manipulating address identifiers in the request, the backend server accepts
  and processes references to addresses belonging to other users, subsequently associating
  those addresses with the attacker’s order and returning them in the response."
