title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "Addressable is an alternative implementation to the URI implementation
  that is part of Ruby's standard library. An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability
  exists Within the URI template implementation in Addressable, a maliciously crafted
  template may result in uncontrolled resource consumption, leading to denial of service
  when matched against a URI. In typical usage, templates would not normally be read
  from untrusted user input, but nonetheless, no previous security advisory for Addressable
  has cautioned against doing this. Users of the parsing capabilities in Addressable
  but not the URI template capabilities are unaffected. The vulnerability is patched
  As a workaround, only create Template objects from trusted sources that have been
  validated not to produce catastrophic backtracking."
