title: "XSS via parse_inline()"
description: "There's a flaw that allows a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. This
  flaw exists because the `parse_inline()` function in markdown.c does not validate
  input before returning it to users. This may allow a remote attacker to create a
  specially crafted request that would execute arbitrary script code in a user's browser
  session within the trust relationship between their browser and the server."
