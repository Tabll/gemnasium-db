title: "Remote code execution and potential Denial of Service Vulnerability"
description: "Activeresource contains a format string flaw in the request function
  of `lib/active_resource/connection.rb`. The issue is triggered as format string
  specifiers (e.g. `%s` and `%x`) are not properly sanitized in user-supplied input
  when passed via the `result.code` and `result.message` variables. This may allow
  a remote attacker to cause a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary
  code."
