title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "OpenSearch is a community-driven, open source fork of Elasticsearch
  and Kibana. OpenSearch allows users to specify a local file when defining text analyzers
  to process data for text analysis. An issue in the implementation of this feature
  allows certain specially crafted queries to return a response containing the first
  line of text from arbitrary files. The list of potentially impacted files is limited
  to text files with read permissions allowed in the Java Security Manager policy
  configuration. OpenSearch version 1.3.7 and 2.4.0 contain a fix for this issue.
  Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue."
