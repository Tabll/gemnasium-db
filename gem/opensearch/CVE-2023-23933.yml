title: "Out-of-bounds Read"
description: "OpenSearch Anomaly Detection identifies atypical data and receives automatic
  notifications. There is an issue with the application of document and field level
  restrictions in the Anomaly Detection plugin, where users with the Anomaly Detector
  role can read aggregated numerical data (e.g. averages, sums) of fields that are
  otherwise restricted to them. This issue only affects authenticated users who were
  previously granted read access to the indexes containing the restricted fields.
  This issue has been patched in versions 1.3.8 and 2.6.0. There are no known workarounds
  for this issue."
