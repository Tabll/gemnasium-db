identifier: "CVE-2015-3224"
package_slug: "gem/web-console"
title: "Permissive List of Allowed Inputs"
description: "Specially crafted remote requests can spoof their origin, bypassing
  the IP allowlist, in any environment where Web Console is enabled (development and
  test, by default). Users whose application is only accessible from localhost (as
  is the default behaviour in Rails 4.2) are not affected, unless a local proxy is
  involved. All affected users should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds
  immediately. To work around this issue, turn off web-console in all environments,
  by removing/commenting it from the application's Gemfile."
