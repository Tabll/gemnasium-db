title: "Remote code execution"
description: "The package lz4-ruby is vulnerable to an integer overflow attack. When
  certain payloads are processed, a pointer to an output buffer can be set to an address
  outside the output buffer. Since the attacker can specify exact offsets in memory,
  it is very easy to create a reliable Remote Code Execution exploit. 32bit variants
  of the package are critically affected. 64bit variants are deemed infeasible to
  exploit."
