title: "Puma's header normalization allows for client to clobber proxy set headers"
description: "Clients could clobber values set by intermediate proxies (such as X-Forwarded-For)
  by providing a underscore version of the same header (X-Forwarded_For). Any users
  trusting headers set by their proxy may be affected. Attackers may be able to downgrade
  connections to HTTP (non-SSL) or redirect responses, which could cause confidentiality
  leaks if combined with a separate MITM attack."
