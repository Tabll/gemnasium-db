title: "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')"
description: "Puma is a web server for Ruby/Rack applications built for parallelism.
  Prior to version 6.4.2, puma exhibited incorrect behavior when parsing chunked transfer
  encoding bodies in a way that allowed HTTP request smuggling. Fixed versions limits
  the size of chunk extensions. Without this limit, an attacker could cause unbounded
  resource (CPU, network bandwidth) consumption. This vulnerability has been fixed
  in versions 6.4.2 and 5.6.8.\n\n"
