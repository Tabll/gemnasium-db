identifier: "CVE-2020-5247"
package_slug: "gem/puma"
title: "Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers"
description: "In Puma (RubyGem), if an application using Puma allows untrusted input
  in a response header, an attacker can use newline characters (i.e. `CR`, `LF` or`/r`,
  `/n`) to end the header and inject malicious content, such as additional headers
  or an entirely new response body. This vulnerability is known as HTTP Response Splitting.
  While not an attack in itself, response splitting is a vector for several other
  attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS)."
