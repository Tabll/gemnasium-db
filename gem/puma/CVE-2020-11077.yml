identifier: "CVE-2020-11077"
package_slug: "gem/puma"
title: "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests (HTTP Request Smuggling)"
description: " In Puma (RubyGem), a client could smuggle a request through a proxy,
  causing the proxy to send a response back to another unknown client. If the proxy
  uses persistent connections and the client adds another request in via HTTP pipelining,
  the proxy may mistake it as the first request's body. Puma, however, would see it
  as two requests, and when processing the second request, send back a response that
  the proxy does not expect. If the proxy has reused the persistent connection to
  Puma to send another request for a different client, the second response from the
  first client will be sent to the second client."
