identifier: "CVE-2020-5249"
package_slug: "gem/puma"
title: "Injection Vulnerability"
description: "In Puma (RubyGem), if an application using Puma allows untrusted input
  in an early-hints header, an attacker can use a carriage return character to end
  the header and inject malicious content, such as additional headers or an entirely
  new response body. This vulnerability is known as HTTP Response Splitting. While
  not an attack in itself, response splitting is a vector for several other attacks,
  such as cross-site scripting (XSS)."
