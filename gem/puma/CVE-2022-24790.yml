title: "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request Smuggling')"
description: "Puma is a simple, fast, multi-threaded, parallel HTTP 1.1 server for
  Ruby/Rack applications. When using Puma behind a proxy that does not properly validate
  that the incoming HTTP request matches the RFC7230 standard, Puma and the frontend
  proxy may disagree on where a request starts and ends. This would allow requests
  to be smuggled via the front-end proxy to Puma. The vulnerability has been fixed
  in 5.6.4 and 4.3.12. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. Workaround:
  when deploying a proxy in front of Puma, turning on any and all functionality to
  make sure that the request matches the RFC7230 standard."
