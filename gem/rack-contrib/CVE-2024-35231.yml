package_slug: "gem/rack-contrib"
title: "rack-contrib vulnerable to Denial of Service due to the unconstrained value
  of the incoming \"profiler_runs\" parameter"
description: "The next ruby code is vulnerable to denial of service due to the fact
  that the user controlled data `profiler_runs` was not contrained to any limitation.
  Which would lead to allocating resources on the server side with no limitation (CWE-770).\n\n```ruby\nruns
  = (request.params['profiler_runs'] || @times).to_i\nresult = @profile.profile do\nruns.times
  { @app.call(env) }\nend\n```\n\nAn exploit as such `curl --fail \"http://127.0.0.1:9292/?profiler_runs=9999999999&profile=process_time\"`
  may cause resource exhaution by a remotely controlled value."
