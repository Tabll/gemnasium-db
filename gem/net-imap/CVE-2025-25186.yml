description: "There is a possibility for denial of service by memory exhaustion in
  `net-imap`'s response parser.  At any time while the client is connected, a malicious

  read by the client's receiver thread.  The response parser uses `Range#to_a` to
  convert the `uid-set` data into arrays of integers, with no limitation on the expanded
  size of the ranges."
