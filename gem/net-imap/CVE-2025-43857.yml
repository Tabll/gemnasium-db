title: "net-imap rubygem vulnerable to possible DoS by memory exhaustion"
description: "There is a possibility for denial of service by memory exhaustion when
  `net-imap` reads server responses.  At any time while the client is connected, a
  malicious server can send can send a \"literal\" byte count, which is automatically
  read by the client's receiver thread.  The response reader immediately allocates
  memory for the number of bytes indicated by the server response.\n\nThis should
  not be an issue when securely connecting to trusted IMAP servers that are well-behaved.
  \ It can affect insecure connections and buggy, untrusted, or compromised servers
  (for example, connecting to a user supplied hostname)."
