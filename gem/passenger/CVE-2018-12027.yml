title: "Information Exposure"
description: "Given a Passenger-spawned application process that reports that it listens

  are writable by a normal user that is not the application's user, then that non-application
  user can swap that directory with something else, resulting in traffic being redirected
  to a non-application user's process through an alternative Unix domain socket."
