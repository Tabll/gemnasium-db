identifier: "CVE-2018-12029"
package_slug: "gem/passenger"
title: "Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization (Race
  Condition)"
description: "A race condition in the nginx module in Phusion Passenger allows local
  escalation of privileges when a non-standard `passenger_instance_registry_dir` with
  insufficiently strict permissions is configured. Replacing a file with a symlink
  after the file was created, but before it was chowned, leads to the target of the
  link being chowned via the path. Targeting sensitive files such as root's crontab
  file allows privilege escalation."
