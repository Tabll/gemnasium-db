identifier: "CVE-2015-7519"
package_slug: "gem/passenger"
title: "Header overwriting"
description: "It is possible in some cases, for clients to overwrite headers set by
  the server, resulting in a medium level security issue. Passenger 5 uses an SCGI-inspired
  format to pass headers to Ruby/Python applications, while Passenger 4 uses an SCGI-inspired
  format to pass headers to all applications. This implies a conversion to UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES
  whereby the difference between characters like '-' and '_' is lost. See \"Affected
  use-cases\" in provided link to establish wether one particular application is affected."
