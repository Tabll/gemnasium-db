title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "rails_multisite provides multi-db support for Rails applications.Depending
  on how the application makes use of these cookies, it may be possible for an attacker
  to re-use cookies on different 'sites' within a multi-site Rails application. The
  issue has been patched in v4 of the `rails_multisite` gem. Note that this upgrade
  will invalidate all previous signed/encrypted cookies. The impact of this invalidation
  will vary based on the application architecture."
