title: "URL Redirection to Untrusted Site (Open Redirect)"
description: "The Host Authorization middleware in Action Pack suffers from an open
  redirect vulnerability. Specially crafted `Host` headers in combination with certain
  \"allowed host\" formats can cause the Host Authorization middleware in Action Pack
  to redirect users to a malicious website. Impacted applications will have allowed
  hosts with a leading dot. When an allowed host contains a leading dot, a specially
  crafted `Host` header can be used to redirect to a malicious website."
