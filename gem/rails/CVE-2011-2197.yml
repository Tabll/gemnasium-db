title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "The cross-site scripting (XSS) prevention feature in Ruby on Rails 2.x
  before 2.3.12, 3.0.x before 3.0.8, and 3.1.x before 3.1.0.rc2 does not properly
  handle mutation of safe buffers, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct
  XSS attacks via crafted strings to an application that uses a problematic string
  method, as demonstrated by the sub method."
