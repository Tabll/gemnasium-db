title: "URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')"
description: "An open redirect vulnerability is fixed in Rails 7.0.4.1 with the new
  protection against open redirects from calling redirect_to with untrusted user input.
  In prior versions the developer was fully responsible for only providing trusted
  input. However the check introduced could allow an attacker to bypass with a carefully
  crafted URL resulting in an open redirect vulnerability."
