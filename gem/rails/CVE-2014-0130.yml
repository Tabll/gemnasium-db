package_slug: "gem/rails"
title: "Directory Traversal Vulnerability With Certain Route Configurations"
description: "The implicit render functionality allows controllers to render a template,
  even if there is no explicit action with the corresponding name. This module does
  not perform adequate input sanitization which could allow an attacker to use a specially
  crafted request to retrieve arbitrary files from the RoR application server."
