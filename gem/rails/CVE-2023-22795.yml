title: "Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity"
description: "A regular expression based DoS vulnerability in Action Dispatch <6.1.7.1
  and <7.0.4.1 related to the If-None-Match header. A specially crafted HTTP If-None-Match
  header can cause the regular expression engine to enter a state of catastrophic
  backtracking, when on a version of Ruby below 3.2.0. This can cause the process
  to use large amounts of CPU and memory, leading to a possible DoS vulnerability
  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds
  immediately."
