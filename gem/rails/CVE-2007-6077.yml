title: "Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race
  Condition')"
description: "The session fixation protection mechanism in cgi_process.rb in Rails
  1.2.4, as used in Ruby on Rails, removes the :cookie_only attribute from the DEFAULT_SESSION_OPTIONS
  constant, which effectively causes cookie_only to be applied only to the first instantiation
  of CgiRequest, which allows remote attackers to conduct session fixation attacks.
  \ NOTE: this is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2007-5380."
