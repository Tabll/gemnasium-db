package_slug: "gem/rails"
title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "The PostgreSQL adapter in Active Record suffers from a regular expression
  denial of service (REDoS) vulnerability. Carefully crafted input can cause the input
  validation in the `money` type of the PostgreSQL adapter in Active Record to spend
  too much time in a regular expression, resulting in the potential for a DoS attack.
  This only impacts Rails applications that are using PostgreSQL along with money
  type columns that take user input."
