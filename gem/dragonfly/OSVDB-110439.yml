title: "Remote Code Execution"
description: "The gem contains a flaw in Uploading & Processing that is due to the
  gem failing to restrict arbitrary commands to imagemagicks convert. This may allow
  a remote attacker to gain read/write access to the filesystem and execute arbitrary
  commands. "

affected_range: "<1.0.7"
fixed_versions:
- "1.0.7"
affected_versions: "All versions before 1.0.7"
solution: "Upgrade to version 1.0.7, or higher, to address this vulnerability. It
  is also possible to temporarily mitigate this issue by implementing the following
  workaround: version 1.0.6 introduced the HMAC signing feature which prevents this
  issue, but it was not enabled by default. 1.0.7 enables it by default."
