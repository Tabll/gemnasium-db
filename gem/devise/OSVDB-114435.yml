title: "CSRF token fixation attacks"
description: "Devise has been reported to be vulnerable to CSRF token fixation attacks.
  The attack can only be exploited if the attacker can set the target session, either
  by subdomain cookies or by fixation over the same Wi-Fi network. If the user knows
  the CSRF token, cross-site forgery requests can be made."
