identifier: "CVE-2015-8314"
package_slug: "gem/devise"
title: "Unauthorized Access Using remember-me Cookie"
description: "Devise uses cookies to implement a remember-me functionality. However,
  it generates the same cookie for all devices. If an attacker manages to steal a
  remember-me cookie and the user does not change the password frequently, the cookie
  can be used to gain access to the application indefinitely. The bug can only be
  exploited if the attacker can steal cookies in the first place."
