title: "Spree Commerce is vulnerable to RCE through Search API"
description: "Spreecommerce versions prior to 0.50.x contain a remote command execution
  vulnerability in the API's search functionality. Improper input sanitation allows
  attackers to inject arbitrary shell commands via the search[instance_eval] parameter,
  which is dynamically invoked using Ruby’s send method. This flaw enables unauthenticated
  attackers to execute commands on the server."
