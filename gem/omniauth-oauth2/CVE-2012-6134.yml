identifier: "CVE-2012-6134"
package_slug: "gem/omniauth-oauth2"
title: "CSRF vulnerability, injecting state in session"
description: "The package omniauth-oauth2 for Ruby contains a flaw related to `omniauth.state`
  that allows a remote attacker to conduct a session injection attack. This flaw exists
  because the application, when establishing a new session, does not invalidate an
  existing session identifier and assign a new one. With a specially crafted request
  fixating the session identifier, a context-dependent attacker can ensure a user
  authenticates with the known session identifier, allowing the session to be subsequently
  hijacked."
