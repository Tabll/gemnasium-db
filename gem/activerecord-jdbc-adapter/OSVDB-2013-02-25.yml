title: "SQL Injection"
description: "ActiveRecord-JDBC-Adapter (AR-JDBC) contains a flaw that may allow carrying
  out an SQL injection attack. The issue is due to the `sql.gsub()` function in
  `lib/arjdbc/jdbc/adapter.rb` not properly sanitizing user-supplied input
  before using it in SQL queries. This may allow a remote attacker to inject or
  manipulate SQL queries in the back-end database, allowing for the
  manipulation or disclosure of arbitrary data."
