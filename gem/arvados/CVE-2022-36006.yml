title: "Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')"
description: "Arvados is an open source platform for managing, processing, and sharing
  genomic and other large scientific and biomedical data. A remote code execution
  (RCE) vulnerability in the Arvados Workbench allows authenticated attackers to execute
  arbitrary code via specially crafted JSON payloads. This exists in all versions
  up to 2.4.1 and is fixed in 2.4.2. This vulnerability is specific to the Ruby on
  Rails Workbench application (“Workbench 1”). We do not believe any other Arvados
  components, including the TypesScript browser-based Workbench application (“Workbench
  2”) or API Server, is vulnerable to this attack. For versions of Arvados earlier
  than 2.4.2: remove the Ruby-based \"Workbench 1\" app (\"apt-get remove arvados-workbench\")
  from your installation as a workaround."
