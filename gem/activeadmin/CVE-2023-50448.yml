title: "Potential CSV export data leak"
description: "### Impact\n\nIn ActiveAdmin versions prior to 2.12.0, a concurrency
  issue was found that could allow a malicious actor to be able to access potentially
  private data that belongs to another user.\n\nThe bug affects the functionality
  to export data as CSV files, and was caused by a variable holding the collection
  to be exported being shared across threads and not properly synchronized.\n\nThe
  attacker would need access to the same ActiveAdmin application as the victim, and
  could exploit the issue by timing their request immediately before when they know
  someone else will request a CSV (e.g. via phishing) or request CSVs frequently and
  hope someone else makes a concurrent request.\n\n### Patches\n\nVersions 2.12.0
  and above fixed the problem by completely removing the shared state."
