title: "activeadmin vulnerable to stored persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) in
  dynamic form legends"
description: "Users settings their active admin form legends dynamically may be vulnerable
  to stored XSS, as long as its value can be injected directly by a malicious user.\n\nFor
  example:\n\n* A public web application allows users to create entities with arbitrary
  names.\n* Active Admin is used to administrate these entities through a private
  backend.\n* The form to edit these entities in the private backend has the following
  shape (note the dynamic `name` value dependent on an attribute of the `resource`):\n\n```ruby\nform
  do |f|\nf.inputs name: resource.name do\nf.input :name\nf.input :description\nend\n\nf.actions\nend\n```\n\nThen
  a malicious user could create an entity with a payload that would get executed in
  the active admin administrator's browser.\n\nBoth `form` blocks with an implicit
  or explicit name (i.e., both `form resource.name` or `form name: resource.name`
  would suffer from the problem), where the value of the name can be arbitrarily set
  by non admin users."
