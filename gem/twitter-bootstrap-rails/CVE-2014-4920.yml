identifier: "CVE-2014-4920"
package_slug: "gem/twitter-bootstrap-rails"
title: "Reflective XSS Vulnerability"
description: "The gem contains a flaw that enables a reflected cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attack. This flaw exists because the bootstrap_flash helper method does not
  validate input when handling flash messages before returning it to users. This may
  allow a context-dependent attacker to create a specially crafted request that would
  execute arbitrary script code in a user's browser session within the trust relationship
  between their browser and the server. "
