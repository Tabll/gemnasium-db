package_slug: "gem/activesupport"
title: "XML Parsing Vulnerability affecting JRuby users"
description: "There is a vulnerability in the JDOM backend to ActiveSupport's XML
  parser. This could allow an attacker to perform a denial of service attack or gain
  access to files stored on the application server. The ActiveSupport XML parsing
  functionality supports multiple pluggable backends. One backend supported for JRuby
  users is `ActiveSupport::XmlMini_JDOM` which makes use of the `javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilder`
  class. In some JVM configurations the default settings of that class can allow an
  attacker to construct XML which, when parsed, will contain the contents of arbitrary
  URLs including files from the application server. They may also allow for various
  denial of service attacks. If you are using JRuby and have an affected JVM, you
  should upgrade or use one of the work arounds immediately."
