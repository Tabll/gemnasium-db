identifier: "CVE-2015-3226"
package_slug: "gem/activesupport"
title: "XSS Vulnerability in ActiveSupport::JSON.encode"
description: "When a `Hash` containing user-controlled data is encoded as JSON (either
  through `Hash#to_json` or `ActiveSupport::JSON.encode`), Rails does not perform
  adequate escaping that matches the guarantee implied by the `escape_html_entities_in_json`
  option (which is enabled by default). If this resulting JSON string is subsequently
  inserted directly into an HTML page, the page will be vulnerable to XSS attacks."
