title: "ActiveSupport potentially unintended unmarshalling of user-provided objects
  in MemCacheStore and RedisCacheStore"
description: "In ActiveSupport, there is potentially unexpected behaviour in the MemCacheStore
  and RedisCacheStore where, when\nuntrusted user input is written to the cache store
  using the `raw: true` parameter, re-reading the result\nfrom the cache can evaluate
  the user input as a Marshalled object instead of plain text. Vulnerable code looks
  like:\n\n```\ndata = cache.fetch(\"demo\", raw: true) { untrusted_string }\n```\nVersions
  Affected:  rails < 5.2.5, rails < 6.0.4\nNot affected:       Applications not using
  MemCacheStore or RedisCacheStore. Applications that do not use the `raw` option
  when storing untrusted user input.\nFixed Versions:     rails >= 5.2.4.3, rails
  >= 6.0.3.1\n\nImpact\n------\nUnmarshalling of untrusted user input can have impact
  up to and including RCE. At a minimum,\nthis vulnerability allows an attacker to
  inject untrusted Ruby objects into a web application.\nIn addition to upgrading
  to the latest versions of Rails, developers should ensure that whenever\nthey are
  calling `Rails.cache.fetch` they are using consistent values of the `raw` parameter
  for both\nreading and writing, especially in the case of the RedisCacheStore which
  does not, prior to these changes,\ndetect if data was serialized using the raw option
  upon deserialization.\n\nWorkarounds\n-----------\nIt is recommended that application
  developers apply the suggested patch or upgrade to the latest release as\nsoon as
  possible. If this is not possible, we recommend ensuring that all user-provided
  strings cached using\nthe `raw` argument should be double-checked to ensure that
  they conform to the expected format."
