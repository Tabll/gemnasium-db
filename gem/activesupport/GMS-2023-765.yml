title: "Possible XSS Security Vulnerability in SafeBuffer#bytesplice"
description: "There is a vulnerability in ActiveSupport if the new bytesplice method
  is called on a SafeBuffer with untrusted user input.\nThis vulnerability has been
  assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2023-28120.\n\nVersions Affected: All. Not affected:
  None Fixed Versions: 7.0.4.3, 6.1.7.3\n\n# Impact\n\nActiveSupport uses the SafeBuffer
  string subclass to tag strings as html_safe after they have been sanitized.\nWhen
  these strings are mutated, the tag is should be removed to mark them as no longer
  being html_safe.\n\nRuby 3.2 introduced a new bytesplice method which ActiveSupport
  does not yet understand to be a mutation.\nUsers on older versions of Ruby are likely
  unaffected.\n\nAll users running an affected release and using bytesplice should
  either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.\n\n# Workarounds\n\nAvoid
  calling bytesplice on a SafeBuffer (html_safe) string with untrusted user input.\n"
