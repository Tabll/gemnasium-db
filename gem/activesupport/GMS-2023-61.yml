title: "Duplicate of ./gem/activesupport/CVE-2023-22796.yml"
description: "There is a possible regular expression based DoS vulnerability in Active
  Support. A specially crafted string passed to the underscore method can cause the
  regular expression engine to enter a state of catastrophic backtracking. This can
  cause the process to use large amounts of CPU and memory, leading to a possible
  DoS vulnerability. This affects `String#underscore`, `ActiveSupport::Inflector.underscore`,
  `String#titleize`, and any other methods using these. All users running an affected
  release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately."
