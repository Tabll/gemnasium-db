package_slug: "gem/activesupport"
title: "Direct Manipulation XSS"
description: "Ruby on Rails contains a flaw that allows a remote cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attack. This flaw exists because the application does not validate direct
  manipulations of `SafeBuffer` objects via `'[]'` and other methods. This may allow
  a user to create a specially crafted request that would execute arbitrary script
  code in a user's browser within the trust relationship between their browser and
  the server. "
