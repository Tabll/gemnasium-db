identifier: "CVE-2020-5216"
package_slug: "gem/secure_headers"
title: "Injection Vulnerability"
description: "If user-supplied input is passed into `append/override_content_security_policy_directives`,
  a newline could be injected leading to limited header injection. Upon seeing a newline
  in the header, rails will silently create a new `Content-Security-Policy` header
  with the remaining value of the original string. It will continue to create new
  headers for each newline."
