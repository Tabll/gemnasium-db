package_slug: "gem/rack-cors"
title: "Improper Access Control"
description: "Missing anchor in generated regex for rack-cors allows a malicious third-party
  site to perform CORS requests. If the configuration were intended to allow only
  the trusted `example.com` domain name and not the malicious `example.net` domain
  name, then `example.com.example.net` (as well as `example.com-example.net)` would
  be inadvertently allowed."
