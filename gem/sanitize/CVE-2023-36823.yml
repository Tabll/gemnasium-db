package_slug: "gem/sanitize"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "Sanitize is an allowlist-based HTML and CSS sanitizer. Using carefully
  crafted input, an attacker may be able to sneak arbitrary HTML and CSS through Sanitize
  starting with version 3.0.0 and prior to version 6.0.2 when Sanitize is configured
  to use the built-in \"relaxed\" config or when using a custom config that allows
  `style` elements and one or more CSS at-rules. This could result in cross-site scripting
  or other undesired behavior when the malicious HTML and CSS are rendered in a browser.
  Sanitize 6.0.2 performs additional escaping of CSS in `style` element content, which
  fixes this issue. Users who are unable to upgrade can prevent this issue by using
  a Sanitize config that does not allow `style` elements, using a Sanitize config
  that does not allow CSS at-rules, or by manually escaping the character sequence
  `</` as `<\\/` in `style` element content."
