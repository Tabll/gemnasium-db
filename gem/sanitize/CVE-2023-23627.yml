title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "Sanitize is an allowlist-based HTML and CSS sanitizer. Versions 5.0.0
  and later, prior to 6.0.1, is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting. When Sanitize
  is configured with a custom allowlist that allows `noscript` elements, attackers
  are able to include arbitrary HTML, resulting in XSS (cross-site scripting) or other
  undesired behavior when that HTML is rendered in a browser. The default configurations
  do not allow `noscript` elements and are not vulnerable. This issue only affects
  users who are using a custom config that adds `noscript` to the element allowlist.
  This issue has been patched in version 6.0.1. Users who are unable to upgrade can
  prevent this issue by using one of Sanitize's default configs or by ensuring that
  their custom config does not include `noscript` in the element allowlist."
