identifier: "CVE-2021-28680"
identifiers:
- "CVE-2021-28680"
package_slug: "gem/devise_masquerade"
title: "Improper Access Control"
description: "The devise_masquerade gem allows certain attacks when a password's salt
  is unknown. An application that uses this gem to let administrators masquerade/impersonate
  users loses one layer of security protection compared to a situation where Devise
  (without this extension) is used. If the server-side `secret_key_base` value became
  publicly known (for instance if it is committed to a public repository by mistake),
  there are still other protections in place that prevent an attacker from impersonating
  any user on the site. When masquerading is not used in a plain Devise application,
  one must know the password salt of the target user if one wants to encrypt and sign
  a valid session cookie. When devise_masquerade is used, however, an attacker can
  decide which user the `back` action will go back to without knowing that user's
  password salt and simply knowing the user ID, by manipulating the session cookie
  and pretending that a user is already masqueraded by an administrator."
