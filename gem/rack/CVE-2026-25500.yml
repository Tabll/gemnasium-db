title: "Stored XSS in Rack::Directory via javascript: filenames rendered into anchor
  href"
description: "`Rack::Directory` generates an HTML directory index where each file
  entry is rendered as a clickable link. If a file exists on disk whose basename begins
  with the `javascript:` scheme (e.g. `javascript:alert(1)`), the generated index
  includes an anchor whose `href` attribute is exactly `javascript:alert(1)`. Clicking
  this entry executes arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the hosting application.\n\nThis
  results in a client-side XSS condition in directory listings generated by `Rack::Directory`."
