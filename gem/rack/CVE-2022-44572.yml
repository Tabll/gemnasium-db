description: "A denial of service vulnerability in the multipart parsing component
  of Rack fixed in 2.0.9.2, 2.1.4.2, 2.2.4.1 and 3.0.0.1 could allow an attacker tocraft
  input that can cause RFC2183 multipart boundary parsing in Rack to take an unexpected
  amount of time, possibly resulting in a denial of service attack vector. Any applications
  that parse multipart posts using Rack (virtually all Rails applications) are impacted."
