title: "Possible Denial of Service Vulnerability in Rackâ€™s header parsing"
description: "There is a denial of service vulnerability in the header parsing component
  of Rack. Carefully crafted input can cause header parsing in Rack to take an unexpected 
  amount of time, possibly resulting in a denial of service attack vector. Any applications 
  that parse headers using Rack (virtually all Rails applications) are impacted. Workarounds
  Setting `Regexp.timeout` in Ruby 3.2 is a possible workaround."
