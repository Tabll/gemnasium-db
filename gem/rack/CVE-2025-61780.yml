title: "Rack has a Possible Information Disclosure Vulnerability"
description: "A possible information disclosure vulnerability existed in `Rack::Sendfile`
  when running behind a proxy that supports `x-sendfile` headers (such as Nginx).
  Specially crafted headers could cause `Rack::Sendfile` to miscommunicate with the
  proxy and trigger unintended internal requests, potentially bypassing proxy-level
  access restrictions."
