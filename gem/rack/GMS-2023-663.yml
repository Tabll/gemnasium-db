title: "Rack has possible DoS Vulnerability in Multipart MIME parsing"
description: "There is a possible DoS vulnerability in the Multipart MIME parsing
  code in Rack. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2023-27530.\n\nVersions
  Affected: All. Not affected: None Fixed Versions: 3.0.4.2, 2.2.6.3, 2.1.4.3, 2.0.9.3\n\n#
  Impact\nThe Multipart MIME parsing code in Rack limits the number of file parts,
  but does not limit the total number of parts that can be uploaded. Carefully crafted
  requests can abuse this and cause multipart parsing to take longer than expected.\n\nAll
  users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds
  immediately.\n\n# Workarounds\nA proxy can be configured to limit the POST body
  size which will mitigate this issue.\n"
