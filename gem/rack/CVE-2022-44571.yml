title: "Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity"
description: "There is a denial of service vulnerability in the Content-Disposition
  parsingcomponent of Rack fixed in 2.0.9.2, 2.1.4.2, 2.2.4.1, 3.0.0.1. This could
  allow an attacker to craft an input that can cause Content-Disposition header parsing
  in Rackto take an unexpected amount of time, possibly resulting in a denial ofservice
  attack vector. This header is used typically used in multipartparsing. Any applications
  that parse multipart posts using Rack (virtuallyall Rails applications) are impacted."
