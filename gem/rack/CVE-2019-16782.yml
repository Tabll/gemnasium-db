identifier: "CVE-2019-16782"
package_slug: "gem/rack"
title: "Information Exposure"
description: "There's a possible information leak / session hijack vulnerability in
  Rack (RubyGem rack). Attackers may be able to find and hijack sessions by using
  timing attacks targeting the session id. Session ids are usually stored and indexed
  in a database that uses some kind of scheme for speeding up lookups of that session
  id. By carefully measuring the amount of time it takes to look up a session, an
  attacker may be able to find a valid session id and hijack the session. The session
  id itself may be generated randomly, but the way the session is indexed by the backing
  store does not use a secure comparison."
