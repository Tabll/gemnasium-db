title: "Rack's unbounded multipart preamble buffering enables DoS (memory exhaustion)"
description: "`Rack::Multipart::Parser` buffers the entire multipart **preamble**
  (bytes before the first boundary) in memory without any size limit. A client can
  send a large preamble followed by a valid boundary, causing significant memory use
  and potential process termination due to out-of-memory (OOM) conditions."
