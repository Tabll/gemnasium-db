title: "Rack: Multipart parser buffers large nonâ€‘file fields entirely in memory, enabling
  DoS (memory exhaustion)"
description: "`Rack::Multipart::Parser` stores non-file form fields (parts without
  a `filename`) entirely in memory as Ruby `String` objects. A single large text field
  in a multipart/form-data request (hundreds of megabytes or more) can consume equivalent
  process memory, potentially leading to out-of-memory (OOM) conditions and denial
  of service (DoS)."
