title: "Rack's multipart parser buffers unbounded per-part headers, enabling DoS (memory
  exhaustion)"
description: "`Rack::Multipart::Parser` can accumulate unbounded data when a multipart
  partâ€™s header block never terminates with the required blank line (`CRLFCRLF`).
  The parser keeps appending incoming bytes to memory without a size cap, allowing
  a remote attacker to exhaust memory and cause a denial of service (DoS)."
