package_slug: "gem/rack"
title: "Rack is vulnerable to a memory-exhaustion DoS through unbounded URL-encoded
  body parsing"
description: "`Rack::Request#POST` reads the entire request body into memory for `Content-Type:
  application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, calling `rack.input.read(nil)` without enforcing
  a length or cap. Large request bodies can therefore be buffered completely into
  process memory before parsing, leading to denial of service (DoS) through memory
  exhaustion."
