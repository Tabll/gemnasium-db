title: "Rack has an unsafe default in Rack::QueryParser allows params_limit bypass
  via semicolon-separated parameters"
description: "`Rack::QueryParser` in version `< 2.2.18` enforces its `params_limit`
  only for parameters separated by `&`, while still splitting on both `&` and `;`.
  As a result, attackers could use `;` separators to bypass the parameter count limit
  and submit more parameters than intended."
