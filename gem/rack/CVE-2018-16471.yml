identifier: "CVE-2018-16471"
package_slug: "gem/rack"
title: "Cross-site Scripting"
description: "There is a possible XSS vulnerability in Rack. Carefully crafted requests
  can impact the data returned by the `scheme` method on `Rack::Request`. Applications
  that expect the scheme to be limited to HTTP or HTTPS and do not escape the return
  value could be vulnerable to an XSS attack. Note that applications using the normal
  escaping mechanisms provided by Rails may not be impacted, but applications that
  bypass the escaping mechanisms, or do not use them may be vulnerable."
