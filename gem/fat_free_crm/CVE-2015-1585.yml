identifier: "CVE-2015-1585"
package_slug: "gem/fat_free_crm"
title: "CSRF vulnerability"
description: "There's a flaw as HTTP requests to /admin/users do not require multiple
  steps, explicit confirmation, or a unique token when performing certain sensitive
  actions. By tricking a user into following a specially crafted link, a context-dependent
  attacker can perform a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF / XSRF) attack causing the
  victim to creating administrative users."
