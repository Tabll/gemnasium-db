identifier: "CVE-2013-0269"
package_slug: "gem/json"
title: "Denial of Service and Unsafe Object Creation Vulnerability"
description: "When parsing certain JSON documents, the JSON gem can be coerced in
  to creating Ruby symbols in a target system. Since Ruby symbols are not garbage
  collected, this can result in a denial of service attack. The same technique can
  be used to create objects in a target system that act like internal objects. These
  \"act alike\" objects can be used to bypass certain security mechanisms and can
  be used as a spring board for SQL injection attacks in Ruby on Rails."
