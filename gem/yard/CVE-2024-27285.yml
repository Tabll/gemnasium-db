title: "YARD's default template vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting in generated frames.html"
description: "### Summary\nThe \"frames.html\" file within the Yard Doc's generated
  documentation is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to inadequate
  sanitization of user input within the JavaScript segment of the \"frames.erb\" template
  file.\n\n### Details\nThe vulnerability stems from mishandling user-controlled data
  retrieved from the URL hash in the embedded JavaScript code within the \"frames.erb\"
  template file. Specifically, the script lacks proper sanitization of the hash data
  before utilizing it to establish the top-level window's location. This oversight
  permits an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript payloads through carefully crafted
  URLs.\n\nSnippet from \"frames.erb\":\n(v0.9.34)\n```erb\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n
  \ var match = unescape(window.location.hash).match(/^#!(.+)/);\n  var name = match
  ? match[1] : '<%= url_for_main %>';\n  name = name.replace(/^(\\w+):\\/\\//, '').replace(/^\\/\\//,
  '');\n  window.top.location = name;\n</script>\n```\n\n(v0.9.35)\n```erb\n<script
  type=\"text/javascript\">\n  var match = decodeURIComponent(window.location.hash).match(/^#!(.+)/);\n
  \ var name = match ? match[1] : '<%= url_for_main %>';\n  name = name.replace(/^((\\w*):)?[\\/\\\\]*/gm,
  '').trim();\n  window.top.location.replace(name)\n</script>\n```\n\n### PoC (Proof
  of Concept)\nTo exploit this vulnerability:\n1. Gain access to the generated Yard
  Doc.\n2. Locate and access the \"frames.html\" file.\n3. Construct a URL containing
  the malicious payload in the hash segment, for instance: `#!javascript:xss` for
  v0.9.34, and `#:javascript:xss` for v0.9.35\n\n### Impact\nThis XSS vulnerability
  presents a substantial threat by enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript
  code within the user's session context. Potential ramifications include session
  hijacking, theft of sensitive data, unauthorized access to user accounts, and defacement
  of websites. Any user visiting the compromised page is susceptible to exploitation.
  It is critical to promptly address this vulnerability to mitigate potential harm
  to users and preserve the application's integrity."
