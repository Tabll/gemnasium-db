identifier: "CVE-2012-6708"
package_slug: "gem/rdoc"
title: "Cross-site Scripting"
description: "The jQuery library, which is included in rdoc, is vulnerable to Cross-site
  Scripting (XSS) attacks. The `jQuery(strInput)` function does not differentiate
  selectors from HTML. In vulnerable versions, jQuery determined whether the input
  was HTML by looking for the `<` character anywhere in the string, giving attackers
  more flexibility when attempting to construct a malicious payload. In fixed versions,
  jQuery only deems the input to be HTML if it explicitly starts with the `<` character,
  limiting exploitability only to attackers who can control the beginning of a string,
  which is far less common."
