identifier: "CVE-2012-6708"
package_slug: "gem/rdoc"
title: "Cross-site Scripting"
description: "The jQuery library, which is included in rdoc, is vulnerable to Cross-site
  Scripting (XSS) attacks. jQuery only deems the input to be HTML if it explicitly
  starts with the `<` character, limiting exploitability only to attackers who can
  control the beginning of a string, which is far less common."
