identifier: "CVE-2018-16395"
package_slug: "gem/openssl"
title: "Improper Certificate Validation"
description: "When two `OpenSSL::X509::Name` objects are compared using `==`, depending
  on the ordering, non-equal objects may return true. When the first argument is one
  character longer than the second, or the second argument contains a character that
  is one less than a character in the same position of the first argument, the result
  of `==` will be true. This could be leveraged to create an illegitimate certificate
  that may be accepted as legitimate and then used in signing or encryption operations."
