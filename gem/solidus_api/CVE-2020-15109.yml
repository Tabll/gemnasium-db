identifier: "CVE-2020-15109"
package_slug: "gem/solidus_api"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "This vulnerability allows a malicious customer to craft request data
  with parameters that allow changing the address of the current order without changing
  the shipment costs associated with the new shipment. All stores with at least two
  shipping zones and different costs of shipment per zone are impacted. This problem
  comes from how checkout permitted attributes are structured. We have a single list
  of attributes that are permitted across the whole checkout, no matter the step that
  is being submitted."
