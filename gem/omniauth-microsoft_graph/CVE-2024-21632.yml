package_slug: "gem/omniauth-microsoft_graph"
title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "omniauth-microsoft_graph provides an Omniauth strategy for the Microsoft
  Graph API. Prior to versions 2.0.0, the implementation does not validate the legitimacy
  of the `email` attribute of the user nor did it give/document an option to do so,
  making it susceptible to nOAuth misconfiguration in cases when the `email` is used
  as a trusted user identifier. This could lead to account takeover. Version 2.0.0
  contains a fix for this issue.\n"
