title: "Malicious Package"
description: "An unauthenticated attacker can craft the `___cfduid` cookie value with
  base64 arbitrary code to be executed via `eval()`, which can be leveraged to execute
  arbitrary code on the target system. Note that there are three underscore characters
  in the cookie name. This is unrelated to the `__cfduid` cookie that is legitimately
  used by Cloudflare."
