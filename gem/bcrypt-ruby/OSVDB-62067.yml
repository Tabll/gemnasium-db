title: "Bug reduced the entropy of hashed passwords containing non US-ASCII characters"
description: "This package suffered from a bug related to character encoding that
  substantially reduced the entropy of hashed passwords containing non US-ASCII characters.
  An incorrect encoding step transparently replaced such characters by '?' prior to
  hashing. In the worst case of a password consisting solely of non-US-ASCII characters,
  this would cause its hash to be equivalent to all other such passwords of the same
  length. This issue only affects the JRuby implementation."
