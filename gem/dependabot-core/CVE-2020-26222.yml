identifier: "CVE-2020-26222"
package_slug: "gem/dependabot-core"
title: "Injection Vulnerability"
description: "Dependabot is a set of packages for automated dependency management
  for Ruby, JavaScript, Python, PHP, Elixir, Rust, Java, .NET, Elm and Go. In Dependabot-Core
  from beta1, there is a remote code execution vulnerability in dependabot-common
  and dependabot-go_modules when a source branch name contains malicious injectable
  bash code. For example, if Dependabot is configured to use the following source
  branch name: `/$({curl,127.0.0.1})`, Dependabot will make a HTTP request to the
  following URL: `127.0.0.1` when cloning the source repository. As a workaround,
  one can escape the branch name prior to passing it to the `Dependabot::Source` class."
