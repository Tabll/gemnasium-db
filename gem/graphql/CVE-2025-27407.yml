title: "graphql allows remote code execution when loading a crafted GraphQL schema"
description: "Loading a malicious schema definition in `GraphQL::Schema.from_introspection`
  (or `GraphQL::Schema::Loader.load`) can result in remote code execution. Any system
  which loads a schema by JSON from an untrusted source is vulnerable, including those
  that use [GraphQL::Client](https://github.com/github-community-projects/graphql-client)
  to load external schemas via GraphQL introspection."
