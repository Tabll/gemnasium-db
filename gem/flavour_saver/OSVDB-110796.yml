title: "Remote code execution via handlebars helper"
description: "The gem contains a flaw in helper method dispatch where it uses Kernel::send
  to call helpers without checking that they are defined within the template context
  first. This allows expressions such as {{system \"ls\"}} or {{eval \"puts 1 + 1\"}}
  to be executed."
