identifier: "CVE-2014-0013"
package_slug: "gem/ember-source"
title: "Potential XSS Exploit With User-Supplied Data When Binding"
description: "In general, Ember.js escapes or strips any user-supplied content before
  inserting it in strings that will be sent to innerHTML. However, we have identified
  a vulnerability that could lead to unescaped content being inserted into the innerHTML
  string without being sanitized. When a primitive value is used as the Handlebars
  context, that value is not properly escaped. An example of this would be using the
  `{{each}}` helper to iterate over an array of user-supplied strings and using `{{this}}`
  inside the block to display each string. In applications that contain templates
  whose context is a primitive value and use the `{{this}}` keyword to display that
  value, a specially-crafted payload could execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context
  of the current domain (\"XSS\"). This vulnerability affects applications that contain
  templates whose context is set to a user-supplied primitive value (such as a string
  or number) and also contain the `{{this}}` special Handlebars variable to display
  the value."
