package_slug: "gem/ember-source"
title: "XSS Vulnerability With {{link-to}} Helper in Non-block Form"
description: "In general, Ember.js escapes or strips any user-supplied content before
  inserting it in strings that will be sent to `innerHTML`. However, a change made
  to the implementation of the `{{link-to}}` helper means that any user-supplied data
  bound to the `{{link-to}}` helper's title attribute will not be escaped correctly.
  In applications that use the `{{link-to}}` helper in non-block form and bind the
  title attribute to user-supplied content, a specially-crafted payload could execute
  arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the current domain (\"XSS\"). "
