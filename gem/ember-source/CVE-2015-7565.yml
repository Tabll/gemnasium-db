identifier: "CVE-2015-7565"
package_slug: "gem/ember-source"
title: "XSS Vulnerability with User-Supplied JSON"
description: "By default, Ember will escape any values in Handlebars templates that
  use double curlies (`{{value}}`). Developers can specifically opt out of this escaping
  behavior by passing an instance of `SafeString` rather than a raw string, which
  tells Ember that it should not escape the string because the developer has taken
  responsibility for escapement. It is possible for an attacker to create a specially-crafted
  payload that causes a non-sanitized string to be treated as a `SafeString`, and
  thus bypass Ember's normal escaping behavior. This could allow an attacker to execute
  arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the current domain (\"XSS\")."
