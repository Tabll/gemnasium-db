identifier: "CVE-2013-4170"
package_slug: "gem/ember-source"
title: "Potential XSS Exploit When Binding tagName to User-Supplied Data"
description: "In general, Ember.js escapes or strips any user-supplied content before
  inserting it in strings that will be sent to innerHTML. However, the `tagName` property
  of an `Ember.View` was inserted into such a string without being sanitized. This
  means that if an application assigns a view's `tagName` to user-supplied data, a
  specially-crafted payload could execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the
  current domain (\"XSS\"). This vulnerability only affects applications that assign
  or bind user-provided content to `tagName`."
