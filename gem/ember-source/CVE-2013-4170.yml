identifier: "CVE-2013-4170"
package_slug: "gem/ember-source"
title: "Potential XSS Exploit When Binding tagName to User-Supplied Data"
description: "In general, Ember.js escapes or strips any user-supplied content before
  inserting it in strings that will be sent to innerHTML. However, the
  `tagName` property of an `Ember.View` was inserted into such a string without
  being sanitized. This means that if an application assigns a view's `tagName`
  to user-supplied data, a specially-crafted payload could execute arbitrary
  JavaScript in the context of the current domain (\"XSS\"). This vulnerability
  only affects applications that assign or bind user-provided content to
  `tagName`."
