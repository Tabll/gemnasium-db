identifier: "CVE-2014-0014"
package_slug: "gem/ember-source"
title: "Potential XSS Exploit"
description: "In general, Ember.js escapes or strips any user-supplied content before
  inserting it in strings that will be sent to `innerHTML`. However, we have identified
  a vulnerability that could lead to unescaped content being inserted into the `innerHTML`
  string without being sanitized. When using the `{{group}}` helper, user supplied
  content in the template was not being sanitized. Though the vulnerability exists
  in Ember.js proper, it is only exposed via the use of an experimental plugin. In
  applications that use the `{{group}}` helper, a specially-crafted payload could
  execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the current domain (`XSS`). This
  vulnerability only affects applications that use the `{{group}}` helper to display
  user-provided content."
