identifier: "CVE-2015-1866"
package_slug: "gem/ember-source"
title: "Vulnerability With {{view \"select\"}} Options"
description: "In general, Ember.js escapes or strips any user-supplied content before
  inserting it in strings that will be sent to innerHTML. However, a change made to
  the implementation of the select view means that any user-supplied data bound to
  an option's label will not be escaped correctly. In applications that use Ember's
  select view and pass user-supplied content to the label, a specially-crafted payload
  could execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the current domain (\"XSS\")."
