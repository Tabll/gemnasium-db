package_slug: "gem/grpc"
title: "Connection confusion in gRPC"
description: "When gRPC HTTP2 stack raised a header size exceeded error, it skipped
  parsing the rest of the HPACK frame. This caused any HPACK table mutations to also
  be skipped, resulting in a desynchronization of HPACK tables between sender and
  receiver. If leveraged, say, between a proxy and a backend, this could lead to requests
  from the proxy being interpreted as containing headers from different proxy clients
  - leading to an information leak that can be used for privilege escalation or data
  exfiltration."
