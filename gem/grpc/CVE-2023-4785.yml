title: "Denial of Service Vulnerability in gRPC TCP Server (Posix-compatible platforms)"
description: "Lack of error handling in the TCP server in Google's gRPC starting version
  1.23 on posix-compatible platforms (ex. Linux) allows an attacker to cause a denial
  of service by initiating a significant number of connections with the server. Note
  that gRPC C++ Python, and Ruby are affected, but gRPC Java, and Go are NOT affected.Â "
