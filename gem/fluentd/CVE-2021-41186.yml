package_slug: "gem/fluentd"
title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "Fluentd collects events from various data sources and writes them to
  files to help unify logging infrastructure. The `parser_apache2` plugin in Fluentd
  suffers from a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS)
  vulnerability. A broken apache log with a certain pattern of string can spend too
  much time in a regular expression, resulting in the potential for a DoS attack.
  There are two workarounds available. Either don't use `parser_apache2`
  for parsing logs (which cannot guarantee generated by Apache), or put patched version
  of `parser_apache2.rb` into `/etc/fluent/plugin` directory (or any other directories
  specified by the environment variable `FLUENT_PLUGIN` or `--plugin` option of fluentd)."
