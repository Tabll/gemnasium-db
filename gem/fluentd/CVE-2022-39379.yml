title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command
  Injection')"
description: "Fluentd collects events from various data sources and writes them to
  files, RDBMS, NoSQL, IaaS, SaaS, Hadoop and so on. A remote code execution (RCE)
  vulnerability in non-default configurations of Fluentd allows unauthenticated attackers
  to execute arbitrary code via specially crafted JSON payloads. Fluentd setups are
  only affected if the environment variable `FLUENT_OJ_OPTION_MODE` is explicitly
  set to `object`. Please note: The option FLUENT_OJ_OPTION_MODE was introduced in
  Fluentd version 1.13.2. Earlier versions of Fluentd are not affected by this vulnerability.
  This issue was patched in version 1.15.3. As a workaround do not use `FLUENT_OJ_OPTION_MODE=object`."
