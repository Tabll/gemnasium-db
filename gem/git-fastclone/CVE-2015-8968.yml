identifier: "CVE-2015-8968"
package_slug: "gem/git-fastclone"
title: "Arbitrary shell command execution from .gitmodules"
description: " Git allows executing arbitrary shell commands using `git-remote-ext`
  via remote\nURLs. Normally git never requests URLs that the user does not specifically
  request, so this is not a serious security concern. However, submodules did allow
  the remote repository to specify what URL to clone from. If an attacker can instruct
  a user to run a recursive clone from a repository they control, they can get a client
  to run an arbitrary shell command. Alternately, if an attacker can MITM an unencrypted
  git clone, they could exploit this. The ext command will be run if the repository
  is recursively cloned or if submodules are updated. This attack works when cloning
  both local and remote repositories."
