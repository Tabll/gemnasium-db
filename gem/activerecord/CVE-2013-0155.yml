identifier: "CVE-2013-0155"
package_slug: "gem/activerecord"
title: "Unsafe Query Generation Risk in Ruby on Rails"
description: "Due to the way Active Record interprets parameters in combination with
  the way that JSON parameters are parsed, it is possible for an attacker to issue
  unexpected database queries with \"IS NULL\" or empty where clauses. This issue
  does *not* let an attacker insert arbitrary values into an SQL query, however they
  can cause the query to check for NULL or eliminate a WHERE clause when most users
  wouldn't expect it."
