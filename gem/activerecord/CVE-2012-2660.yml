title: "SQL Injection"
description: "Ruby on Rails contains a flaw related to the way ActiveRecord handles
  parameters in conjunction with the way Rack parses query parameters. This issue
  may allow an attacker to inject arbitrary `IS NULL` clauses in to application SQL
  queries. This may also allow an attacker to have the SQL query check for `NULL`
  in arbitrary places."
