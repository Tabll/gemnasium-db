identifier: "CVE-2015-7577"
package_slug: "gem/activerecord"
title: "Nested attributes rejection proc bypass"
description: "When using the nested attributes feature in Active Record you can prevent
  the destruction of associated records by passing the `allow_destroy: false` option
  to the `accepts_nested_attributes_for` method. The `allow_destroy` flag prevents
  the `:reject_if` proc from being called because it assumes that the record will
  be destroyed anyway. However, this is not true if `:allow_destroy` is false so this
  leads to changes that would have been rejected being applied to the record. Attackers
  could set attributes to invalid values or clear all the attributes."
