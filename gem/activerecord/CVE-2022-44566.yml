description: "A denial of service vulnerability present in ActiveRecord's PostgreSQL
  adapter <7.0.4.1 and <6.1.7.1. When a value outside the range for a 64bit signed
  integer is provided to the PostgreSQL connection adapter, it will treat the target
  column type as numeric. Comparing integer values against numeric values can result
  in a slow sequential scan resulting in potential Denial of Service."
