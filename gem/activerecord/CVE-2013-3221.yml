title: "Active Record component in Ruby on Rails has a data-type injection vulnerability"
description: "The Active Record component in Ruby on Rails 2.3.x, 3.0.x, 3.1.x, and
  3.2.x does not ensure that the declared data type of a database column is used during
  comparisons of input values to stored values in that column, which makes it easier
  for remote attackers to conduct data-type injection attacks against Ruby on Rails
  applications via a crafted value, as demonstrated by unintended interaction between
  the \"typed XML\" feature and a MySQL database."
