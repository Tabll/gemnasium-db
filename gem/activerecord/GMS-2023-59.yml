description: "There is a potential denial of service vulnerability present in ActiveRecordâ€™s
  PostgreSQL adapter. In ActiveRecord <7.0.4.1 and <6.1.7.1, when a value outside
  the range for a 64bit signed integer is provided to the PostgreSQL connection adapter,
  it will treat the target column type as numeric. Comparing integer values against
  numeric values can result in a slow sequential scan resulting in potential Denial
  of Service."
