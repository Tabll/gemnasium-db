package_slug: "gem/activerecord"
title: "SQL Injection Vulnerabilities Affecting PostgreSQL"
description: "PostgreSQL adapter only. A bug in the SQL quoting code in ActiveRecord
  can allow an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL using carefully crafted values. Only
  applications which query against either bitstring or range types are vulnerable.
  Depending on the version of Rails you're using, the vulnerable code will take either
  take the form of: ``` Model.where(bitstring: params[:some_value]) Model.where(range:
  params[:from]..params[:to]) ``` The only feasible workaround for this issue is to
  not allow user controlled values to be used in queries with the affected data types.
  Upgrading is strongly advised."
