package_slug: "gem/protocol-http1"
title: "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')"
description: "protocol-http1 provides a low-level implementation of the HTTP/1 protocol.
  RFC 9112 Section 7.1 defined the format of chunk size, chunk data and chunk extension.
  The value of Content-Length header should be a string of 0-9 digits, the chunk size
  should be a string of hex digits and should split from chunk data using CRLF, and
  the chunk extension shouldn't contain any invisible character. However, Falcon has
  following behaviors while disobey the corresponding RFCs: accepting Content-Length
  header values that have `+` prefix, accepting Content-Length header values that
  written in hexadecimal with `0x` prefix, accepting `0x` and `+` prefixed chunk size,
  and accepting LF in chunk extension. This behavior can lead to desync when forwarding
  through multiple HTTP parsers, potentially results in HTTP request smuggling and
  firewall bypassing. This issue is fixed in `protocol-http1` v0.15.1. There are no
  known workarounds."
