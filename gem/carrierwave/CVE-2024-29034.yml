description: "The vulnerability [CVE-2023-49090](https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/security/advisories/GHSA-gxhx-g4fq-49hj)
  wasn't fully addressed.\n\nThis vulnerability is caused by the fact that when uploading
  to object storage, including Amazon S3, it is possible to set a Content-Type value
  that is interpreted by browsers to be different from what's allowed by `content_type_allowlist`,
  by providing multiple values separated by commas.\n\nThis bypassed value can be
  used to cause XSS."
