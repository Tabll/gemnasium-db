package_slug: "gem/carrierwave"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "CarrierWave is a solution for file uploads for Rails, Sinatra and other
  Ruby web frameworks. CarrierWave has a Content-Type allowlist bypass vulnerability,
  possibly leading to XSS. The validation in `allowlisted_content_type?` determines
  Content-Type permissions by performing a partial match. If the `content_type` argument
  of `allowlisted_content_type?` is passed a value crafted by the attacker, Content-Types
  not included in the `content_type_allowlist` will be allowed. This issue has been
  patched in versions 2.2.5 and 3.0.5."
