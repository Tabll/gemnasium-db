identifier: "CVE-2019-25025"
package_slug: "gem/activerecord-session_store"
title: "Observable Timing Discrepancy"
description: "The activerecord-session_store (aka Active Record Session Store) component
  for Ruby on Rails does not use a constant-time approach when delivering information
  about whether a guessed session ID is valid. Consequently, remote attackers can
  leverage timing discrepancies to achieve a correct guess in a relatively short amount
  of time. This is a related issue to CVE-2019-16782."
