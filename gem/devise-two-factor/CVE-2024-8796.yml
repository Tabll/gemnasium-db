package_slug: "gem/devise-two-factor"
title: "Devise-Two-Factor Authentication Uses Insufficient Default OTP Shared Secret
  Length"
description: "Under the default configuration, Devise-Two-Factor versions >= 2.2.0
  & < 6.0.0 generate TOTP shared secrets that are 120 bits instead of the 128-bit
  minimum defined by [RFC 4226](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4226). Using
  a shared secret shorter than the minimum to generate a multi-factor authentication
  code could make it easier for an attacker to guess the shared secret and generate
  valid TOTP codes."
