title: "Man-in-the-Middle"
description: "This package is vulnerable to Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks due to
  attacks due to downloading gems over an insecure protocol. Without a secure connection,
  it is possible for an attacker to intercept this connection and alter the packages

  your host server."
