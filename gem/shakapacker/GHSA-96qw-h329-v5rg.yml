title: "Shakapacker has environment variable leak via EnvironmentPlugin that exposes
  secrets to client-side bundles"
description: "Since 2017, the default webpack plugins have passed the entire `process.env`
  to `EnvironmentPlugin`. This pattern exposed ALL build environment variables to
  client-side JavaScript bundles whenever application code (or any dependency) referenced
  `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME`.\n\nThis is not a regression - the vulnerable code has
  existed since the original Webpacker implementation. No recent code change in Shakapacker
  triggered this issue."
