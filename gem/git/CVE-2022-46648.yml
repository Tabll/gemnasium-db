package_slug: "gem/git"
title: "ruby-git has potential remote code execution vulnerability"
description: "The git gem, between versions 1.2.0 and 1.12.0, incorrectly parsed the
  output of the `git ls-files` command using `eval()` to unescape quoted file names.
  If a file name was added to the git repository contained special characters, such
  as `\\n`, then the `git ls-files` command would print the file name in quotes and
  escape any special characters. If the `Git#ls_files` method encountered a quoted
  file name it would use `eval()` to unquote and unescape any special characters,
  leading to potential remote code execution. Version 1.13.0 of the git gem was released
  which correctly parses any quoted file names."
