title: "Nokogiri does not check the return value from xmlC14NExecute"
description: "Nokogiri's CRuby extension fails to check the return value from `xmlC14NExecute`
  in the method `Nokogiri::XML::Document#canonicalize` and `Nokogiri::XML::Node#canonicalize`.
  When canonicalization fails, an empty string is returned instead of raising an exception.
  This incorrect return value may allow downstream libraries to accept invalid or
  incomplete canonicalized XML, which has been demonstrated to enable signature validation
  bypass in SAML libraries.\n\nJRuby is not affected, as the Java implementation correctly
  raises `RuntimeError` on canonicalization failure."
