title: "Heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in libxml2"
description: "Heap-based buffer overflow in the xmlGROW function in `parser.c` in
  libxml2 allows context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive process memory information
  via unspecified vectors. It was discovered that libxml2 incorrectly handled certain
  malformed documents. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially
  crafted document, an attacker could possibly cause libxml2 to crash, resulting in
  a denial of service."
