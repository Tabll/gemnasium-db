package_slug: "gem/nokogiri"
title: "Unchecked Return Value"
description: "Nokogiri is an open source XML and HTML library for the Ruby programming
  language. Nokogiri `1.13.8` and `1.13.9` fail to check the return value from `xmlTextReaderExpand`
  in the method `Nokogiri::XML::Reader#attribute_hash`. This can lead to a null pointer
  exception when invalid markup is being parsed. For applications using `XML::Reader`
  to parse untrusted inputs, this may potentially be a vector for a denial of service
  attack. Users are advised to upgrade to Nokogiri `>= 1.13.10`. Users may be able
  to search their code for calls to either `XML::Reader#attributes` or `XML::Reader#attribute_hash`
  to determine if they are affected."
