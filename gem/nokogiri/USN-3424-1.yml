  Nokogiri has mitigated these issues by upgrading to libxml It was discovered that
  a type confusion error existed in libxml2. An attacker could use this to specially
  construct XML data that could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary
  code. (CVE-2017-0663) It was discovered that libxml2 did not properly validate parsed
  entity references. An attacker could use this to specially construct XML data that
  could expose sensitive information. (CVE-2017-7375) It was discovered that a buffer
  overflow existed in libxml2 when handling HTTP redirects. An attacker could use
  this to specially construct XML data that could cause a denial of service or possibly
  execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-7376) Marcel Böhme and Van-Thuan Pham discovered
  a buffer overflow in libxml2 when handling elements. An attacker could use this
  to specially construct XML data that could cause a denial of service or possibly
  execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-9047) Marcel Böhme and Van-Thuan Pham discovered
  a buffer overread in libxml2 when handling elements. An attacker could use this
  to specially construct XML data that could cause a denial of service. (CVE-2017-9048)
  Marcel Böhme and Van-Thuan Pham discovered multiple buffer overreads in libxml2
  when handling parameter-entity references. An attacker could use these to specially
  construct XML data that could cause a denial of service. (CVE-2017-9049, CVE-2017-9050)"
