title: "Nokogiri update packaged libxml2 to v2.12.5 to resolve CVE-2024-25062"
description: "## Summary\n\nNokogiri v1.16.2 upgrades the version of its dependency
  libxml2 to [v2.12.5](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/releases/v2.12.5).\n\nlibxml2
  v2.12.5 addresses the following vulnerability:\n\n- CVE-2024-25062 / https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-25062\n
  - described at https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/issues/604\n - patched by
  https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/commit/92721970\n\nPlease note that this
  advisory only applies to the CRuby implementation of Nokogiri `< 1.16.2`, and only
  if the _packaged_ libraries are being used. If you've overridden defaults at installation
  time to use _system_ libraries instead of packaged libraries, you should instead
  pay attention to your distro's `libxml2` release announcements.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nUpgrade
  to Nokogiri `>= 1.16.2`.\n\nUsers who are unable to upgrade Nokogiri may also choose
  a more complicated mitigation: compile and link Nokogiri against external libraries
  libxml2 `>= 2.12.5` which will also address these same issues.\n\n## Impact\n\nFrom
  the CVE description, this issue applies to the `xmlTextReader` module (which underlies
  `Nokogiri::XML::Reader`):\n\n> When using the XML Reader interface with DTD validation
  and XInclude expansion enabled, processing crafted XML documents can lead to an
  xmlValidatePopElement use-after-free.\n\n## Timeline\n\n- 2024-02-04 10:35 EST -
