title: "Integer Overflow or Wraparound in libxml2 affects Nokogiri"
description: "### Summary\n\nNokogiri v1.13.5 upgrades the packaged version of its
  dependency libxml2 from v2.9.13 to [v2.9.14](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/releases/v2.9.14).\n\nlibxml2
  v2.9.14 addresses [CVE-2022-29824](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29824).
  This version also includes several security-related bug fixes for which CVEs were
  not created, including a potential double-free, potential memory leaks, and integer-overflow.\n\nPlease
  note that this advisory only applies to the CRuby implementation of Nokogiri `<
  1.13.5`, and only if the _packaged_ libraries are being used. If you've overridden
  defaults at installation time to use _system_ libraries instead of packaged libraries,
  you should instead pay attention to your distro's `libxml2` and `libxslt` release
  announcements.\n\n\n### Mitigation\n\nUpgrade to Nokogiri `>= 1.13.5`.\n\nUsers
  who are unable to upgrade Nokogiri may also choose a more complicated mitigation:
  compile and link Nokogiri against external libraries libxml2 `>= 2.9.14` which will
  also address these same issues.\n\n\n### Impact\n\n#### libxml2 [CVE-2022-29824](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29824)\n\n-
  **CVSS3 score**:\n - Unspecified upstream\n - Nokogiri maintainers evaluate at 8.6
  (High) ([.\n- **Type**: Denial of service, information disclosure\n- **Description**:
  In libxml2 before 2.9.14, several buffer handling functions in buf.c (xmlBuf*) and
  tree.c (xmlBuffer*) don't check for integer overflows. This can result in out-of-bounds
  memory writes. Exploitation requires a victim to open a crafted, multi-gigabyte
  XML file. Other software using libxml2's buffer functions, for example libxslt through
  1.1.35, is affected as well.\n- **Fixed**: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/commit/2554a24\n\nAll
  versions of libml2 prior to v2.9.14 are affected.\n\nApplications parsing or serializing
  multi-gigabyte documents (in excess of INT_MAX bytes) may be vulnerable to an integer
  overflow bug in buffer handling that could lead to exposure of confidential data,
  modification of unrelated data, or a segmentation fault resulting in a denial-of-service.\n\n\n###
