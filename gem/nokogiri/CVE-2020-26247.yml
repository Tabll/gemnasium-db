package_slug: "gem/nokogiri"
title: "Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference"
description: "Nokogiri is a Rubygem providing HTML, XML, SAX, and Reader parsers with
  XPath and CSS selector support. XML Schemas parsed by `Nokogiri::XML::Schema` are
  trusted by default, allowing external resources to be accessed over the network,
  potentially enabling XXE or SSRF attacks. This behavior is counter to the security
  policy followed by Nokogiri maintainers, which is to treat all input as untrusted
  by default whenever possible."
