package_slug: "gem/nokogiri"
title: "Improper Handling of Unexpected Data Type"
description: "Nokogiri is an open source XML and HTML library for Ruby. Nokogiri prior
  to version 1.13.6 does not type-check all inputs into the XML and HTML4 SAX parsers,
  allowing specially crafted untrusted inputs to cause illegal memory access errors
  (segfault) or reads from unrelated memory. Version 1.13.6 contains a patch for this
  issue. As a workaround, ensure the untrusted input is a `String` by calling `#to_s`
  or equivalent."
