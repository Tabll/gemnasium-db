identifier: "CVE-2012-6684"
package_slug: "gem/RedCloth"
title: "Textile Link Parsing XSS"
description: "RedCloth Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that allows a cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attack. This flaw exists because the program does not validate input when
  parsing textile links before returning it to users. This may allow a remote attacker
  to create a specially crafted request that would execute arbitrary script code in
  a user's browser session within the trust relationship between their browser and
  the server."
