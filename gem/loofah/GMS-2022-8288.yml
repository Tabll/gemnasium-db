title: "Duplicate of ./gem/loofah/CVE-2022-23516.yml"
description: "## Summary\n\nLoofah `>= 2.2.0, < 2.19.1` uses recursion for sanitizing
  `CDATA` sections, making it susceptible to stack exhaustion and raising a `SystemStackError`
  exception. This may lead to a denial of service through CPU resource consumption.\n\n\n##
  Mitigation\n\nUpgrade to Loofah `>= 2.19.1`.\n\nUsers who are unable to upgrade
  may be able to mitigate this vulnerability by limiting the length of the strings
  that are sanitized.\n\n\n## Severity\n\nThe Loofah maintainers have evaluated this
  as [High Severity 7.5 (CVSS3.1)](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#.\n\n\n##
  References\n\n- [CWE - CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion (4.9)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/674.html)\n"
