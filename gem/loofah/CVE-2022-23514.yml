title: "Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity"
description: "Loofah is a general library for manipulating and transforming HTML/XML
  documents and fragments, built on top of Nokogiri. Loofah < 2.19.1 contains an inefficient
  regular expression that is susceptible to excessive backtracking when attempting

  CPU resource consumption. This issue is patched in version 2.19.1."
