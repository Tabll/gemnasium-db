package_slug: "gem/loofah"
title: "Uncontrolled Recursion"
description: "Loofah is a general library for manipulating and transforming HTML/XML
  documents and fragments, built on top of Nokogiri. Loofah >= 2.2.0, < 2.19.1 uses
  recursion for sanitizing CDATA sections, making it susceptible to stack exhaustion
  and raising a SystemStackError exception. This may lead to a denial of service through
  CPU resource consumption. This issue is patched in version 2.19.1. Users who are
  unable to upgrade may be able to mitigate this vulnerability by limiting the length
  of the strings that are sanitized."
