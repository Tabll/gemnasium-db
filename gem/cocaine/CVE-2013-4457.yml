package_slug: "gem/cocaine"
title: "Recursive Interpolation Vulnerability"
description: "Due to the method of variable interpolation in Cocaine to, an attacker
  may be able to inject hostile commands into a command line via a crafted hash object
  which are not properly escaped. The impact is lessened on Ruby * because hashed
  are not ordered by default, and so an attacker must rely on luck for the attack
  to work. An attack of this sort cannot take place if there is only one value being
  interpolated into the command line. Users of the Paperclip gem are encouraged to
  upgrade to the latest version of Cocaine. Users of the branch of Paperclip will
  not need to upgrade as the version of Cocaine it uses is not vulnerable to this
  attack."
