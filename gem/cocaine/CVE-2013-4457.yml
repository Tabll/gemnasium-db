identifier: "CVE-2013-4457"
package_slug: "gem/cocaine"
title: "Recursive Interpolation Vulnerability"
description: "Due to the method of variable interpolation in Cocaine 0.4.0 to 0.5.2,
  an attacker may be able to inject hostile commands into a command line via a crafted
  hash object which are not properly escaped. The impact is lessened on Ruby version
  1.8.* because hashed are not ordered by default, and so an attacker must rely on
  luck for the attack to work. An attack of this sort cannot take place if there is
  only one value being interpolated into the command line. Users of the Paperclip
  gem are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version of Cocaine. Users of the 2.7
  branch of Paperclip will not need to upgrade as the version of Cocaine it uses is
  not vulnerable to this attack."
