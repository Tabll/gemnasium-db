package_slug: "gem/avo"
title: "Use of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code ('Unsafe Reflection')"
description: "Avo is an open source ruby on rails admin panel creation framework.
  The polymorphic field type stores the classes to operate on when updating a record
  with user input, and does not validate them in the back end. This can lead to unexpected
  behavior, remote code execution, or application crashes when viewing a manipulated
  record. This issue has been addressed in commit `ec117882d` which is expected to
  be included in subsequent releases. Users are advised to limit access to untrusted
  users until a new release is made."
