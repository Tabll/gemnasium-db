identifier: "CVE-2018-1000088"
package_slug: "gem/doorkeeper"
title: "XSS on authorization consent view"
description: "Stored XSS on the OAuth Client's name will cause users being prompted
  for consent via the `implicit` grant type to execute the XSS payload. The XSS attack
  could gain access to the user's active session, resulting in account compromise.
  Any user is susceptible if they click the authorization link for the malicious OAuth
  client. Because of how the links work, a user cannot tell if a link is malicious
  or not without first visiting the page with the XSS payload. In addition, there
  is stored XSS in the `native_redirect_uri` form element."
