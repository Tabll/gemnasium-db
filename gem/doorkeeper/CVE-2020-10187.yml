package_slug: "gem/doorkeeper"
title: "Information Exposure"
description: "Doorkeeper contains an information disclosure vulnerability that allows
  an attacker to retrieve the client secret only intended for the OAuth application
  owner. After authorizing the application and allowing access, the attacker simply
  needs to request the list of their authorized applications in a JSON format (usually
  GET `/oauth/authorized_applications.json`). An application is vulnerable if the
  authorized application controller is enabled."
