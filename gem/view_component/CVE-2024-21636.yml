package_slug: "gem/view_component"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "view_component is a framework for building reusable, testable, and encapsulated
  view components in Ruby on Rails. Versions prior to 3.9.0 have a cross-site scripting
  vulnerability that has the potential to impact anyone rendering a component directly
  from a controller with the view_component gem. Note that only components that define
  a `#call` method (i.e. instead of using a sidecar template) are affected. The return
  value of the `#call` method is not sanitized and can include user-defined content.
  In addition, the return value of the `#output_postamble` methodis not sanitized,
  which can also lead to cross-site scripting issues. Versions 3.9.0 has been released
  and fully mitigates both the `#call` and the `#output_postamble` vulnerabilities.
  As a workaround, sanitize the return value of `#call`."
