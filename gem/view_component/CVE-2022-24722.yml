package_slug: "gem/view_component"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "VIewComponent is a framework for building view components in Ruby on
  Rails. Versions prior to 2.31.2 and 2.49.1 contain a cross-site scripting vulnerability
  that has the potential to impact anyone using translations with the view_component
  gem. Data received via user input and passed as an interpolation argument to the
  `translate` method is not properly sanitized before display. Versions 2.31.2 and
  2.49.1 have been released and fully mitigate the vulnerability. As a workaround,
  avoid passing user input to the `translate` function, or sanitize the inputs before
  passing them."
