package_slug: "gem/field_test"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "The `field_test` gem for Ruby has unvalidated input. A method call that
  is expected to return a value from a certain set of inputs can be made to return
  any input, which can be dangerous depending on how applications use it. If an application
  treats arbitrary variants as trusted, this can lead to a variety of potential vulnerabilities
  like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS)."
