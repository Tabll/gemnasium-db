identifier: "CVE-2014-9489"
package_slug: "gem/gollum-grit_adapter"
title: "Remote Code Execution"
description: "In vulnerable versions of the gem, searching for the string `-O<arbitrary
  command>` or `--open-files-in-pager <arbritary command>` in the wiki's search field
  will execute an arbitrary shell command. However, this will only work if the string
  \"master\" (or more precisely, the name of the git branch that gollum is using)
  is found in one of the wiki's files: \"master\" is then interpreted as the search
  query, `-O<arbitary code>` as a command line option to `git grep`."
