title: "Heap-based Buffer Overflow"
description: "yajl-ruby is a C binding to the YAJL JSON parsing and generation library.
  The 1.x branch and the 2.x branch of `yajl` contain an integer overflow which leads
  to subsequent heap memory corruption when dealing with large (~2GB) inputs. The
  reallocation logic at `yajl_buf.c#L64` may result in the `need` 32bit integer wrapping
  to 0 when `need` approaches a value of 0x80000000 (i.e. ~2GB of data), which results
  in a reallocation of buf->alloc into a small heap chunk. These integers are declared
  as `size_t` in the 2.x branch of `yajl`, which practically prevents the issue from
  triggering on 64bit platforms, however this does not preclude this issue triggering
  on 32bit builds on which `size_t` is a 32bit integer. Subsequent population of this
  under-allocated heap chunk is based on the original buffer size, leading to heap
  memory corruption. This vulnerability mostly impacts process availability. Maintainers
  believe exploitation for arbitrary code execution is unlikely. A patch is available
  and anticipated to be part of yajl-ruby version 1.4.2. As a workaround, avoid passing
  large inputs to YAJL."
