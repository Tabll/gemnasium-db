identifier: "CVE-2013-6416"
package_slug: "gem/actionpack"
title: "XSS Vulnerability in simple_format helper"
description: "The simple_format helper converts user supplied text into html text
  which is intended to be safe for display. A change made to the implementation of
  this helper means that any user provided HTML attributes will not be escaped correctly.
  As a result of this error, applications which pass user-controlled data to be included
  as html attributes will be vulnerable to an XSS attack. "
