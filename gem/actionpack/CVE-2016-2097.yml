package_slug: "gem/actionpack"
title: "Possible Information Leak Vulnerability in ActionView"
description: "Applications that pass unverified user input to the `render` method
  in a controller may be vulnerable to an information leak vulnerability. Impacted
  code will look something like this: `def index; render params[:id]; end`. Carefully
  crafted requests can cause the above code to render files from unexpected places
  like outside the application's view directory, and can possibly escalate this to
  a remote code execution attack."
