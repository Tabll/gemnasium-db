title: "Possible Content Security Policy bypass in Action Dispatch"
description: "There is a possible Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability  in the
  `content_security_policy` helper in Action Pack.\n\nImpact\n------\nApplications
  which set Content-Security-Policy (CSP) headers dynamically from untrusted user
  input may be vulnerable to carefully crafted inputs being able to inject new directives
  into the CSP. This could lead to a bypass of the CSP and its protection against
  XSS and other attacks.\n\nReleases\n--------\nThe fixed releases are available at
  the normal locations.\n\nWorkarounds\n-----------\nApplications can avoid setting
  CSP headers dynamically from untrusted input, or can validate/sanitize that input.\n\nCredits\n-------\nThanks
  to [ryotak](https://hackerone.com/ryotak) for the report!"
