package_slug: "gem/actionpack"
title: "Timing attack vulnerability in basic authentication"
description: "Due to the way that Action Controller compares user names and passwords
  in basic authentication authorization code, it is possible for an attacker to analyze
  the time taken by a response and intuit the password. You can tell you application
  is vulnerable to this attack by looking for `http_basic_authenticate_with` method
  calls in your application. "
