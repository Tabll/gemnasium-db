title: "Open Redirect Vulnerability in Action Pack"
description: "This is a duplicate of /gem/actionpack/CVE-2023-22797.yml. 
  There is a vulnerability in Action Controllerâ€™s `redirect_to`. There is a possible open 
  redirect when using the redirect_to helper with untrusted user input. Vulnerable code will look 
  like this: `redirect_to(params[:some_param])`. Rails 7.0 introduced protection against open 
  redirects from calling `redirect_to` with untrusted user input. In prior versions the developer 
  was fully responsible for only providing trusted input. However the check introduced could 
  be bypassed by a carefully crafted URL."
