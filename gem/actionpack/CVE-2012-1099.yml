identifier: "CVE-2012-1099"
package_slug: "gem/actionpack"
title: "XSS via posted select tag options"
description: "Ruby on Rails is vulnerable to remote cross-site scripting because the
  application does not validate manually generated `select tag options` upon submission
  to `actionpack/lib/action_view/helpers/form_options_helper.rb`. This may allow a
  user to create a specially crafted request that would execute arbitrary script code
  in a user's browser within the trust relationship between their browser and the
  server. "
