title: "Action Pack contains database-query restrictions bypass"
description: "`actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/http/request.rb` in Ruby on Rails before
  2.3.16, 3.0.x before 3.0.13, 3.1.x before 3.1.5, and 3.2.x before 3.2.4 does not
  properly consider differences in parameter handling between the Active Record component
  and the Rack interface, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended database-query
  restrictions and perform NULL checks via a crafted request, as demonstrated by certain
  `[nil]` values, a related issue to CVE-2012-2694."
