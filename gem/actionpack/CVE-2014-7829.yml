identifier: "CVE-2014-7829"
package_slug: "gem/actionpack"
title: "Arbitrary file existence disclosure"
description: "Specially crafted requests can be used to determine whether a file exists
  on the filesystem that is outside the Rails application's root directory. The files
  will not be served, but attackers can determine whether the file exists. This only
  impacts Rails applications that enable static file serving at runtime. For example,
  the application's production configuration will say: `config.serve_static_assets
  = true`"
