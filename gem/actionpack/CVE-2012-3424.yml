title: "actionpack Improper Authentication vulnerability"
description: "The `decode_credentials` method in `actionpack/lib/action_controller/metal/http_authentication.rb`
  in Ruby on Rails before 3.0.16, 3.1.x before 3.1.7, and 3.2.x before 3.2.7 converts
  Digest Authentication strings to symbols, which allows remote attackers to cause
  a denial of service by leveraging access to an application that uses a `with_http_digest`
  helper method, as demonstrated by the `authenticate_or_request_with_http_digest`
  method."
