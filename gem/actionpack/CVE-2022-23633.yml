package_slug: "gem/actionpack"
title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "Action Pack is a framework for handling and responding to web requests.
  Under certain circumstances response bodies will not be closed. In the event a response
  is *not* notified of a `close`, `ActionDispatch::Executor` will not know to reset
  thread local state for the next request. This can lead to data being leaked to subsequent
  requests.This has been fixed in Rails 7.0.2.1, 6.1.4.5, 6.0.4.5, and 5.2.6.1. Upgrading
  is highly recommended, but to work around this problem a middleware described in
  GHSA-wh98-p28r-vrc9 can be used."
