title: "ReDoS based DoS vulnerability in Action Dispatch"
description: "There is a possible regular expression based DoS vulnerability in Action
  Dispatch related to the If-None-Match header. This vulnerability has been assigned
  the CVE identifier CVE-2023-22795. A specially crafted HTTP `If-None-Match` header
  can cause the regular expression engine to enter a state of catastrophic backtracking,
  when on a version of Ruby below 3.2.0. This can cause the process to use large amounts
  of CPU and memory, leading to a possible DoS vulnerability All users running an
  affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately."
