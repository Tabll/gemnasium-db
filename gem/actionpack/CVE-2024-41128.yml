title: "Possible ReDoS vulnerability in query parameter filtering in Action Dispatch"
description: "There is a possible ReDoS vulnerability in the query parameter filtering
  routines of Action Dispatch. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier
  CVE-2024-41128.\n\nImpact\n------\n\nCarefully crafted query parameters can cause
  query parameter filtering to take an unexpected amount of time, possibly resulting
  in a DoS vulnerability. All users running an affected release should either upgrade
  or apply the relevant patch immediately.\n\nRuby 3.2 has mitigations for this problem,
  so Rails applications using Ruby 3.2 or newer are unaffected. Rails 8.0.0.beta1
  depends on Ruby 3.2 or greater so is unaffected.\n\n\nReleases\n--------\nThe fixed
  releases are available at the normal locations.\n\nWorkarounds\n-----------\nUsers
  on Ruby 3.2 are unaffected by this issue.\n\n\nCredits\n-------\n\nThanks to [scyoon](https://hackerone.com/scyoon)
  for the report and patches!"
