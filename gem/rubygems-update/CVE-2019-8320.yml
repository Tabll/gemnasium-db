identifier: "CVE-2019-8320"
package_slug: "gem/rubygems-update"
title: "Path Traversal"
description: "A Directory Traversal issue was discovered in RubyGems. Before making
  new directories or touching files (which now include path-checking code for symlinks),
  it would delete the target destination. If that destination was hidden behind a
  symlink, a malicious gem could delete arbitrary files on the user's machine, presuming
  the attacker could guess at paths. Given how frequently gem is run as sudo, and
  how predictable paths are on modern systems (`/tmp`, `/usr`, etc.), this could likely
  lead to data loss or an unusable system."
