title: "NULL Pointer Dereference"
description: "It was discovered that the C++ implementation (which underlies the R,
  Python and Ruby implementations) of Apache Arrow has an uninitialized memory bug
  when building arrays with `null` values in some cases. This can lead to uninitialized
  memory being unintentionally shared if Arrow Arrays are transmitted over the wire
  (for instance with Flight) or persisted in the streaming IPC and file formats."
