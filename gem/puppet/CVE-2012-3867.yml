description: "lib/puppet/ssl/certificate_authority.rb in Puppet before 2.6.17 and
  2.7.x before 2.7.18, and Puppet Enterprise before 2.5.2, does not properly restrict
  the characters in the Common Name field of a Certificate Signing Request (CSR),
  which makes it easier for user-assisted remote attackers to trick administrators
  into signing a crafted agent certificate via ANSI control sequences."
