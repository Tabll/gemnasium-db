identifier: "CVE-2020-7942"
package_slug: "gem/puppet"
title: "Improper Certificate Validation"
description: "Previously, Puppet operated on a model that a node with a valid certificate
  was entitled to all information in the system and that a compromised certificate
  allowed access to everything in the infrastructure. When a node's catalog falls
  back to the `default` node, the catalog can be retrieved for a different node by
  modifying facts for the Puppet run. This issue can be mitigated by setting `strict_hostname_checking
  = true` in `puppet.conf` on your Puppet master. Puppet changes the default behavior
  for strict_hostname_checking from false to true."
