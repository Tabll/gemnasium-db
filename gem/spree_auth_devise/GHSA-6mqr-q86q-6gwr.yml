title: "Duplicate Advisory: Authentication Bypass by CSRF Weakness"
description: "CSRF vulnerability that allows user account takeover.\n\nAll applications
  using any version of the frontend component of `spree_auth_devise` are affected
  if `protect_from_forgery` method is both:\n\n* Executed whether as:\n* A before_action
  callback (the default)\n* A prepend_before_action (option prepend: true given) before
  the :load_object hook in Spree::UserController (most likely order to find).\n* Configured
  to use :null_session or :reset_session strategies (:null_session is the default
  in case the no strategy is given, but rails --new generated skeleton use :exception).\n\nThat
  means that applications that haven't been configured differently from what it's
  generated with Rails aren't affected.\n\nThanks @waiting-for-dev for reporting and
  providing a patch 👏"
