package_slug: "gem/google-protobuf"
title: "Denial of Service"
description: "An issue in protobuf-java (JRuby gem) allowed the interleaving of `com.google.protobuf.UnknownFieldSet`
  fields in such a way that would be processed out of order. A small malicious payload
  can occupy the parser for several minutes by creating large numbers of short-lived
  objects that cause frequent, repeated pauses. We recommend upgrading libraries beyond
  the vulnerable versions."
