package_slug: "gem/google-protobuf"
title: "Denial of Service"
description: "An issue in protobuf-java (JRuby gem) allowed the interleaving of 
  `com.google.protobuf.UnknownFieldSet` fields in such a way that would be processed 
  out of order. A small malicious payload can occupy the parser for several minutes 
  by creating large numbers of short-lived objects that cause frequent, repeated 
  pauses. We recommend upgrading libraries beyond the vulnerable versions."
