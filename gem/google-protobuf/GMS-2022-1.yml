description: "## Summary\n\nA potential Denial of Service issue in protobuf-java was
  discovered in the parsing procedure for binary data.\n\nReporter: [OSS-Fuzz](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz)\n\nAffected
  versions: All versions of Java Protobufs (including Kotlin and JRuby) prior to the
  versions listed below. Protobuf \"javalite\" users (typically Android) are not affected.\n\n##
  Severity\n\n[CVE-2021-22569](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-22569)
  **High** - CVSS Score:, An implementation weakness in how unknown fields are parsed
  in Java. A small (~800 KB) malicious payload can occupy the parser for several minutes
  by creating large numbers of short-lived objects that cause frequent, repeated GC
  pauses.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nFor reproduction details, please refer to the
  oss-fuzz issue that identifies the specific inputs that exercise this parsing weakness.\n\n##
  Remediation and Mitigation\n\nPlease update to the latest available versions of
  the following packages:\n\n- protobuf-java (3.16.1 ) \n- protobuf-kotlin (3.18.2
  )\n- google-protobuf [JRuby gem only] (3.19.2) \n"
