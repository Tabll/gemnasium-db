package_slug: "gem/arr-pm"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command
  Injection')"
description: "Arr-pm is an RPM reader/writer library written in Ruby. Versions prior
  to 0.0.12 are subject to OS command injection resulting in shell execution if the
  RPM contains a malicious \"payload compressor\" field. This vulnerability impacts
  the `extract` and `files` methods of the `RPM::File` class of this library. Version
  0.0.12 patches these issues. A workaround for this issue is to ensure any RPMs being
  processed contain valid/known payload compressor values such as gzip, bzip2, xz,
  zstd, and lzma. The payload compressor field in an rpm can be checked by using the
  rpm command line tool. "
