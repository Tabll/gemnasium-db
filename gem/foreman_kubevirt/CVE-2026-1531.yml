title: "foreman_kubevirt disables SSL verification if a Certificate Authority (CA)
  certificate is not explicitly set"
description: "A flaw was found in foreman_kubevirt. When configuring the connection
  to OpenShift, the system disables SSL verification if a Certificate Authority (CA)
  certificate is not explicitly set. This insecure default allows a remote attacker,
  capable of intercepting network traffic between Satellite and OpenShift, to perform
  a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack. Such an attack could lead to the disclosure or
  alteration of sensitive information."
