package_slug: "gem/update_by_case"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')"
description: "This Rails gem adds two methods to the ActiveRecord::Base class that
  allow you to update many records on a single database hit, using a case sql statement
  for it. Before version 0.1.3 `update_by_case` gem used custom sql strings, and it
  was not sanitized, making it vulnerable to sql injection. Upgrade to version >=
  0.1.3 that uses `Arel` instead to construct the resulting sql statement, with sanitized
  sql."
