identifier: "CVE-2020-5257"
package_slug: "gem/administrate"
title: "SQL Injection"
description: "In Administrate (rubygem), when sorting by attributes on a dashboard,
  the direction parameter was not validated before being interpolated into the SQL
  query. This could present a SQL injection if the attacker were able to modify the
  `direction` parameter and bypass ActiveRecord SQL protections. Whilst this does
  have a high-impact, to exploit this you need access to the Administrate dashboards,
  which we would expect to be behind authentication."
