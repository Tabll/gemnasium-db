identifier: "CVE-2018-20164"
package_slug: "gem/user_agent_parser"
title: "ReDoS"
description: "The programming library UA-Parser uses regular expressions to identify
  user agent strings. The complexity of the regular expressions is such that an attacker
  can craft special patterns that keep the server busy for a long time. By sending
  many requests in short order, an attacker can exhaust the amount of processing power
  available."
