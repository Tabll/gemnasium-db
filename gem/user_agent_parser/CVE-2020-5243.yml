description: "uap-core is vulnerable to a denial of service attack when processing
  crafted `User-Agent` strings. Some regexes are vulnerable to regular expression
  denial of service (REDoS) due to overlapping capture groups. This allows remote
  attackers to overload a server by setting the `User-Agent` header in an HTTP(S)
  request to maliciously crafted long strings. This has been patched in uap-core "
