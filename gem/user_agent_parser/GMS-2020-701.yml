title: "Denial of Service in uap-core when processing crafted User-Agent strings"
description: "### Impact\nSome regexes are vulnerable to regular expression denial
  of service (REDoS) due to overlapping capture groups. This allows remote attackers
  to overload a server by setting the User-Agent header in an HTTP(S) request to maliciously
  crafted long strings.\n\n### Patches\nPlease update `uap-ruby` to &gt;= v2.6.0\n\n###
  For more information\nhttps://github.com/ua-parser/uap-core/security/advisories/GHSA-cmcx-xhr8-3w9p\n\nReported
