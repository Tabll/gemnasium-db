title: "Missing normalization before request path processing"
description: "When using rack-attack with a RoR app, developers expect the request
  path to be normalized. In particular, trailing slashes are stripped so a request
  path `/login/` becomes `/login` by the time you're in `ActionController`. Since
  `Rack::Attack` runs before `ActionDispatch`, the request path is not yet normalized.
  This can cause throttles and denylists to not work as expected."
