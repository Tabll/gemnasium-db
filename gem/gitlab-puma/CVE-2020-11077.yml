identifier: "CVE-2020-11077"
package_slug: "gem/gitlab-puma"
title: "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests (HTTP Request Smuggling)"
description: "In GitLab Puma (RubyGem), a client could smuggle a request through a
  proxy, causing the proxy to send a response back to another unknown client. If the
  proxy uses persistent connections and the client adds another request in via HTTP
  pipelining, the proxy may mistake it as the first request's body. Puma, however,
  would see it as two requests, and when processing the second request, send back
  a response that the proxy does not expect. If the proxy has reused the persistent
  connection to Puma to send another request for a different client, the second response
  from the first client will be sent to the second client."
