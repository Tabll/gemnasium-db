identifier: "CVE-2021-29509"
package_slug: "gem/gitlab-puma"
title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "Puma is a concurrent HTTP 1.1 server for Ruby/Rack applications. The 
  fix for CVE-2019-16770 was incomplete. The original fix only protected existing 
  connections that had already been accepted from having their requests starved by
  greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in the same process. However, 
  new connections may still be starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating 
  all threads in all processes in the cluster. A `puma` server which received more 
  concurrent `keep-alive` connections than the server had threads in its threadpool
  would service only a subset of connections, denying service to the unserved 
  connections."
