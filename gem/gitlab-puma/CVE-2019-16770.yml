title: "Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling"
description: "In GitLab Puma, a poorly-behaved client could use keepalive requests
  to monopolize Puma's reactor and create a denial of service attack. If more keepalive
  connections to Puma are opened than there are threads available, additional connections
  will wait permanently if the attacker sends requests frequently enough."
