title: "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests (HTTP Request Smuggling)"
description: "agoo allows request smuggling attacks where agoo is used as a backend
  with a frontend proxy that is also vulnerable. It is possible to conduct HTTP request
  smuggling attacks by sending the `Content-Length` header twice. Furthermore, invalid

  for TE:CL smuggling attacks."
