package_slug: "swift/leaf-kit"
title: "Leaf-kit html escaping does not work on characters that are part of extended
  grapheme cluster"
description: "`htmlEscaped` in leaf-kit will only escape html  special characters
  if the extended grapheme clusters match, which allows bypassing escaping by using
  an extended grapheme cluster containing both the special html character and some
  additional characters. In the case of html attributes, this can lead to XSS if there
  is a leaf variable in the attribute that is user controlled."
