title: "AWS SDK for Swift adopted defense in depth enhancement for region parameter
  value"
description: "CVSSv3.1 Rating: 3.7 (LOW)\n\nSummary\nThis notification is related
  to the use of specific values for the region input field when calling AWS services.
  An actor with access to the environment in which the SDK is used could set the region
  input field to an invalid value.\n\nA defense-in-depth enhancement has been implemented
  in the AWS SDK for Swift. This enhancement validates that a region used to construct
  an endpoint URL is a valid host label. The change was released on November 6, 2025.
  This advisory is informational to help customers understand their responsibilities
  regarding configuration security.\n\nImpact\nCustomer applications could be configured
  to improperly route AWS API calls to non-existent or non-AWS hosts. While the SDK
  was functioning safely within the requirements of the shared responsibility model,
  additional safeguards have been added to support secure customer implementations.\n\nImpacted
  versions: All versions prior to 2025-11-06 release (below 1.5.79)\n\nPatches\nOn
  November 6, 2025 an enhancement was made to the AWS SDK for Swift release, which
  validates the formatting of a region, providing additional safeguards.\n\nWorkarounds\nNo
  workarounds are needed, but as always you should ensure that your application is
  following security best practices:\n- Implement proper input validation in your
  application code\n- Update to the latest AWS SDK for Swift release on a regular
  basis\n- Follow AWS security best practices [1] for SDK configuration\n\nReferences\nContact
  AWS Security via the vulnerability reporting page or email [aws-security@amazon.com](mailto:aws-security@amazon.com).\n\nAcknowledgement\nAWS
  SDK thanks Guy Arazi for bringing these customer security considerations to our
  attention through the coordinated disclosure process.\n\n\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-swift/latest/developer-guide/security.html"
