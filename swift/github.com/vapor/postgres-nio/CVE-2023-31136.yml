title: "PostgresNIO processes unencrypted bytes from man-in-the-middle"
description: "Any user of PostgresNIO connecting to servers with TLS enabled is vulnerable
  to a man-in-the-middle attacker injecting false responses to the client's first
  few queries, despite the use of TLS certificate verification and encryption.\n\n_The
  remaining text in this section is quoted verbatim from [PostgreSQL's CVE-2021-23222
  advisory](https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/CVE-2021-23222/):_\n\n> If
  more preconditions hold, the attacker can exfiltrate the client's password or other
  confidential data that might be transmitted early in a session. The attacker must
  have a way to trick the client's intended server into making the confidential data
  accessible to the attacker. A known implementation having that property is a PostgreSQL
  configuration vulnerable to [CVE-2021-23214](https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/CVE-2021-23214/).
  As with any exploitation of [CVE-2021-23214](https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/CVE-2021-23214/),
  the server must be using trust authentication with a clientcert requirement or using
  cert authentication. To disclose a password, the client must be in possession of
  a password, which is atypical when using an authentication configuration vulnerable
  to [CVE-2021-23214](https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/CVE-2021-23214/).
  The attacker must have some other way to access the server to retrieve the exfiltrated
  data (a valid, unprivileged login account would be sufficient)."
