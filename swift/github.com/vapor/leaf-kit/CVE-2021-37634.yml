package_slug: "swift/github.com/vapor/leaf-kit"
title: "LeafKit allows XSS with untrusted user input"
description: "This affects anyone passing unsanitised data to Leaf's variable tags.
  Before this fix, Leaf would not escape any strings passed to tags as variables.
  If an attacker managed to find a variable that was rendered with their unsanitised
  data, they could inject scripts into a generated Leaf page, which could enable XSS
  attacks if other mitigations such as a Content Security Policy were not enabled."
