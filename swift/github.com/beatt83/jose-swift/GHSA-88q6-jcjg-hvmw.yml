title: "jose-swift has JWT Signature Verification Bypass via None Algorithm"
description: "An authentication bypass vulnerability allows any unauthenticated attacker
  to forge arbitrary JWT tokens by setting \"alg\": \"none\" in the token header.
  The library's verification functions immediately return `true` for such tokens without
  performing any cryptographic verification, enabling complete impersonation of any
  user and privilege escalation."
