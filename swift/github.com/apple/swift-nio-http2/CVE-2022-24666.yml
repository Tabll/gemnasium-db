title: "swift-nio-http2 vulnerable to denial of service via invalid HTTP/2 HEADERS
  frame length"
description: "A program using swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial of service
  attack, caused by a network peer sending a specially crafted HTTP/2 frame. This
  attack affects all swift-nio-http2 versions from 1.0.0 to 1.19.1. It is fixed in
  1.19.2 and later releases.\n\nThis vulnerability is caused by a logical error when
  parsing a HTTP/2 HEADERS frame where the frame contains priority information without
  any other data. This logical error caused confusion about the size of the frame,
  leading to a parsing error. This parsing error immediately crashes the entire process.\n\nSending
  a HEADERS frame with HTTP/2 priority information does not require any special permission,
  so any HTTP/2 connection peer may send such a frame. For clients, this means any
  server to which they connect may launch this attack. For servers, anyone they allow
  to connect to them may launch such an attack.\n\nThe attack is low-effort: it takes
  very little resources to send an appropriately crafted frame. The impact on availability
  is high: receiving the frame immediately crashes the server, dropping all in-flight
  connections and causing the service to need to restart. It is straightforward for
  an attacker to repeatedly send appropriately crafted frames, so attackers require
  very few resources to achieve a substantial denial of service.\n\nThe attack does
  not have any confidentiality or integrity risks in and of itself: swift-nio-http2
  is parsing the frame in memory-safe code, so the crash is safe. However, sudden
  process crashes can lead to violations of invariants in services, so it is possible
  that this attack can be used to trigger an error condition that has confidentiality
  or integrity risks.\n\nThe risk can be mitigated if untrusted peers can be prevented
  from communicating with the service. This mitigation is not available to many services.\n\nThe
  issue is fixed by rewriting the parsing code to correctly handle the condition.
  The issue was found by automated fuzzing by oss-fuzz."
