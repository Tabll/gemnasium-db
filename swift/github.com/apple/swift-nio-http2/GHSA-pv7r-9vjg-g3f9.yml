title: "Duplicate advisory: swift-nio-http2 vulnerable to denial of service via invalid
  HTTP/2 HEADERS frame length"
description: "## Duplicate Advisory\n\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it
  is a duplicate of GHSA-pgfx-g6rc-8cjv. This link is maintained to preserve external
  references.\n\n## Original Description\n\nA program using swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable
  to a denial of service attack, caused by a network peer sending a specially crafted
  HTTP/2 frame. This attack affects all swift-nio-http2 versions from 1.0.0 to 1.19.1.
  This vulnerability is caused by a logical error when parsing a HTTP/2 HEADERS frame
  where the frame contains priority information without any other data. This logical
  error caused confusion about the size of the frame, leading to a parsing error.
  This parsing error immediately crashes the entire process. Sending a HEADERS frame
  with HTTP/2 priority information does not require any special permission, so any
  HTTP/2 connection peer may send such a frame. For clients, this means any server
  to which they connect may launch this attack. For servers, anyone they allow to
  connect to them may launch such an attack. The attack is low-effort: it takes very
  little resources to send an appropriately crafted frame. The impact on availability
  is high: receiving the frame immediately crashes the server, dropping all in-flight
  connections and causing the service to need to restart. It is straightforward for
  an attacker to repeatedly send appropriately crafted frames, so attackers require
  very few resources to achieve a substantial denial of service. The attack does not
  have any confidentiality or integrity risks in and of itself: swift-nio-http2 is
  parsing the frame in memory-safe code, so the crash is safe. However, sudden process
  crashes can lead to violations of invariants in services, so it is possible that
  this attack can be used to trigger an error condition that has confidentiality or
  integrity risks. The risk can be mitigated if untrusted peers can be prevented from
  communicating with the service. This mitigation is not available to many services.
  The issue is fixed by rewriting the parsing code to correctly handle the condition.
  The issue was found by automated fuzzing by oss-fuzz."
