title: "swift-nio-http2 affected by HTTP/2 MadeYouReset vulnerability"
description: "The HTTP/2 [MadeYouReset vulnerability](https://galbarnahum.com/made-you-reset)
  has a mild effect on swift-nio-http2.\n\nswift-nio-http2 mostly protects against
  MadeYouReset by using a number of existing denial-of-service prevention patterns
  that we added in response to the RapidReset vulnerabilities. The result is that
  servers are not vulnerable to naive attacks based on MadeYouReset, and the naive
  PoC examples do not affect swift-nio-http2.\n\nHowever, in 1.38.0 we added some
  defense-in-depth measures as a precautionary measure that detect clients behaving
  \"weirdly\". These defense in depth measures tackle resource drain attacks where
  attackers interleave attack traffic with legitimate traffic to try to evade our
  existing DoS prevention mechanisms.\n\nWe recommend all adopters move to 1.38.0
  as soon as possible to mitigate against more sophisticated attacks that may appear
  in the future.\n\nWe are very grateful to @galbarnahum, @AnatBB, and @YanivRL for
  their reporting and assistance with our process."
