title: "CVE-2025-0343: Swift ASN.1 can crash when parsing maliciously formed BER/DER"
description: "Swift ASN.1 can be caused to crash when parsing certain BER/DER constructions.
  This crash is caused by a confusion in the ASN.1 library itself which assumes that
  certain objects can only be provided in either constructed or primitive forms, and
  will trigger a `preconditionFailure` if that constraint isn't met.\n\nImportantly,
  these constraints are actually required to be true in DER, but that correctness
  wasn't enforced on the early node parser side so it was incorrect to rely on it
  later on in decoding, which is what the library did.\n\nThese crashes can be triggered
  when parsing any DER/BER format object. There is no memory-safety issue here: the
  crash is a graceful one from the Swift runtime. The impact of this is that it can
  be used as a denial-of-service vector when parsing BER/DER data from unknown sources,
  e.g. when parsing TLS certificates.\n\nMany thanks to @baarde for reporting this
  issue and providing the fix."
