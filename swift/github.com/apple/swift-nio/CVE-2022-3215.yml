title: "SwiftNIO vulnerable to Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers
  ('HTTP Response Splitting')"
description: "`NIOHTTP1` and projects using it for generating HTTP responses, including
  SwiftNIO, can be subject to a HTTP Response Injection attack. This occurs when a
  HTTP/1.1 server accepts user generated input from an incoming request and reflects
  it into a HTTP/1.1 response header in some form. A malicious user can add newlines
  to their input (usually in encoded form) and \"inject\" those newlines into the
  returned HTTP response.\n\nThis capability allows users to work around security
  headers and HTTP/1.1 framing headers by injecting entirely false responses or other
  new headers. The injected false responses may also be treated as the response to
  subsequent requests, which can lead to XSS, cache poisoning, and a number of other
  flaws.\n\nThis issue was resolved by adding a default channel handler that polices
  outbound headers. This channel handler is added by default to channel pipelines,
  but can be removed by users if they are doing this validation themselves."
